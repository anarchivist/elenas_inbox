    TEXT:
    Today, the Senate began floor consideration of Energy & Water
    Appropriations bill to continue debate tomorrow morning.   please provide
    comments or clearance (5.-4790) by 9am tomorrow, Thursday, June 18.  Thank
    you.

    S. 2138 -- ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT
                                 APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
    1999
    (Sponsors:  Stevens (R), Alaska; Domenici (R), New Mexico)


            This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
    AdministrationO,s views on S. 2138, the Energy and Water Development
    Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations'
    Committee. Your consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be
'.
     appreciated.

             The Administration appreciates the challenges faced by the
     Committee in funding a wide array of needs within tight budgetary
     constraints. However, we are concerned that the $566 million increase
     provided by the Committee for Army Corps of Engineers projects has come at
     the expense of other priority programs.

             The Committee mark eliminates all of the Administration's
     requested increase for the solar and renewable energy program, including
     eliminating funding for valuable cost-shared projects with industry, and
     the Committee Report expresses misguided concerns about projects related
     to commercialization of new technologies. The CommitteeD,s funding level
     represents a reduction of about one-third -- over $100 million -- in the
     PresidentD,s requested increase for development of clean, non-greenhouse
     gas power sources. These changes would seriously undercut the Department
     of EnergyO,'s ability to continue some of the most promising research now
     underway, eliminate accelerated introduction of clean power sources, and
     restrict our ability to lower greenhouse gas emissions levels. The
     Administration strongly opposes these reductions and will work with the
     Congress to restore funding to this critical area.

             We urge the Committee to fund fully the request for the California
     Bay-Delta program. The Committee's $78 million reduction to the request
     could delay Federal and State efforts to restore this important ecosystem.

             We commend the Committee for fully funding the construction costs
     of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in FY 1999. The SNS will provide
     path-breaking research opportunities in the physical, biological, and
     medical sciences and will ensure continued u.S. pre-eminence in neutron
     sciences and their industrial and medical applications. Likewise, the
     Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s support for the Stockpile
     Stewardship and Management Program and for funding TVA's non-power
     programs.

             The Committee bill would prevent obligation of funds for design of
     a facility to dispose of plutonium contained in excess weapons until
     agreement is reached with Russia on a bilateral schedule for plutonium
     disposition. The Administration shares the CommitteeO,s view that the
     United States should dispose of excess plutonium only in parallel with
     Russia.  However, we do not agree with the Committee's approach. The
     Administration will work with the Committee to find an alternative way of
     addressing our mutual concerns.

             Finally, the proposed language in section 306 of the Committee
     bill would generally impair the Department of EnergyD,s ability to ship
     transuranic waste to the Waste Isolation pilot plant (WIPP).  In
     particular, this language would prevent closure of the Rocky Flats site by
     2006, eliminate potential savings of up to $1 billion, and potentially add
     costs of as much as $60 million.  In addition, transuranic waste at the
     Savannah River, Hanford, Mound, and Los Alamos sites could not be removed
     for disposal at WIPP.
