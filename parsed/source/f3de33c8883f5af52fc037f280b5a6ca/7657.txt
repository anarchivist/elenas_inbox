TEXT:
Bruce, Jon, Mike, Elena and Maria:

Ron Klain has relayed a message to me from POTUS requesting that NPR take
a look at the issue of bilingual education and determine if we can think
of a way to "reinvent" it.  I have spoken with Karen Skelton for some of
the background on this issue, which I have been tangentially involved
with before. What I would like to do is have a small meeting with those
who have worked the issue until now to get your perspective on what else
might be done or ideas you may have on what might be the cause of this
request.  NPR will not be taking this one on until we have a chance to
talk and see if there are ways we might be helpful.  Jen Muller is trying
to find a time next week when most of us could get together on the
subject.  Your cooperation in finding such a rare hour next week would be
very much appreciated.
Morley
