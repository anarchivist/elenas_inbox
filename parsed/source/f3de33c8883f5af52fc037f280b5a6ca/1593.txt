                                  For Discussion on Outcomes

By the time the Commission completes its work on January 20, 1998, you will have
accomplished the following:

       First, by heading this initiative through high-profile town hall meetings and a
       commission, you provided Presidential leadership that raised and sustained this issue to a
       height in the nation's psyche that it had not found except for discrete periods and only in
       times of trouble.

       Second, despite the divisiveness that this issue often bears and bore in some cases over
       the past eight months, you framed and focused the debate with a positive, futuristic focus.
        Through this leadership and the commission, the country gained a genuine appreciation
       of racial diversity as one of America's true strengths.

       Third, through your participation in the town hall meetings in particular, the country
       initiated, engaged and continues to engage in a far-reaching, constructive dialogue on
       racial issues between the races and among races.

       Fourth, because of the commission's research, scholarship and public hearings, the
       American public received precise, accurate and concrete information on our racial history
       and destiny.

       Fifth, due to the receipt of accurate and insightful information, the races gained a more
       accurate perception about themselves and how they perceive each other. This
       information brought the perception gap closer and debunked some of the myths and
       half-truths that have crept into the perceptions of one race's view of the other and itself.

       Sixth, your leadership on this issue and the commission's work started a process that
       reversed, or at least halted, the disturbing trend of "resegregation" occurring throughout
       the nation.

       Seventh, the commission provided concrete, specific recommendations for moving
       forward to achieve a nation that gains strength from its dynamic racial composition.

       Eighth, you stimulated a network of communities provided ...
                                                                           Hex-DiJmp Conve:1lion
                                     Discussion on Mission

The commission will be charged with helping America prepare today for a 21 st Century with a
rapidly changing racial composition. Their task is to do the following:

       1) help lead all Americans towards "One America" by bringing the races together through
       dialogue and education, and

       2) raise and answer the tough questions facing an America with a dynamic and diverse
       population.

In particular, the commission could focus on the following areas as they affect our diverse nation:
criminal justice system, education, housing, employment, melting pot tensions and economic
issues. In fulfilling their charter, the commission will work to

       1) heighten awareness of the importance of rising above race;

       2) promote reconciliation;

       3) confront negative stereotypes;

       4) close the gap between the perceptions of the races;

       5) encourage rational discourse on divisive issues;

       6) provide an update on the state ofrace relations and discrimination in the U.S. today,
       including a report on our progress since the Kerner Commission;

       7) provide recommendations for moving the country forward; and

       8) offer a selection of realistic action items which you could pledge to pursue.
