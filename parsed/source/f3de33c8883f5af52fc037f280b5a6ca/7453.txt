TEXT:
As a follow up on Bruce's request, I've listed some possible hooks for a
.08 statement or event. We could release DOT's report back to the
President on .08 in concert with any of these options:

 DOT Annual Report on Fatalities: DOT is about to release their annual
preliminary 1997 numbers on highway fatalities.  While the overall number
is about level from last year (about 42,000), the percentage of
alcohol-related fatalities dropped slightly from 40.7% to 39.3%. While
this is a modest decreas~, this is the first time the alcohol-related rate
has ever fallen below 40% since they've collected this data. I believe DOT
could hold this report until we want to release it.

lOth Anniversary of Kentucky Crash:  On May 14, MADD is holding an event
in Carrollton, Kentucky to commemorate the lOth anniversary of the worst
drunk driving crash in u.S. history, where over 40 kids were killed when a
drunk driver hit a school bus. MADD will be calling for .08 legislation
at the event. The media attention should be pretty good; MADD has already
arranged to go on all the morning shows the day of the event.  Since the
President will be abroad, this could be a VP event w/ a Presidential
statement.

Upcoming State Votes:

Zero Tolerance:  In the next couple of weeks, South Carolina will vote on
zero tolerance for underage drinking and driving -- we don't have a firm
date but probably not before May 15.   South Carolina will be the final
state to pass zero tolerance. We could do a message saying that this
marks the final step for zero tolerance, and it is time to take the next
step to stop drunk driving through enacting .08 .

. 08 BAC: D.C. and Rhode Island will both vote on .08 laws soon. Rhode
Island's vote may be happening in the next day or two.  DC hasn't
scheduled their vote yet, but MADD expects it to be soon. Since we don't
really know the timing here, these probably aren't our best options.
FYI: Our state total of .08 states is now up to 16 -- Washington passed
their law since the event.

Please let me know if any of these meet the threshold of excitement for
another event or radio address.  Thanks.
