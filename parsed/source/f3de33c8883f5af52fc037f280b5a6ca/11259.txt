TEXT:
Q:      Do you agree with eBOD,s positive review of the potential of a
premium support model?

A:      We have consistently indicated our openness to considering a premium
support model as one way to strengthen and modernize the Medicare
program. However, we have also said, as does CBO, that the details of
such a program are essential to determining whether this is a positive way
to reform Medicare. The President and the Administration look forward to
receiving more information on the specifics of this approach as the
Commission proceeds.
