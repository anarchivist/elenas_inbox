TEXT:
Elena,

I am leaving in a few minutes, so I suppose we can have our conversation
about the Race Initiative another day. Actually, I am going to be at my
house packing for the rest of the day and into the night and wouldn't at
all mind your calling me there to talk. Though I am moving tomorrow (so
more or less out of commission) you can call me over the week-end (at my
new number: I P6/(b)(61 h. [06~1

A lot of my thinking about this has been informed both by conversations
with folks at the Initiative and my involvement in the planning of the
last Board meeting (Fairfax) and the upcoming meeting in Phoenix.
Apparently, the folks at the PIR (including Judy) have had some big
picture discussions about the objectives of the Board and the Initiative
and have asked to meet with Sylvia about this next week (maybe Monday). I
am not sure what the agenda of this meeting is or even if it is going to
happen. Either way, we should talk before then.
