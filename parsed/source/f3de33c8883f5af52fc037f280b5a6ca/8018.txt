President's order protects workers
Anti-Gay discrimination banned in civilian jobs

by Peter Freiberg

It was only three paragraphs long and received little publicity. But an
executive order issued by President Bill Clinton last week, banning
anti-Gay discrimination against federal civilian employees, was
nevertheless historic, capping a 41-year struggle to end bias in the
federal workforce.

Court decisions, civil service rules, and legislation have given Gay
federal employees significant - though inconsistent - protection over the
years. Clinton's May 28 action formally adds sexual orientation to
Executive Order 11478, which banned job discrimination against federal
workers based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap and
age.

"The order," Clinton said in a statement, "provides a uniform policy for
the federal government to prohibit discrimination based on sexual
orientation in the federal civilian workforce and states that policy for
the first time in an executive order of the president."

The White House had previously encouraged agencies to include sexual
orientation in their non-discrimination policies. Many did so, but a Blade
survey last year turned up a significant number that didn't. Even many
agencies that formally banned anti-Gay job bias failed to publicize
enforcement procedures, according to a Gay federal employee group.

Frank Kameny, the longtime Washington activist whose dismissal on grounds
of homosexuality in 1957 led him to begin the fight to end the federal
government's anti-Gay job bias, joined other activists in hailing Clinton's
executive order, which covers 1.8 million civilian workers.

"It doesn't do anything new," said Kameny, now 73, "but it ties up loose
ends and, therefore, brings to closure to what has been a
25-year ... improvement process . . . . The deed is done, it is over, we can move
on to other battles. It is a total victory which could not have been
conceived when I was fired in 1957."

Elaine Kaplan, the openly Lesbian special counsel in the U.S. Office of
Special Counsel, said that, while the executive order doesn't add "any new
substantive legal rights," it does "confirm that it is executive branch
policy" to bar anti-Gay discrimination in the federal workforce.

"I think it will help employees who suffer discrimination based on their
sexual orientation," Kaplan said. "It will·bolster their cases."

"What we were trying to do," said Richard Socarides,     a special assistant to
Clinton and his liaison with the Gay community, "was     remedy the fact that a
lot of federal workers did not know that the federal     government did not
discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, and     that they in fact had
remedies to pursue a claim of ... discrimination."



The executive order, Socarides said, "is going to allow us now to proceed
on a public education campaign" to inform federal workers "that they have
these rights and what the procedures are to enforce violations."

Despite the executive ·order, Gay federal workers still lack significant
protection enjoyed by their straight counterparts, for two major reasons:

First, uniformed members of th~ armed services are automatically excluded
from the protection offered by the executive order, since they are covered
by the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue" policy proposed by Clinton and
approved by Congress. That policy, under challenge in the courts as
discriminatory, is strongly defended by the Administration. And,

Second, sexual orientation is not covered by the 1964 civil Rights Act,
which means, as Clinton noted in his statement, that the executive order
"cannot create any new enforcement rights," such as the ability to bring
bias complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

Reiterating his support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, Clinton
said, "I again call upon Congress to pass this important piece of civil
rights legislation, which would extend these basic employment
discrimination protections to all Gay and Lesbian Americans."

"Individuals," Clinton said, "should not be denied a job on the basis of
something that has no relationship to their ability to perform their work."

Rob Sadler, an attorney with the Department of Commerce and president of
Federal GLOBE (Gay,Lesbian or Bisexual Employees), said that, even though
Gay federal workers still lacked civil rights protection, the executive
order has "more than symbolic" significance.

While many agencies have announced nondiscrimination policies that include
Gays, Sadler said, the executive order will be "another impetus" to get
laggard agencies to issue similar statements. Also, he said, the order will
spur many agencies to publicize the previously "hidden procedures"
available to Gays to complain about discrimination.

These procedures include filing an administrative complaint within an
agency (though barred from appealing that agency's decision to the EEOC or
the courts). In addition, employees who believe they have been fired or
suspended for more than 14 days due to sexual orientation discrimination
can complain to the Merit Systems Protection Board.                                ·

Less serious complaints, like a failure to receive a promotion or a
transfer, can be submitted as a grievance by employees covered under
collective bargaining agreements, or can be filed with the Office of
Special Counsel, which investigates possible violations of "prohibited
personnel practices," including sexual orientation discrimination.

In the past, Sadler said, many agencies argued that because sexual
orientation is not included in civil rights law, they had no authority to
implement and publicize those protections that Gays did enjoy.

"Most agencies had issued non-discrimination policies," Sadler says, "but
had not followed up to tell employees what does his mean, where you can go
[to complain]. In that sense, many of the non-discrimination statemen~s may
have been symbolic."

The executive order, Sadler said, in effect tells agencies to explicitly


detail and distribute the cemplaint precedures fer empleyees who. believe
they have been subjected to. anti-Gay discriminatien.

"That will be a majer change," said Sadler. "Our werk environment is
different new than it was [befere the executive erder]."

Kaplan ef the U.S. Office ef Special Ceunsel agreed that many Gay federal
empleyees are net aware ef the pretectien against discriminatien that they
have gained ever the years.

"New, hepefully the executive erder will draw mere attentien to. it," Kaplan
said.

Twenty years age, the Civil Service Referm Act ef 1978 put into. law
regulatery changes, made in 1975 in respense to. ceurt decisiens, that
remeved hemesexuality as a bar to. federal and civil service civilian
empleyment and premetien.

The 1978 law prehibited discriminatien against federal empleyees fer
"cenduct which dees net adversely affect" their jeb perfermance. That has·
been interpreted as making sexual erientatien discriminatien a "prehibited
persennel practice." (The law did net affect the issuing ef security
clearances by such agencies as the FBI and CIA, which denied clearances to.
Gays en greunds hemesexuality might subject them to. blackmail.)

During his 1992 presidential campaign, Clinten premised to. sign an
executive erder barring sexual empleyment discriminatien in the federal
civilian werkplace (and anether erder ending the ban en Gay military
persennel). When the military plan came under intense fire frem the
Pentagen and Cengress during his first weeks in effice, Clinten backtracked
en that erder - and the civilian directive went en held.

"The likely time to. have dene [the civilian erder] weuld have been at the
very beginning ef the Administratien," says Secarides. "Having beenthreugh
feur er five menths areund the debate en Gays in the military, I weuld say
that the pelitical climate fer deing this by way ef executive erder was
prebably net cenducive."

Instead, repertedly believing that an erder pretecting Gay federal civilian
empleyees· might be everturned by Cengress, the Administratien in late 1993
decided to. enceurage individual agencies to. issue pelicies banning sexual
orientatien discriminatien. (In 1995, Clinten signed an executive erder
that barred federal agencies frem denying security clearances to. applicants
selely en the basis ef sexual erientatien.)

But last year's investigatien by the Blade shewed that almest 25 percent ef
federal empleyees had net been fermally netified in pelicy statements that
sexual erientatien discriminatien against federal civilian empleyees is
illegal. The Blade survey feund that three ef the gevernment's 16 cabinet
departments and 39 ef its 72 independent agencies had net added sexual
erientatien to. their nen-discriminatien statements.

Secarides said the Blade survey was instrumental in leading the White Heuse
to. undertake its ewn legal and pelicy review, which Secarides said
cenfirmed "cenfusien by persennel managers and federal empleyees as to.
exactly what their rights were."

As a result, Secarides said, Bruce Reed, who. heads Clinten's Demestic
Pelicy Ceuncil, asked his staff early this year to. prepare the executive
erder.



"While for the most part the federal government is a good place for Gays
and Lesbians to work," Socarides said, "clearly there are pockets where
Gays and Lesbians suffer from discrimination. This sends a message . . . . It
makes the federal government the largest employer with a written sexual
orientation non-discrimination policy."

Sadler said GLOBE, which has 40 affiliates with 4,000 to 6,000 members, had
hoped Clinton would issue the executive order sooner. But with hindsight,
says Federal GLOBE past president Leonard Hirsch, he is glad the executive
order was delayed.

"This process of doing it agency by agency meant that [GLOBE] had to
educate a lot of people," Hirsch said. "That process is really at the heart
of any non-discrimination program: Getting people to understand what is
discrimination, why it's bad and how it can be stopped and fought ....

"Having done [the executive order] much earlier would have been
symbolically important," Hirsch said, "and would have made us all feel
good, but having done it this way gives us a much more long-lasting
solution."

The executive order drew a strong attack from the anti-Gay Family Research
Council, whose president, Gary Bauer, called on Congress to rescind the
"outrageous" directive.

In a statement, Bauer said the order will affect not only all federal
employees, but "possibly anyone who received a federal grant or contract
with the federal government.

"In other words, it will force a special preference for homosexuality into
government and private workplaces," Bauer asserted.

But Chai Feldblum, professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center,
said there is no reference in the executive order to federal contractors or
affirmative action.

"It would be nice to have a prohibition [on anti-Gay discrimination] for
every entity that receives a federal contract," Feldblum said, "but this is
not what the executive order does."

"Waving the specter of affirmative action is a classic misstatement that
the [Family Research Council] always makes," said Feldblum. "They
automatically assume that anti-discrimination means affirmative action.
That's simply wrong."

The Washington Times quoted House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Tex.), a
religious right supporter, as attacking the order.

"Once again," Armey said, "this Administration pushes extreme policies on
behalf of a narrow special interest group . . . . 1 calIon the president to
reconsider this decision."

Two national Gay organizations - the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force
and the Human Rights Campaign - hailed Clinton's action.

HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg said she is certain Bauer will
find some support among legislators for his call to rescind the executive
order. But Stachelberg said that, with corporations increasingly adopting
policies barring anti-Gay job discrimination and with polls finding most


Americans saying they oppose such discrimination, she doubts Congress will
overturn Clinton's directive.

"I don't see Congress being out of step with .the American people, being out
of step with corporate America," Stachelberg said.
