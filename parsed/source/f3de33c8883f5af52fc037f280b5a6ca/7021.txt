                                        TobaccoQ&As
                                         April 8, 1998



Q:    What's your reaction to RJR Nabisco CEO Steven Goldstone's remarks today at the
      National Press Club?

A:    It is no surprise that the tobacco industry would protest the legislation moving through the
      Congress -- it is in their best interest to object to the bill now in order to prevent it from
      getting tougher on youth smoking. Why should we believe protests from an industry that
      won't admit that they marketed cigarettes to kids and still won't say cigarettes are
      addictive?

      We still believe that the tobacco industry will have every incentive to agree to legislation
      in the end, so that they can end this shameful chapter in their history and start off on a
      new path. In any event, the industry does not have veto power over what we do, and we
      will not back off such necessary measures to reduce youth smoking.

Q:    WiU this deal drive RJR and/or other tobacco companies into bankruptcy?

A:    No. We're not trying to put the tobacco companies out of business; we want to put them
      out of the business of selling cigarettes to kids. We've done some careful financial
      analysis of the McCain bill, and we do not believe that it will drive companies into
      bankruptcy. The tobacco industry has financial difficulties because because of its
      massive liability risk, and this deal certainly doesn't increase that risk. Stopping
      companies from selling cigarettes to kids will not put them out of business.

Q:    But don't you need industry cooperation to enact tobacco legislation?

A:    We would like the tobacco industry to willingly join us in this effort to reduce youth
      smoking. But we can make progess even ifthey refuse to join us. We still believe that
      the tobacco industry will have every incentive to agree to legislation in the end, so that
      they can end this shameful chapter in their history and start off on a new path. In any
      event, the industry does not have veto power over what we do, and we will not back off
      such necessary measures to reduce youth smoking.

                    THE PRESIDENT MEETS WITH KENTUCKY
                  TOBACCO FARMERS AND CALLS FOR PASSAGE
                  OF COMPREHENSIVE TOBACCO LEGISLATION
                                April 9, 1998

Today, the President traveled to Carrollton, Kentucky to meet with tobacco farmers and to
address students at Carroll County High School. The President's trip highlights his
commitment to reducing youth smoking and protecting farmers, which are key elements of
the bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation the President has called on Congress to
pass this year.

Roundtable with Tobacco Farmers and Members of the Farming Community
The President held a roundtable discussion in the Kentuckiana Tobacco Warehouse with
tobacco farmers and members of the community, including a student and tobacco
warehouse owner. The panel also included Rod Kuegel, the President of the Burley
Tobacco Growers Cooperative -- an organization that represents 150,000 tobacco farm
families in five states -- and Bill Sprague, the President of the Kentucky Farm Bureau -- the
largest farming organization in the state. This roundtable provided an opportunity for the
President to listen to the concerns of farmers and the community regarding comprehensive
tobacco legislation.

Addressing Students at Carroll County High School
The President also addressed approximately 2200 students and adults at the Carroll
County High School where he emphasized his commitment to reducing youth smoking.
The President was joined by Senator Ford, Governor Patton, and Agriculture Secretary
Glickman. The President noted that every day 3,000 children will become regular
smokers, and 1,000 will die prematurely as a result, and he urged Congress to pass his plan
for comprehensive tobacco legislation which will save one million lives over the next five
years.

President's Key Principles
On September 17th, President Clinton announced the five key principles that must be included in
any comprehensive tobacco legislation. They are:

1.     Tough penalties and price increases to reduce youth smoking. Price increases of up to
       $1.50 if necessary over the next ten years.

2.     Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products, including authority of the
       manufacture, sale, and advertising of tobacco products.

3.     The tobacco industry must change the way it does business, including stopping
       advertising to children.

4.     There needs to be progress towards other public health goals including cutting
       second-hand smoke and increasing funding for health research and cessation programs.

5_   There should be protection for tobacco farmers and their communities so they do not
     suffer economically because of this legislation.
