TEXT:
Unless we ask the Education Department to hold it for a POTUS event, the
Education Department is about to release the third-year of their national
charter school study.   I haven't seen the study yet, but it sounds like
it doesn't break much new ground -- but it does contain updates from
previous years on such issues as school size, reasons parents give for
sending their kids to charter schools, reasons for starting schools, etc.

If the president is not going to an event on this, the Education
Department wants to give an ,embargoed copy to Education Week tomorrow to
be published next week during their national charter school conference in
Denver.

Bruce and Elena, do you want Education to hold off on releasing the
report? Karin, would there be an opportunity for a POTUS charter school
event later this month? POTUS could visit a DC charter school and 1)
release the report, 2) highlight the choice $ in the FY2000 budget, and 3)
perhaps announce the competition for the new funds won in the FY99 budget.
