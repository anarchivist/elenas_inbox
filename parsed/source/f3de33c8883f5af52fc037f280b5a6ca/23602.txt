                                       Statement by the President
                                             April 20, 1999



    I am pleased that a little more than a year after I proposed the idea of a national Ed-Flex bill to
    the National Governors' Association, Congress appears ready to send me legislation I can sign.
    This bill will offer states more flexibility in their use of federal funding in exchange for
    demonstrated increases in student achievement. I am particularly pleased that the conference
    report strengthens accountability measures and preserves our effort to reduce class size in the
    early grades. The bipartisan work on this legislation shows we can and must work together to
    improve our nation's schools. Now Congress can move on to the most important aspects of the
    nation's education agenda -- finishing the job of hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers to reduce
    class size, passing my initiative to help build and modernize 6,000 public schools, and my plan to
    hold states and school districts accountable for results.
