TEXT:
Two Possible additions:

1. Native Americans-- This seems to be missing and Mary will contact
Julie F. to suggest achievements and tasks.

2. Civil Rights Backlog-- the report mentions the backlog but does not
devote even a bullet to our Civil Rights Enforcements Initiative.

below is the bullet's we used ...

 Civil Rights Enforcement Initiative. The Administration proposed in its
Fiscal Year 1999 budget a package of civil rights enforcement initiatives
that places new emphasis on prevention and non-litigation remedies for
discrimination and strengthens civil rights agenciesD, ability to enforce
anti-discrimination law. The plan promotes prevention by providing
increased resources for compliance reviews and technical assistance, and
offers an alternative to expensive litigation by funding a dramatic
expansion of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms.  The plan
also sets specific performance goals for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) to speed processing of complaints and reduce case
backlog, and provides for greater coordination across federal agencies and
offices. The Clinton AdministrationD,s Fiscal Year 1999 balanced budget
contains $602 million for civil rights enforcement agencies and offices
an increase of $86 million, or more than 16 percent, over last yearD,s
funding.
 Reforming and Strengthening the EEOC. The centerpiece of this initiative
expands the EEOCD,s ADR program over three years to allow as many as 70
percent of all complainants to choose mediation, rather than the lengthy
process of investigation and litigation.  In the first year of this expans
ion, the EEOC will provide ADR in a projected 16,000 cases -- 20 percent
of all incoming cases and double the number currently sent to mediation.
The AdministrationD,s budget also sets specific performance goals for the
EEOC to reduce its backlog. Through a combination of the increased use of
mediation, improved information technology, and an expanded investigative
staff, the EEOC will reduce the average time it takes to resolve private
sector complaints from over 9.4 months to 6 months, and reduce the backlog
of cases from 64,000 to 28,000, by the year 2000.  In total, the budget
requests $279 million for the EEOC for FY 1999 -- $37 million or 15
percent more than the enacted 1998 budget. More than one-third of the
proposed increase ($13 million) goes to expansion of the agencyO,s ADR
program.
