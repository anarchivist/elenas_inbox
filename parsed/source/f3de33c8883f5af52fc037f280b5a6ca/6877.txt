TEXT:
I have heard from WH Leg Affairs that'it looks unlikely that the House
rule on ISTEA will permit a vote on the Lowey .08 BAC amendment. The
Rules Committee is scheduled to vote on the rule at 8:00pm tonight.

On a separate but related matter, the Justice Department is prepared to
announce formula grants ($360,000 to each state) to combat underage
drinking.  If we want to beat up on the House for failing to vote on .08,
the grants could give us an additional opportunity to do it.  The
Department is holding the announcement until Friday, but we could probably
get them to hold on longer if necessary.

At the very least, we could get a quote in the DOJ release or do our own
statement.  If we want to further highlight, we could have the VP
announce, or do a radio address.  Please let me know if there is interest
in any of these options.

Thanks,
Leanne,
