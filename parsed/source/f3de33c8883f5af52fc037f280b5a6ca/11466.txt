                                      POT US Statement on Title I
                                           March 1, 1999


     Today, the Education Department is releasing an assessment of Title I that shows that we have
     made progress in improving achievement for students in high-poverty schools, but that a
     substantial gap remains between these students and others. This report makes clear that we have
     been heading in the right direction, while providing compelling evidence that we must
     dramatically increase the pace of reform. That is why we must work across party lines to enact
     my Education Accountability Act, ensuring that states and school districts end social promotion,
     phase-out the use of unqualified teachers, turn around low-performing schools, provide parents
     with report cards on schools, and implement effective discipline policies. And that is why we
     need to make targeted investments to help our children reach high standards, starting with a vote
     this week to reduce class size in the early grades by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers.
     Today's news of improvement is welcome, but we should not be satisfied until all our students
     can reach the challenging standards we set for them.
