TEXT:
At a hate crimes mtg with gay & lesbian groups earlier this week, we heard
a couple of policy recommendations for the conference:

* make it mandatory for jurisdictions to report serial killers to the feds
* fix VAWA and VOCA to keep them from discriminating against groups that
represent lesbian victims.

Socarides knows more.  I don't know if either of these ideas work.    I like
the first, but I don't know if it's feasible.
