                       REPORT ON CRIME PREVENTION
                                                                       April 24, 1997




Background
The 1996 Department of Justice (DOJ) appropriations bill required a comprehensive study of
the effectiveness ofDOJ grants to local communities for law enforcement and crime prevention
efforts. Special emphasis was to be given to factors relating to juvenile violence.

The study released last week was completed by criminologists from the University of Maryland.
Researchers studied existing evaluations of over $3 billion of DOJ spending, including: COPS
funding, prison construction, drug courts, Byrne grants, and juvenile justice formula grants.

The report organizes crime prevention efforts by section into the institutional settings where
crime prevention efforts can take place: families, schools, labor markets, and the legal institution
settings of policing and criminal justice.

Report Conclusions
> Key overall finding: the most effective crime prevention funding is directed to urban,
      low-income, high crime neighborhoods where youth violence is highly concentrated.

Police. The report found that the effectiveness of additional police in preventing crime depends
on how well they are focused on tasks and problems. Formula and block grants for policing
were found to be less effective than discretionary grants since they are generally allocated on the
basis of population instead of on the basis of serious crime.

       _ What works: policing crime "hot spots" through directed patrols in high crime areas;
       targeting serious repeat offenders through proactive arrests; and selective arrest in
       domestic violence cases.

       _ What's promising: community policing with focus on problem-oriented policing and
       improving police legitimacy, and adding extra police to cities.

       _ What doesn't work: neighborhood watch programs and arresting juveniles for minor
       offenses.

       How DOJ Programs Reflect Report's Results: The COPS office is providing funding for
       100,000 police officers--more than 57,000 have been funded to date. The Office of
       Justice Programs is building prisons to incarcerate serious, violent offenders.

Communities. Most crime happens in a small minority of communities; yet crime prevention
programs are not restricted to these neighborhoods. The study found that crime prevention
programs are likely to work in communities that need them the least, while communities with the
greatest crime problems are the hardest to reach.
                                                                                        I
                                                                                    clinton Presidential Records
                                           Automateq Records Management System      Automated Records
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion              Management System (Email)
       programs had a strong effect on both crime and drug use.

       _ Whal Doesn 'I Work: community mobilization and gun buy-back programs.

       How DO] Programs Reflect Report's Results: The Weed and Seed program targets
       violence prevention funding in specific, high-crime neighborhoods. Funding from the
       Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program is also directed toward high-crime
       communities.

Families. Family risk factors have a major effect on crime. The earlier the risk factors can be
addressed in life, the greater the impact. Programs for infants and young children may be the
most cost-effective in the long-run, even if they are the most expensive in the short term.
However, family violence by adults was found to be more difficult to address.

       _ What works: home visitation by nurses and social workers for infants in troubled
       families and family therapy by clinical staff for delinquent youth.

       _ What's promising: battered women's shelters and temporary restraining orders.

       _ Whal doesn 'I work: mandatory arrest in misdemeanor domestic violence cases where
       offender is unemployed and home visitation by police as a follow up to domestic violence
       incidents.

       How DO] Programs Reflect Report's Results: The Office of Juvenile Justice Prevention
       (OJJDP) and Weed and Seed are including home visitation components in their program
       plans for this year. VA WGO and STOP grants may be used to enhance prosecution of
       domestic violence cases, including increasing the number of temporary restraining orders.

Criminal Justice. The study found that there is little evidence that increased incarceration has
reduced crime. However, variations in how the criminal justice system treats admitted offenders
can make a significant difference.

       _ What works: focused and structured rehabilitation programs, prison-based drug
       treatment, and incarceration of high-volume repeat offenders.

       _ What's promising: drug courts, day fines, and juvenile aftercare.

       _ Whal doesn't work: "scared straight" programs and old-style military boot camps.

       How DO] Programs Reflect Report's Results: DOJ is funding a residential substance
       abuse treatment program for state prisoners. The Drug Courts program was doubled
       from $15 million to $30 million.


                                                                             Clinton Presidential Records

into the labor market for legitimate work. Programs aimed at linking labor markets more closely
to high crime neighborhoods and individuals could have substantial crime prevention benefits.

       _ What works: short-term vocational training for older male ex-offenders who are no
       longer involved in the criminal justice system.

       _ What's promising: job corps, prison-based vocational education for adults, and
       Enterprise Zone programs.

       _ What doesn't work: summer jobs and subsidized jobs for youth.

Schools. Schools have significant potential as a setting to prevent crime. However, the report
found numerous school-based programs to be ineffective including the DARE program. It
should be noted that the Department of Education is currently working with DARE to improve
their curriculum in light of recent criticisms of the program-- and the report acknowledges that
their conclusion is based on the umevised curriculum.

          What works: programs aimed at establishing behavioral norms, such as school rules,
       and programs that focus on developing social competency skills (e.g., self-control, stress
       management).

           What doesn't work: peer-group counseling, recreation and community service
       activities without a strong prevention component.

       How DOJ Programs Reflect Report's Results: Justice is funding a national study of
       school-based prevention programs to document the extent to which students can be
       engaged in school activities that reduce opportunities for crime.

Report Recommendations
The report concludes that researchers were unable to determine how a majority of federal funding
affects crime due to a dearth of program evaluation. To remedy this, the report's primary
recommendation is to set aside 10% of all crime prevention funding to conduct program
evaluations.

Your Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Legislation contains a similar approach. The legislation
calls for 10% of juvenile justice grant funding to be reserved for research on program
effecti veness.
