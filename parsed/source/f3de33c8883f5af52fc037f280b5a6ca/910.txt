TEXT:
and an additional comment on the memorandum -- HHS wanted to include
"practical resources" - which would include things such as 1-800 numbers,
   so the language change might be -
1. a comprehensive list and assessment of existing projects, practical
resources, and programs ....

- while projects I think covers just about everything - there point is
well taken that a brochure or resource manuel might not be covered. Which
reminds me ... the other agency we should include here is the Consumer,
Product, Safety Commission.

In the letter I suggest we ask them to focus their initial responses on
planned and proposed projects since that is the area we are most lacking
information.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

    MEMORANDUM FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD WORKING GROUP MEMBERS

    FROM:          ELENA KAGAN
                   Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

    SUBJECT:       Next Steps

    Thank you for attending the first early childhood development working group meeting. The
    variety of activity taking place within each of your departments is exciting and encouraging. I
    am looking forward to working with you and learning more about your departments' efforts to
    support our nation's youngest children (ages 0-5, with a focus on 0-3). Attached please find a
    copy of the Presidential Memorandum that was formally sent to your department today.

    The next meeting of the working group will be held on Friday, February 28, from 1:30 - 2:30
    p.m. in Room 476 of the Old Executive Office Building. As discussed, please fax a preview of
    your agencies response to Jeanine Smartt at (202) 456-5581 by Wednesday, February 26. Please
    focus your preview on planned and proposed projects as we will concentrate on those activities
    during the next meeting.

    Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you.
