                                  THE WHITE HOUSE
                                   JANUARY 7, 1998

Acknowledgments: The First Lady, VP Gore, Mrs. Gore, Sec. Shalala, without her work and
commitment, we probably wouldn't be standing here today; Members of Cabinet; Members of
Congress.

        Throughout our history, our mission as a nation and as a people has been to honor and
live by our most cherished values. We have always risen to the challenge of applying those
enduring values to changing times, of keeping the American Dream alive for every person
willing to work for it. And always, always -- the heart of that dream and the backbone of our
society has been the family.

        Today, our new economy -- powered by rapidly advancing technologies -- has brought
unprecedented prosperity to our country. But the new economy has also imposed new demands
on working families. With more families relying on two incomes and working longer hours to
make ends meet, millions of children must spend at least part of their day in care away from their
parents. Too many parents find themselves walking a precarious tightrope between unstable
child care arrangements and the often uncompromising demands of work. For many families,
the search for affordable, high-quality child care has become a stubborn obstacle to achieving the
American Dream.

        No government can raise or love a child. Mothers and fathers do. But government can
provide parents the tools they need to meet this most vital responsibility. And government must
do what it can to empower Americans to be both good parents and good workers. So today, I
am proud to propose the single largest child care investment in the history of our nation. It is a
comprehensive and fiscally-responsible plan to make child care more affordable and accessible,
to raise the quality and assure the safety of care for millions of American families. This is an
issue that touches nearly every family in America, one that should rise above politics and partisan
interests. I welcome the bipartisan efforts to improve child care that are already taking place in
Congress and thank Senators Dodd, Specter and Hatch for their leadership.

        This proposal will be an important part of the balanced budget I send to Congress later
this month -- the first balanced budget in 30 years. The budget will build on the achievements
of the year just past -- one that was very good to working families. The historic balanced budget
agreement provided working families with a $500 per child tax credit, made college affordable
for every American, and expanded health insurance to five million uninsured children. We
successfully abandoned the false choices of the past and replaced them with a new economic
strategy. We proved that we could indeed balance the budget and invest in our people and the
future. And, from the Family and Medical Leave Act to the Earned Income Tax Credit, we
showed that it is not only possible, but crucial to the survival of the America Dream that we help



    our people meet their responsibilities to their children and fulfill their duties at work.
    Strengthening and improving child care have always been a part of our strategy. Since I took
    office, we have helped one million children and their families afford the child care they need.

            My new proposal has three fundamental goals. First, we must make child care more
    affordable and available to all Americans. In my balanced budget, we will double the number of
    children receiving child care subsidies to more than 2 million with increased block grants to
    states. This is the best step we can take to support welfare reform and keep working families
    from getting on welfare in the first place. We will also help three million more working families
    meet their child care expenses through a new child care tax credit. These tax credits will mean
    that a couple with two children, an income of $35,000, and high child care bills will no longer
    pay a penny in federal income tax. And, I am supporting tax credits to businesses who provide
    child care for their employees.

            Second, we must make sure that every child has a safe and enriching place to go after
    school. As the Vice-President said, too many children are left to fend for themselves in the
    hours between two and six o'clock. Too many children are roaming the streets, idling in front of
    the TV, and getting into trouble. That is why I am proposing the expansion of before- and
    after-school programs to help some 500,000 children say no to drugs and alcohol and crime and
    yes to reading, soccer, computers and preparing for the future. The Vice-President has worked
    very hard on this issue and I thank him for his leadership.

           Third, we must improve the safety and quality of child care and make sure that child care
    only advances our children's development. I am proposing the creation of an Early Learning
    Fund to help reduce child-to-staff ratios in child care centers, train child care workers, and
    educate parents We must also strengthen the enforcement of state codes and licensing
    requirements, weed out bad providers through tougher criminal background checks, and offer
    scholarships to talented caregivers.

            Let me take a minute to thank our state leaders -- from North Carolina to Washington,
    Rhode Island to Minnesota, for improving child care and promoting early learning across
    America. I know Governor Almond of Rhode Island is here and I thank him for making
    his state's Child Opportunity Zone program a national model.

            We are living in the most exciting era of human history. But even as time and
    technology continue to alter the way we live, work and do business, even as they make some jobs
    easier and render others obsolete, nothing can diminish the rewards and responsibilities of
    parenthood. No raise or promotion can ever top the joy of hugging a child after work. Nothing
    is more bittersweet than sending the child you once carried in your arms off to test her own wings
    in college. And nothing weighs more heavily on a parent's mind than the well-being of a child
    while he or she is in the care of others.

           There is no issue more important to America's families -- or to my own family. Hillary


                                                    2
first-hand -- as the child of a single mother. When my mother had to go back to school to get
the education she needed to support us, she was able to leave me in the care of my grandparents.
They loved and nurtured and protected and encouraged me. I was lucky. But we dare not leave
the fate of our children to chance. Every child is precious in God's sight, and should be precious
in ours as well. Every child should be just as loved, just as nurtured, just as protected, just as
encouraged -- regardless of whether that child's parents choose to go to school or go to work or
stay at home.

       Today, let us pledge ourselves to helping all parents do the best job they can at home and
at work. Let us pledge ourselves to providing all children the care, nurturing and education they
need to thrive in school and make the most of their potential. And let us all work to build a
future where all Americans who work hard and play by the rules can live the American Dream.
