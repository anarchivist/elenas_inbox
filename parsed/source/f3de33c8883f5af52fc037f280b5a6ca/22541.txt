    TEXT:
    I'm looking for the home for our proposed privacy legislation:   DPC? NEC
    ? According to Thursday's Washington Post, some states have been selling
    drivers license photographs to a private company that wants to build a
    "national database of photos and personal information."   Not surprising,
    there's a strong reaction underway in South Carolina. Can we /should we
    be looking at this --or is it already under consideration ?
