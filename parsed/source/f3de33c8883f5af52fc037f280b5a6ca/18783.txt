TEXT:
Bill White of public liaison says that the scheduling request for the
President to sign the executive order on people with disabilities has been
tentatively OK'd for March 13, which is great. However, he was told it
was to be a very short Oval Office signing with no remarks, no more than
10 people, and no press. We are a bit concerned that this will prompt
complaints from the disability community that we aren't serious about it.
Being able to do it in the Roosevelt with a few press present for 5
minutes of remarks by him would convey a much better message.  Bill will
push on this, but it would be good if we could too.
