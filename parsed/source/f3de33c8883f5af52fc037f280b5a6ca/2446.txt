TEXT:
John Lozier of Healthcare for the Homeless, who has worked with Mrs. Gore

in the past, called today to let us know that a group of homeless advocacy

organizations will hold a press conference tomorrow on the occasion of the

10th anniversary of the McKinney Act to call for more action to address

homeless issues and a White House commission on the homeless.     He didn't

think we should be concerned about anything but just wanted to reach out.
