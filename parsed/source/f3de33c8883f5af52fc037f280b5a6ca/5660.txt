 Learning on Demand: This $50 million initiative would sponsor pilots to
deliver
"anytime, anywhere" learning opportunities to adults using technology such
as the Internet, CD-ROM, and interactive TV.   It will be particularly
helpful for adults who
find it difficult to participate in classroom-based instruction -- e.g.
those who are disabled, those with family demands, those who are
frequently on travel, or those in rural areas. This will allow us to
partner with institutions such as Governor Romer's
western Governors University.

Last years initiatives:

Next Generation Internet You announced this initiative in your 1997 State
of
the Union. It will connect universities and national labs at speeds that
are 1,000
times faster than today's Internet. Last year, Congress approved $85
million out
of the $105 million request. This year, we will push for full funding and
Congressional
authorization.
