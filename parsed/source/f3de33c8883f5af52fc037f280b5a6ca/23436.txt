The 4th sentence in the attached statement has been revised slightly to
say "without such a commitment" rather than "without such legislation".

 THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary

Embargoed until 4:00pm Thursday April 1, 1999


STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

        Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is
publishing promising new results from the youth anti-smoking program
launched by the late Florida Governor Lawton Chiles.  The study shows that
in just one year, smoking has declined by 19 percent among middle school
students and by 8 percent among high schoolers.  These results show why
every state should have a comprehensive program to reduce youth smoking
and why I oppose any legislation waiving the federal governmentD,s claim
to tobacco settlement funds without making a commitment from the states to
fund such efforts. without such a commitment, states wonD,t have to spend
a single penny of the $246 billion settlement to reduce youth smoking. We
must act now: every day, 3000 children become regular smokers and 1000
will have their lives cut short as a result.
