     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                           GENE SPERLING

     SUBJECT:              Auto Choice


     Overview

             The purpose of the memorandum is to provide you with information on auto-insurance
     reform and the "Auto Choice" legislation introduced last April by a bipartisan coalition of
     Members of Congress. Over the last several months, an NEC-DPC inter-agency working group
     has spent considerable time analyzing the Auto Choice proposal and reviewing other
     auto-insurance reform options. It is the strong view of the working group that the benefits of
     the various Auto Choice proposals considered do not justify the cost.

             Although proponents of Auto Choice claim that it will reduce insurance premiums by
     approximately $250 per year for the average driver, the working group found little evidence that
     no-fault insurance would lead to lower rates. For example, the three states that currently mandate
     insurance companies to offer no-fault insurance plans (New Jersey, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania)
     have some of the highest rates in the country and have not seen rates fall since no-fault was
     implemented. Our analysis also suggests that, with Auto Choice, bad drivers will benefit more
     than good drivers. In addition~ if Auto Choice does induce some reduction in premiums, some
     economists believe more people will have an incentive to use their cars, leading to more
     accidents for bad and good drivers, increased environmental degradation, and greater strain on
     our infrastructure.

     Background

            "No-fault" insurance plans allows policyholders to recover financial losses from their
     own insurance company, regardless offault while restricting their right to sue.

              Under current state-no-fault laws, motorists may sue for severe injuries and for pain and
     suffering only if the case meets certain conditions. These conditions, known as a "threshold,"
     relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms (a descriptive or verbal
     threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (a monetary threshold). Some laws also include
     the days of disability incurred as a result of the accident. The academic evidence shows that
     verbal thresholds have a significant effect on lowering insurance premiums but that monetary
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

thresholds can actually lead to higher premiums because people have an incentive to exaggerate
their medical bills so that they can sue for pain and suffering.

Proposals

        The working group has considered two options. The first is the Auto Choice legislation
introduced by Senators McConnell and Moynihan and Representative Armey. Under this
proposal, drivers in states that accept the new federal legislation have a choice between the
existing system in their state and a no-fault plan (called 'personal protection insurance' (PPI). A
driver who chooses the PPI option gets first-party coverage for economic damages (mostly
medical and lost wages), without regard to fault, the driver can sue or be sued for economic
damages above policy limits, but cannot sue or be sued for non-economic damages ('pain and
suffering'), except in cases involving drug or alcohol abuse. A driver who opts to stay in the
state's current tort system must purchase tort maintenance coverage (TMC) to cover accidents
with PPI drivers.

        The second proposal was developed by CEA to achieve the same ends as Auto Choice --
lower premiums -- but at less environmental and human cost. The CEA proposal would require
insurance companies to offer premiums on a per-mile basis. Per-mile premiums would be
charged based on an estimate of miles, with a rebate or surcharge issued every year after an
odometer reading. Odometers could be read at regular inspections or by firms under contract
with insurance companies. Insurance companies would compete in their per-mile premium,
subject to current regulations; premiums would consequently vary with region, driving record,
type of car, and safety features, much as premiums vary now.

Analysis

        There are a number of problems with all of these proposals. Perhaps most important,
none of the proposals guarantees that insurance companies will pass on savings to consumers.
There is little evidence that over the long-term consumers saved money in states that have
implemented no-fault systems compared to the period when no-fault was not mandated. In
addition, it is not clear why the Federal government should enter into a field that traditionally has
been the responsibility Of state governments.

        The McConnell-Armey Auto Choice legislation has additional adverse consequences.
For example, safe drivers who maintain their current coverage could see their premiums increase
because they will need to pay to cover their own losses incurred as a result of other driver's fault.
In addition, the resulting self-selection of bad drivers into PPI will exacerbate this problem. As
the premiums of drivers in the non-PPI system rise, more and more people will switch to PPI,
thus further raising premiums for the very safest drivers. The end result may be the virtual
elimination of any real choice between the two systems.

        The Per-Mile Premium option addresses this problem, but we believe that we could not
sustain support for it. While we would argue that the average premium for drivers would fall
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

under CEA's proposal, opponents would counter that we are "taxing" each mile that
middle-income families drive. They would also argue that monitoring miles is an example of
big government intervention into people's lives.

        Although Auto Choice has wide bipartisan support -- from Senator McConnell to Senator
Moynihan and from Grover Nyquist to Mike Dukakis -- trial lawyers, consumer groups, auto
safety groups, and environmentalists will oppose this legislation.

Recommendation

       There is unanimous agreement among the NEC-DPC interagency working group --
including the Office of White House Counsel, the Office of the Vice President, CEA, OMB,
Transpo~ation, and Treasury -- that you should oppose the McConnell-Armey Auto Choice bill.


        Assuming you agree, the remaining issue is when to announce your position. If we
announce our opposition now, we may encourage supporters to bring the legislation up so as to
to define our differences. By contrast, if we remain quiet, the legislation may die on its own. We
therefore believe that it would be best to hold off any statement on the bill for now. If Auto
Choice comes to the floor, you could oppose it in a speech or we could issue a Statement of
Administration Policy.

Decision

_ _ Oppose Auto Choice, But Do Not Announce Position Unless And Until Bill Comes To
    Floor (RECOMMENDED)
