TEXT:
Steve/Elena -- Have you had a chance to review the VA/DoD guidance
for implementing the veteran and active duty member exception? Any
comments?
All of you -- One question that was raised by INS is who is
responsible for referring questions about status to either VA or
DoD regional office -- the individual or the agency?
For example, the guidance says that if veteran status is claimed,
but the individual doesn't have his papers, refer to local VA
regional office to determine status -- is the responsibility on
the agency/office or individual to do so?
It seems to me that is our call to make and the agency/office
should be responsible.  Let me know what you think.
thanks
