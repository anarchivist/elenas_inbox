TEXT:
As you know, Mayor Guiliani is holding a conference on immigration today
and tomorrow in NYC.  There are about a dozen electeds there (both dems and
reps)--Mayors Rice, Helmke, Rendell, Riordan, Pinellas, and County
folks-Molina, Yaroslovsky, Burke, Hightower and Randy Johnson. The rest of
the conference is advocates and assorted others from NYC.

The goal of the conference is to have the electeds sign a statement of
principles on immigration on Ellis Island tomorrow.  The statement will
include: a paragraph about the value of immigrants to the US;  the need to
speed naturalization; the need to restore all the cuts to immigration
contained in the welfare law--with no distinction made in the document
between the elderly and the disabled; and it will stress the importance of
local statutes that forbide asking about immigration status when reporting
a crime, seeking health care, or enrolling a child in school. As you
know, Guiliani feels that both the immigration and welfare law pre-empts
these local statutes--and this is a part of his lawsuit.

In his remarks today Guiliani said that its unfair to have to chose
between the elderly and the disabled and he called for the restoration of
all the immigration cuts.

I hope to get my hand on this document tonight. Call if you have quesitons.
