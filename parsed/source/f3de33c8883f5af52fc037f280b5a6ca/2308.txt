TEXT:
Heard from DOJ.  They claim there's no way on earth this statute could be
read as overruling the EXPLICIT coverage of doctors under the FTCA that
Congress enacted last year, over the OBJECTIONS of DOJ and HHS (long
story). They also say there's no argument that anyone not a federal
employee and not covered by the special doctor statute (Fran thinks it
might also cover, e.g., EMTs) is covered by the FTCA, so this bill would
provide them additional protection.  In short, they would object to the
addition of HHS's proposed language, which, of course, HHS has not yet
sent over officially.

I think we wait to see if senior HHS people support sending the language.
If they do -- if we get it.officially -- then we have a conference call
with us, HHS and DOJ to try to resolve the problem.  But if I had to
guess, I don't think we're going to be adding anything.

Ellen
