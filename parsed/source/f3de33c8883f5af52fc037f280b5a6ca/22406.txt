Tax Credits to Modernize Schools for the 21st Century
January 21, 1999

Last year, the Congress funded the first year of the PresidentD,s
initiative to hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in the early
grades. This year, it is imperative that the Congress act on the
Administration proposal to help schools provide well-equipped classrooms
to accommodate smaller class sizes. The PresidentD,s FY2000 budget will
propose Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $25 billion in bonds
to build and renovate public schools. Two types of bonds are being
proposed: School Modernization Bonds ($22.4 billion) and Qualified Zone
Academy Bonds ($2.4 billion). The tax credits on these bonds will cost
the Treasury a total of $3.7 billion over 5 years.  School modernization
is an urgent national need:

A record 52.7 million children are enrolled in elementary and secondary
schools, and this number is expected to climb further to 54.3 million by
2008.

The average public school in America is 42 years old, according to new
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data released last week.
Nearly three-quarters of todayD,s schools were built before 1970,
primarily to accommodate the baby boom generation. A schoolD,s original
equipment, including the roof and electrical equipment, should be replaced
when schools are between 30 and 40 years old, and school buildings begin
rapid deterioration after 40 years.

The NCES report shows that 30 percent of all public schools are in the
"oldest condition"    built before 1970 and never renovated or renovated
before 1980.

The oldest   schools are also lagging behind other schools in the push to
connect to   the Internet. While almost 60 percent of schools built in
since 1985   were connected to the Internet in 1995, only 42 percent of
schools in   the oldest condition were connected to the Internet.

School Modernization Bonds
$22 billion in School Modernization Bonds will be available over two years
($11 billion in 2000 and $11 billion in 2001) for construction and
renovation of public school facilities.  Federal tax credits will pay the
interest on these bonds.

Half of the bonds ($11 billion) would be allocated to the 100-125 school
districts with the largest number of low-income children, in proportion to
their share of funds under the Federal "Title I" Basic Grant formula, to
provide assistance in accordance with each school districtD,s plan.

The other half of the bonds ($11 billion) would be allocated to States
according to the proportion of low-income children (Title I Basic Grant
funds), not counting the children in the school districts described above.

To qualify for these bonds, States, territories, and the eligible 100-125
school districts would submit to the Secretary of Education the following
information:   (1)  a comprehensive study of the construction and
renovation needs in the jurisdiction,   (2) a description of how the
jurisdiction will ensure that the bond funds are used for the purposes
intended by this proposal; and, for States only (3) a description of how
highest priority will be given to localities with greatest needs and how
special consideration will be given to rural and high-growth areas.

Qualified Zone Academy Bonds
This program, created by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, provides a tax
credit to pay interest on bonds for a variety of expenses (including
building renovation) related to certain public school-business
partnerships. The FY2000 Budget would expand these bonds to cover new
school construction.   In total, $2.4 billion in bonds ($1 billion in 2000
and $1.4 billion in 2001) would be allocated to States on the basis of
their respective populations of individuals with incomes below the poverty
line.

New Native American School Component
In addition to the $22 billion of School Modernization Bonds described
above, the proposal includes a new component for Native American schools.
The Secretary of Interior would allocate $400 million in School
Modernization Bonds ($200 million in 2000 and $200 million in 2001) to
tribes or tribal organizations for the construction and renovation of BIA
funded schools.
