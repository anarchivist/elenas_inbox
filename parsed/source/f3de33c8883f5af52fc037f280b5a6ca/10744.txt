TEXT:
Here's' the language David is going to take back to whomever:

Smoking has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars under Medicare
and other programs.  Tonight, I am announcing that the Department of
Justice is preparing to take the tobacco companies to court to recover the
costs to the treasury of tobacco-related illnesses.  The funds we recover
could be used to strengthen Medicare.
