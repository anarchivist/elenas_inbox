TEXT:
According to James Costello (DOJ) , they are preparing a memo for the AG's
review.  They expect to give the AG the memo at the end of' this week and
that she would want about 10 days to review the memo and the options.      I
stressed the importance of resolving this issue in light of the Urban
Institute study that will be released next week. I expect that James will
give us another update at the immigration meeting this morning at 11 am.
