'TEXT:
 Judy Winston's staff is going to call Harris Wofford/the Corporation to
 set up a time to talk about race and service. I will be included in any
 meeting. But the race staff (Michele Cavataio) is anxious to explore this
 and I don't think it's productive to try to stand in the way at this
 point.    She is even pushing to involve Gen. Powell and America's
 Promise, so I think it's safer for them to talk to the Corporation at this
 point.

I hear that 2 concepts for the Dec. race town hall are being presented to
the President this morning; not clear to me whether one of them is
service.  I hear the location is Akron.  I have not been able to identify
any loop to get myself into on this process. Even if the town hall is not
on service, I may argue that we announce the MLK Day grants and maybe the
Kindness/Justice curriculum that day, if the link isn't too strained.
