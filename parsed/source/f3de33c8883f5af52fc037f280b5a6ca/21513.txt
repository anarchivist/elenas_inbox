TEXT:
We've already given the press office our announcement from the Hate Crimes
Conference, the Q&A, and the Administration's accomplishments document.
Here are some additional updates:

1.    Based on the press reports detailing the facts, the Wyoming case
would clearly fall within the Administration's proposed federal
legislation according to Neil Kravitz in the Civil Rights Division at the
Department of Justice.   Under the existing federal hate crimes law,
however, this case would not be covered because sexual orientation is not
a protected class.

2.    As the result of the Hate Crimes Conference, the President
instructed the approximately 100 U.S. Attorney's offices to ·set up hate
crimes working groups that would work with the community to prevent and
prosecute hate crimes. The working group in Wyoming has been operational
since early this year.   Participants in the Wyoming working group include
the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, ATF, and the state division of
criminal investigations.    The Wyoming working group is working with the
local prosecutor on the case; however, it would be inappropriate to
comment on the specifics regarding this ongoing investigation.

3.    The 1997 FBI data on hate crimes will not be available until the end
of this month or the beginning of November.


Let us know if we can send this to the press office. Thanks, Mary
