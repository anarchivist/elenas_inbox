TEXT:
I thought it might be helpful for you all to know how we handled the
Mayors' Drug Summitt at the White House in the spring.  It may inform your
decision on how to handle the mayor's request for a White House Conference
on Public Education.

The conference was divided in~o two days.  Participants included the
mayors and they were asked to bring their police chiefs and prosecutors as
well. The first day, the US Conference of Mayors met at a hotel in town,
with a full agenda that included presentations by several members of the
cabinet. The goal was to work toward a national drug strategy document
that could be presented to the President the next day. Obviously, we
worked very closely with USCM on the draft presented to the mayors and
subsequent changes made to the draft throughout the day. On day two, the
mayors, chiefs, and prosecutors were invited the the White House for
breakfast and an informal conversation with POTUS. After an opening
program (POTUS, VPOTUS, Mayor Daley, and Mcaffrey) and breakfast, Daley
moderated, and the POTUS asked questions of the participants and responded
to questions. Daley presented the POTUS with their drug control
strategy.  It was a very successful event.

Press plan was pool at the top (where the mayors drug policy document was
presented), closed for the discussion, a stakeout, and lots of preplanned
regional press for the mayors.

Your goal for education may be different. However, this allowed us to
invite only the mayors, chiefs, and prosecutors and not other locals,
govs, members, advocates, etc. It was their conference, but we helped
shape the agenda. We got great press, and it took 90 minutes of POTUS
time.
