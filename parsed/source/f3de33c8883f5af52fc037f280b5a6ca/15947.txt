TEXT:
I spoke (off the record) with Joan Lombardi.  (Nicole, I called her when I
learned that HHS is coming to our meeting tomorrow with no specific ideas,
just priorities, and that they can't put anything on paper yet.)

Joan says that they met with the Secretary who agreed with their
priorities, which led Joan to believe that Mary would start developing
options.  She hasn't for two reasons.  First, she is completely
overwhelmed by reconciliation. Second, the Department is worried about
getting out in front of the budget process. However, they have to come up
with options for the budget by around July 9. Anyway, Joan says that we
just need to yell at HHS tomorrow and tell them we need specific options
within two weeks. Otherwise, they'.ll continue to drag their feet.  She
does think that we need to have tomorrow's meeting.
