TEXT:
This e-mail responds to your question regarding the feasibility of funding
an FCC/DOJ research project to look at the "rating system" and the issue
of violence in the media

We believe that NIJ could best assist FCC with this effort.   NIJ has the
authority to procure a wide-range of research assistance.   I know you are
concerned about FCC taking the lead on this project, however, it may be
desirable to request that NIJ provide funding for a grant and to have FCC
chair an interagency oversight committee for the grant or to participate
in some other way.  This avoids the need to transfer funding from DOJ to
FCC, something DOJ is sure to resist.  In terms of 1999 funding, we
suggest one of the two options listed below:

1. Ask NIJ to identify from $250,000 to $1 million from its base
resources, or

2. Reprogram funding from COPS to NIJ.   (DOJ is in the process of
preparing a COPS reprogramming to help law enforcement in Littletown,
Colorado)

Please let me know if you have additional questions.   We will let you know
if we can think of additional funding approaches.
