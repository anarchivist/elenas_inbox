TEXT:
This a.m. spoke with Marty Michaelson at Hogan & Hartson; represents ACE
and other higher ed orgs, plus individual higher ed institutions
(including lots of big-name schools like Harvard).  He had a couple of
suggestions on possible things that could be helpful re: supporting
diversity that were consistent with what Mike and I sent you but might add
some more texture to your memo, if it hasn't gone yet.  I'm off to
charters/reading mark-up, but here are a couple of quick notes on his
ideas:

1. Launch a low-key, non-big deal basis -- a small scale ED project to
summarize for POTUS the social science research that exists on ed value of
diversity. Thinks never has been done in the govt.   In their Piscataway
brief, they took a run at that (10,11 give you a copy).

 Impt. To encourage ed community to strengthen research, let people know
whatO,s going on, coord with whatO,s going on in private sector -- sign of
POTUS/exec branch interest, recognizing limits.

2. A visit, or meeting of POTUS with leaders from higher ed universe (not
big, not necc. Associations) maybe a dozen, thoughtful folks, possibly
including several foundation leaders (mellon/Bowen), to discuss the state
of play on preservation of diversity in higher ed, maybe preceded by a
briefing paper -- highered community could help.   Communicating to
community that POTUS is concerned -- putting out encouragement to higher
ed leadership at a difficult time for them.

Thinks it would be good to do this pre-Piscatawy decision (expected in
spring) .

Also, he noted this stat: between 2000-2010 -- 5 million more 18-24
year-olds -- 2.1 million will be Hispanic or black -- well over 40%. 1.4 M
Hispanic, rest black. Highly disproportionately low-income lor poorly
ed. Real issue is what to do about that pop.
