TEXT:
By the way, on Tuesday the President is taping the 5 minute video that
will precede his appearance at the big Summit event at Independence Hall.
He is supposed to speak about Goal 5 of the summit (an opportunity for
young people to serve) and what it has meant to him personally.  Cabinet
Affairs is talking to people from his past who can help jog his memory
about what to say.  So far their list is people who remember HIM serving
in some capacity. Don is looking at this carefully, so I think we're OK,
but let me know if you want to be involved or have ideas. A private
producer is putting the tape together, so we may not have a lot of control
over the final product.
