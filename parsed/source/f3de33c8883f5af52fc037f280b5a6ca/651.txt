TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: JANUARY 28, 1997

SUBJECT:   DAILY LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Today, Congressional Budget Office Director June OD,Neill testified on CBOD,s
Economic and Budget outlook.   (Please call our office at 5-4790 if you would
like a copy of the testimony.)    In her testimony, OD,Neill claimed that to
achieve solvency in ten years, Medicare growth must be cut by two-thirds, from
9 percent to 3.4 percent growth.   Senator Lautenberg reportedly criticized
CBOD,s pessimistic projections and expressed fear that cuts to reach a balanced
budget would consequentially be too severe.

The Senate Banking Committee reported the nomination of Andrew Cuomo as the new
HUD Secretary by a vote of 18 to O. Also today, the Full Senate Committee on
Appropriations met to discuss subcommittee membership, committee rules and
committee budget issues.

Director Raines will testify on the PresidentD,s Budget on the following dates,
before the following committees:
Friday, 2/7 Senate Budget Committee
Tuesday, 2/11 House Budget Committee
Wednesday, 2/26 Joint Economic committee


CONGRESS TODAY (1/28)

SENATE:
No Votes.  A group of Democratic Senators, including Senators Hollings,
Feinstein, and Reid, led by Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, introduced a
version of the balanced budget amendment that exempts the Social Security trust
funds from budget calculations. Members also made remarks on presidential
nominations, Bosnia and other matters.

CONGRESS THIS WEEK:

SENATE:
On Wednesday, beginning at 9:30 am, the Senate will debate the nomination of
Andrew Cuomo as secretary of Housing and Urban Development for 30 minutes, with
a vote is expected around 10:00 am.  The Senate may begin debate on William
Daley's nomination as Secretary of Commerce tomorrow, but will not hold a vote
