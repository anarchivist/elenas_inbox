TEXT:
Our list of ideas is light on science and technology ideas, which is
unfortunate, since this will be the last State of the Union of the
Milennium.   In addition to Chris's crusade against Superbug, we might
consider:  I} smart gun technology; 2} gun detectors; 3} more high-tech
wrinkles in our child support crackdown; 4} the next idea in education
technology; 5} an adoption registry; 6} cures for the various diseases
that will plague the globe once the new Milennium hits; etc.  We should
also think about some possible consumer-oriented responses to this
technological advance -- privacy protections, etc.

Anybody who comes up with a good high tech idea wins a free clock radio.
