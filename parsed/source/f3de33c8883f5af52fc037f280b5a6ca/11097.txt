TEXT:
Kneedler expressed doubts that HHS has less ability to require the States
in Medicaid to ensure beneficiaries' rights vis-a-vis HMOs than it does in
Medicare.  I talked to Harriet Rabb and Anna Kraus (her deputy?), who
basically confirmed his suspicions: HCFA regs do require State Medicaid
agencies to ensure beneficiaries procedural rights re decisions on
provision of services -- including appeals from HMO decions to the state
agency -- comparable to those in Medicare.    Rabb and Kraus say only real
difference between Medicare and Medicaid is that there are already one or
two court decisions saying Medicaid HMOs are state actors, but none as to
Medicare HMOs.
