TEXT:
Attached are possible agenda or discussion topics dealing with immigration
issues that the DPC may wish to consider when reconvening the Immigration
Core Group.  I talked with other OMB staff members in generating this
list.  If you.have any questions or need additional information, please
let me know.

Immigration Benefits

Coordinate the development of immigrant benefit eligibility definitions.
This issue is of particular concern for immigrant support groups who
believe that individual agencies are developing definitions without
central guidance and are not accurately reflecting the Administration's
position regarding eligibility. These groups are primarily concerned with
how the Administration will define "federal public benefit" under the
welfare bill and "public charge" under the immigration reform bill.

Monitor the implementation stages of INS Naturalization Reengineering
initiative. INS has completed its study phase and plans to begin
implementing a redesigned naturalization process.  Monthly status reports
by INS on the success of the implementation phases of this initiative may
ensure it stays on track.



Legal immigration policy -- both temporary and permanent -- probably in
consultation with NSC.  Legal immigration issues keep cropping up in
different contexts, (i.e., elimination of the 10K unskilled workers visas,
expanding the H-1B program, agricultural guestworkers). DPC lead of
efforts to coordinate interagency thinking on these policy issues prior to
a short turn-around crisis would be beneficial.

Immigration Organization

DPC leadership of the implementation of the INS restructuring should be
exerted once the budget is released.  The DPC should track the
implementation of the INS restructuring and actively engage INS and the
Department during the implementation process to ensure it adheres to the
policies laid out in the Budget.  INS should report regularly on the
status of the reorganization and the DPC should further develop and press
the Department on the interagency recommendations dealing with better
coordination/delegation of similar INS functions.  In particular, DPC
should follow-up with Department or Labor and State recommendations
dealing with:

    shared or delegated responsibility for worksite enforcement activities
between INS and the Department of Labor.  This is something DOL has
indicated interest in pursuing and INS has told us that such a delegation
can be accomplished without a change in legislation.

-- improving the coordination of visa processes between State and INS.
Duplication and lack of coordination between INS and State's Bureau of
Consular Affairs formed the foundation of the Commission on Immigration
Reform's recommendation to move the benefit/service operations to the
Department of State.  Clearly this is an area that should get a higher
level of attention to ensure improvements/reforms are
implemented.

Immigration Enforcement

The immigration reform bill requires INS to develop a departure management
system that tracks inbound and outbound passengers.  Such a system has
tremendous logistical, staffing, technology implications and policy
implications which will affect a number of Federal agencies and
neighboring countries. Currently, INS is moving to implement an extensive
departure management system at air and land ports of entry.  The
Administration is seeking legislation to extend the deadline for the
implementation of such a system. The immigration working group may be the
appropriate forum to debate the proper "system" the Administration will
support.

The issue of health care coverage for aliens apprehended along the border
is a concern of the State of California.  DOJ, OMB and INS have worked on
this issue but a solution has not yet been agreed upon.  DPC could bring
this issue to resolution.
