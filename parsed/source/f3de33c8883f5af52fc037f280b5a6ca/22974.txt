TEXT:
The EEOC is planning on making two announcements tomorrow:

1.   An approximately $3 million settlement on equal pay where registered
nurses from the Phillipines were not being paid like other registered
nurses but rather were being paid as LPN's.

2.   Also, the EEOC is going to provide guidance to employers on what is a
"reasonable accommodations" under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
