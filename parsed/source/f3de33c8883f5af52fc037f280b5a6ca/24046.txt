TEXT:
Colleagues:

A friend of mine from the Hill told me Dingell, Stupack, and Barcia had a
pro-gun amendment meeting today.  Seems they're agreed on offering 2
amendments: (1) to limit gun show checks to 24 hours; and (2) to drop the
ban on imported clips and replace it w/increased penalties for violating
the ban on clips.

Interesting, eh?
