TEXT:
i'm not sure which memo you read by now, but in very short
summary, here's where we are:
o        WH press office confirmed, in response to reporters'
questions, that draft EIS was not going forward at this time and
there were concerns with scientific analysis;
o        after considerable internal debate, USDA and FS have
developed and united around a proposal to establish a
FACA-chartered scientific committee to analyze science coming out
of Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project report and make recommendations
on EIS;
o        there is a draft directive embodying the above that will be
presented to Sec. Glickman tommorow am (Tues.). I haven't seen it
yet.
o        CEQ and other WH offices are hoping the
directive/announcement today to answer continuing questions.
