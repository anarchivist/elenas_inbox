TEXT:
Apparently yesterday afternoon was the first of weekly budget
reconciliation meetings run by Raines with WH and agency people (they will
normally be Friday at 4:00). According to Tarplin, who was there, Jack
Lew proposed and others agreed to send a Raines letter to Ways and Means
before the Friday subco~mittee markup stating our administration
position. Agencies are supposed to get paragraphs to OMB tomorrow.

Bruce and I had never heard about this meeting had been scheduled. Was
anyone else invited? When we went up to the Hill, all the agency folks
knew about it since most of them had been there.  Yikes.
