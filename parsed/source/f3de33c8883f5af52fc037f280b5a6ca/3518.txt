TEXT:
When I spoke with Leslie Thornton at ED to get info on the CA and TX
investigations, she said she felt that the response the POTUS used in
Chicago when he got asked about the California admissions situation could
be strengthened; in particular, she suggested that in the future he should
make reference to a draft report that a UC outreach task force has
released for public comment, and encourage folks to get involved in
helping to shape the plan. Reading the transcript, I tend to agree that
we might want to suggest a somewhat different approach.   Do you agree
that this is something that needs more work, and if so, do you have any
suggestions for a process? A memo? Suggested talking points for his next
press event? Or something else? Thanks.
