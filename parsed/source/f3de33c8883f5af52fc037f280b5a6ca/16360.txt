Subject:         Needle Exchange Q & A


I am concerned that our current Q & A on needle exchange 'is obsolete.The
question the President is most likely to be asked is as follows:


Q: What does the Administration plan to do about lifting the ban on
federal funding of needle exchange programs?

 A: We firmly believe that we must do everything possible to address the
twin epidemics of HIV and substance abuse. We have overwhelming evidence
that needle exchange programs reduce the rate of HIV transmision. However,
there is still considerable discussion with regard to their impact on drug
use. Until we can make the case that these programs do not encourage drug
use our chances are marginal, at best, of overting a negative
Congressional backlash. We do not want to find ourselves in a worse
position on this issue than where we started. We are continuing to work
with Congress, the research community, and AIDS advocacy groups to protect
ther waiver authority of Secretary Shalala to decide this issue on the
basis of public health.

Let me know what you think.
