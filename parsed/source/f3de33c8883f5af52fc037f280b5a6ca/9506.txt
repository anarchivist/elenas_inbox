TEXT:
I have had fruitless discussions with Treasury about doing an event on
EFT'99. Michael Barr, the DAS for Community Empowerment at Treasury
agrees we should do and event, unfortunately no one else at Treas4ry
does. I talked with their Chief of Staff Michael Froman about this
personally, and Froman advised me the consensus among the Secretary,
UnderSecretary Hawke, and others is that it would be dangerous to do an
event because the AARP is still concerned about how EFT '99 will affect
the elderly who prefer "paper checks." Sylvia Mathews seems to concur
with that opinion. Barr tells me however, that AARP is no longer at odds
with EFT, '99 because of the generous waivers provisions in the final
regulations that allow ,the elderly to'opt out of the program and continue
receiving paper checks.

    you noticed on television a'public service announcement from Treasury
    advising people that EFT '99 was going into effect. It does seem
    contradict'ory and I pointed this out to Barr. 'He was' going to try one
    last time to push ,this up the ladder, but he has not had any success.
