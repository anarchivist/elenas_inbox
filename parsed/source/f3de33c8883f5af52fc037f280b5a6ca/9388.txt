There are OMB staff comments on the Chiles proposal.  Neither Josh nor Dan
has reviewed, since they are both away for the holiday.

any specific legislation.

Chiles Medicaid Tobacco Recovery Idea

Under current law if the states recover Medicaid costs as part of a tobacco suit, they are required
to pay back federal Medicaid matching payments.

CBO would score any legislation that forgives the states liability as a cost ($1.2B over 5 years).

The $1.2B represents CBO's estimated amount of federal recoveries, less certain administrative
costs (e.g., lawyers fees). Moreover, the federal amount is adjusted downward by CBO because
states wil.l assert that the tobacco recoveries are not based on the Medicaid smoking costs and
because CBO regularly "discounts" the HHS Secretary's resolve in collecting from the states.
[The fact that states are willing to offset the $1.2B may indicate that the estimate of the federal
share is too loW.]

Given that CBO would score a cost of $1.2B over 5 years, the idea is for the states to offset the
costs by paying back the government. Each state would pay according to the percentage of the
national tobacco recoveries it received. That is, if Florida accounts for 30% of all tobacco
recoveries, it would pay 30% ($360m) of the $1.2B to the federal government.

Concerns

There are several concerns with this idea, they have been organized into three categories:
definition; budget/scoring; and enforcement.

Definiton The development of national tobacco legislation involves clearly identifying the basis
of the settlement payments (e.g., real versus nominal dollars; inflation factors in the outyears);
etc.}. The basis of the payment would have to be clarified.

Budget/Scoring As a matter of precedent, OMB resists accepting CBO scoring in law because it
is inconsistent with the President's economic assumptions, baseline technical assumptions, and
scoring assumptions. Consequently, OMB may score the costs of forgiving state payments
differently than CBO.

To implement the law, we believe the proponents of the idea are thinking of writing the dollar
amount in law. Given that estimates vary over time, drafting legislation that locks in a dollar
figure can have unintended outcomes. For example, Medicare beneficiaries are supposed to pay
25% of Part B costs. At one point dollar amounts, rather than the percentage, were written into
law. When Medicare actual expenditures came in lower than estimated expenditures,
beneficiaries were paying more than 25% of Part B costs.

Enforcement Obviously, OMB staff would not recommend forgiving states.

                                                              Automated Records Management System

be enforced. Under what circumstances would the states be compelled to make these payments?
 If a state's economy performed poorly, could the states simply choose not to pay the federal
government? Is it likely that all states will agree to this idea, or is Florida an exceptional case? If
the cost offorgiving the recovery is $1.2B and the states are willing to pay this cost, why not
simply collect the federal share of the recoveries?

The most rational mechanism for enforcement, assuming one accepts the estimated dollar
recoveries, is to take the amounts out of federal payments to the states for Medicaid. This
assures that the federal government gets its share of recoveries.

However, if one enforces this policy through Medicaid, it is not clear how this idea di ffers from
current law. Under current law, the Secretary is directed to recover from state Medicaid grants
the federal share of amounts recovered by the states from' the tobacco companies for Medicaid
costs related smoking.
