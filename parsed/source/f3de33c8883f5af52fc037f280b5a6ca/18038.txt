Pediatric Labeling. This week, The New York Times reported that the pharmaceutical industry
has raised ethical concerns about the Administration' pediatric labeling regulations. Specifically,
the article reported that the industry was claiming that clinical trials required would unnecessarily
expose children to inappropriate, and potentially harmful, doses of medication. This story,
which primarily focused on the potential costs to pharmaceutical companies, did not back up its
headlines with any substantive example. Nor did it suggest any concerns that the industry had
not raised previously when you released the regulation in August. The article failed to mention
that the regulation allows the FDA Commissioner to waive testing requirements for any trial that
provides unacceptable health risks to children. Moreover, the American Association of
Pediatrics and other consumer advocates immediately responded to this article by emphasizing
the need for this regulation. They pointed out that it was unethical not to have this regulation
and it exposed all the nation's children to medications that physicians have inadequate
information about. As to the industry's concern about costs, it is also important to note that the
FDA reform bill you recently signed into law contained a provision that would compensate
companies for this testing through the six month extension of market exclusivity for these drugs.
 These facts may help explain why there was no media followup to this story.

Tobacco/Medicaid Testimony. On Monday HCFA's Nancy-Ann Min DeParie is testifying before
the House Commerce Subcommittee on Health on the issue of Federal recoupment of the
Medicaid portion of any state's tobacco settlement agreement. In her testimony, Nancy-Ann will
praise states for their successful lawsuits against the tobacco industry and the settlements they have
obtained. She will also point out how the Federal government, through the FDA, strengthened
the hands of states in filing their suits in the first place. Her testimony has been designed avoid
being confrontational but to simply state that the current statue but does not give significant
leeway with regard to recapturing overpayments. It will also reiterate our longstanding public
position that it is our hope and expectation that the FederaljState allocation issue will be resolved
in through a Federal legislative solution on this subject.

Medicaid AIDS Demonstration. Late this week, The Washington Post and The New York Times
reported that the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that an AIDS
Medicaid demonstration would be extremely expensive and certainly would not meet the normal
budget neutrality waiver requirement. This spring, the Vice President requested that HHS look
into the feasibility of demonstration program to allow AIDS patients to become eligible for
Medicaid much earlier so they could access to promising therapies earlier when they are thought
to be more effective, helpi~g keep people with HIV healthier and more able to work. This
request raised expectations in the AIDS community. However, it was learned through
subsequent analysis that this program could cost well over $8 billion and would certainly violate
the Administration's budget neutrality rule for Medicaid demonstrations. The AIDS community
was briefed on this problem and was generally accepting that the costs of such a demonstration
would be significant. Notwithstanding the Post's suggestion that we are abandoning this
concept altogether, we have currently requested that HCFA develop a legislative Medicaid
demonstration proposal that would cap the costs yet still provide some earlier access to these
Administration's actions closely, particularly with regard to the FY 1999 budget and will push
for your continued support for AIDS research and treatment. We are preparing options for
your consideration, both through Medicaid and the discretionary budget.
