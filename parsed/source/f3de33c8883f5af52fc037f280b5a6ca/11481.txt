TEXT:
I attended a civil Rights Coordinating Council meeting today that was
chaired by Maria and Chuck Ruff.  It was attended by Ben Johnson, Sylvia
Matthews,  Chris Edley, Minyon Moore, Eddie Correia, Lisa Brown and
others.

The purpose of this council is to set the President's civil rights
priorities for the remainder of the term.   At a prior meeting with
various Agency civil rights officials, they were asked to draft memos that
described their civil rights priorities.

During the meeting today, we discussed how we should prepare for the
upcoming meeting with agency officials on Thursday and the way we should
proceed to develop the priorities .. After much discussion of the agency'
memos, we decided to develop areas of civil rights priorities and to ask
the agencies to continue vigor enforcement of existing civil rights laws,
to implement current initiatives and to expand on current initiatives
and/or develop new initiatives that agencies have already identified.

The priorities identified fall into these two general areas
enforcement/ specific programs and long-term goals.

10 issues areas were identified:

1. Race based admissions in education - defend race-based admissions/
diversity in education

2.   K-12 (resource equity/disparate resources)   -issue guidance on


disparate resources among school districts associated with race or
national origin.

3. Hate Crimes-to develop a nat'l strategy & enact the Hate Crime
Prevention Act

4.   CRA/Lending   - preserve CRA and eliminate discrimination in lending

5. Worker Exploitation - enact legislation and enforce current laws on
worker exploitation

6.   wage gap - reduce the wage disparity between men and women

7.  Language rights - this issue needs more info from the agencies but
this would involve EEOC enforcement and possibly bilingual ed

8.  EEOC backlog- we need to put our federal house in order by reduce the
backlog of claim.

9.   Diversity in the work force - promote diversity in the federal
government

10. Enforcement of the Environmental Justice Executive Order - need to
take action to follow up on this EO (reports from agencies, etc.).

The issues of police brutality and race profiling have been set aside from
this discussions since it's on separate track.

On Thursday, 3/4 a meeting with the agency officials has been scheduled
to discuss these priorities.    For each of these issues, an agency will
identified as the lead, they will be asked to report of their progress, to
make recommendations as to the White House's role on these priorities and
to identify the areas that need additional resources.

I will continue to update on this council and various priorities areas.
Please let me know if you have any questions.

                                 Irene
