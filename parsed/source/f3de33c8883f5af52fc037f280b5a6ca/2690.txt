TEXT:
I suggest looking at historical/cultural ideas for possible policy/action
items.  Sylvia mentioned the Slavery Museum. I also have been saving a
wire service story about bipartisan legislation to preserve the
Underground Railway, sponsored by Carol Mosely-Braun and Mike DeWine in
the Senate, Rob Portman and Lou Stokes in the House. (Plus Gingrich.)
