 TEXT:
 I was talking with Anne Lewis, NEC, this morning about the differences
 between Texas and Wisconsin.  I thought that you might be interested in a
 better description of Wisconsin.   A quick and dirty summary is that
 Wisconsin focuses more on privatization as a mechanism to improve program
 performance while Texas' approach is more focuses on improving cost
 effectiveness. Although each State is striving towards both goals.

 This description has been added to the agency paper.

 Wisconsin Works

 The Wisconsin Works (W-2) demonstration proposal is a Statewide project
 which, in part, would establish competitively-bid County contracts with
 public or private agencies.  The public or private agencies would be
 responsible for certification actions such as gathering client eligibility
 information, conducting eligibility interviews and imputing data for those
 food stamp households which are subject to W-2 requirements.  The
 contracted agencies would not have any responsibility over the StatesD,
 computer system.

 There are 72 counties and 11 Indian Tribal Organizations (ITO) in
 Wisconsin.  In 61 counties, the County Social or Human Services Department
 earned and exercised its right of first selection to administer the W-2
 project. Two ITOs also earned the exercised the right of first selection.
 Therefore, competitively-bid contracts will be awarded for the W-2 project
 in 11 counties and 9 ITOs.  However, the State could, at some point in the
 future, contract with a private agency for the W-2 project in a County offi
 ce that does not meet a specified level of performance.

 Private organizations that are awarded contracts may perform aspects of


     the certification process that are currently required to be handled by
     merit employees.   The'W-2 employees would be responsible for food stamp
     households that are subject to work requirements.   Food stamp households
     that are exempt from W-2 requirements, such as the elderly and disabled,
     will continue to be certified by public employees.

     The State, presuming the Department of Agriculture's approval of its
     waiver request of the merit system requirements for the Food Stamp
     Program, released its Request for Proposals (RFP).  While the State can
     issue the RFP without USDAO,s approval, they will need to hear back from
     USDA in order to award the contract. State officials have advised that
     the contract process has been completed for one County (with over 60
     percent of the State caseload) without the inclusion of the Food Stamp
     Program. Contracts have been awarded to six private, non-profit agencies.
