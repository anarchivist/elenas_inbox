TEXT:
The Department of Education proposes to include the insert below in its
draft letter to conferees on HR 6 that was circulated earlier today (LRM
CJB 260).  Please respond specifically on this proposed insert by the
deadline for reviewing the letter (4:00 p.m., tomorrow, Thursday, July
30th). Thanks.

"I strongly support the goal of the Senate provision on Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) of enabling more welfare recipients to
move from welfare to work.  I look forward to working with conferees to
ensure that the final legislation keeps the doors to college open to all
Americans while still maintaining the welfare law's strong work
requirements."
