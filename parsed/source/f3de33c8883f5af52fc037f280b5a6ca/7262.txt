TEXT:
As you all are aware Speaker Gingrich is holding a counter-drug bash the
administration, launch a Republican "agenda" on Apri~ 30th (next Thursday) .

One of the items on the Speaker's legislative agenda is a "Drug-Free
Professional and Olympic Athlete Responsibility Resolution"

The Administration should get out in front on this. ONDCP has been
preparing a drugs and Olympics announcement deliverable for the UN Special
Session in June.  However, next week the President is meeting with the US
Nagano team on Wednesday the 29th, and the Vice President is speaking to
the Olympic Gala that same night.  Both of these are prime opportunities
to get ahead of the curve with a simple Presidential or Vice Presidential
call to close the Olympic drug loophole.

Moreover, we can show this as part of real agenda. ONDCP last month
launched an "Athletics Initiative," which has already begun wotking the
drugs and Olympics" issue.  We have a full compliment of real deliverables
set for the coming months -- including NCAA events, a "Coachathon" and
efforts to help the NBA close its drug loopholes.  So we have a real
agenda here to back this announcement -- far more than a mere feel good
resolution.

Would welcome the chance to discuss the mechanisms and options.
 (Attached is a concept for the UN, which provides background)

                              UNGASS OLYMPICS DELIVERABLE

UNGASS Background: This June, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a Special Session on
efforts to fight drugs. A number of heads of state have already committed to attending. The President
has indicated he will try to attend; no final word on his participation has been made.

OlympicslDrugs Deliverable: President should announce a commitment to a "drug free Olympics," to
both preserve the values that embody the Olympic movement and to send the right message to the
world's children. This commitment should be backed by a US commitment to lead on this issue.

OlympicslDrugs Background: Until the Nagano Games, general consensus was that all drugs were
banned among Olympic athletes. The gold medal snowboarder who tested positive for marijuana caused
this question to be brought before the international Court of Arbitration for Sport, which decided that
present Olympic drug ban rules apply only to "performance enhancing drugs." This decision effectively
sanctions the use of illicit drugs, such as marijuana and heroin, which arguably do not help, and in fact
may hinder actual performance.

There should be widespread support, including within the International Olympic Committee, to close this
loophole. The Chairman of the IOC's counter-drug efforts has stated the loophole will close by the
Sydney Games.

The USOC represents the US at the IOC. The USOC has the most stringent rules and testing program
for our athletes -- beyond what IOC rules require. Preliminary indications are that the USOC will
support extending the ban and would work to help close the loophole (Director McCaffrey is meeting
with the USOC President in April to nail this down).

Top 10 Reasons Why POTUS Should Do This:
(1)   It's a no brainer -- People want the Olympics to embody the best of sports -- parents don't want
      their kids looking up to drug users on Olympic podiums, heralded as heros.
(2)   It's cost free -- no federal monies required; USOC already has tougher standards.
(3)   It's both tough and feel good -- rule oriented/get tough, but with a message to kids focus.
(4)   HIGH visibility -- can even bump up with an Olympic star (e.g., Lipinsky) joining POTUS on the
      Delegation at UN.
(5)   Ramp up and amplification are easy -- if WHO wants, we can do a great kids, sports/drug-free
      event in an NYC park with athletes, USOC leaders, coaches, perhaps even IOC; Pre, POTUS is
      set to meet US team, and VPOTUS speaks at Gala in April.
(6)   Substantively backed -- Proposal would make a real difference, and ONDCP Director is working
      the athletics and drugs issues hard; this is more than a soundbite.
(7)   People care about the Olympics, surveys show people care about drug use -- real "two-for -one."
(8)   Success will resonate for two years with the Salt Lake Games -- 2 years from now people/media
      will rehash the effort/commitment.
(9)   Imagery is great -- World leader, at the UN, talking about fixing a fantastic institution of peace
      and goodwill; the remarks could be fantastic and soaring; strong set up for POTUS in Salt Lake.
(10) Because it's the right thing to do.
