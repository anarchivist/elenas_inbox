 Subject:         Meeting with Foundation Executives

 Richard,
  On Thursday, December 18; 1-4pm, {NEOB, Room 10103, lOth Floor) ,Judy and
 PIR staff will be meeting with an informal group of 13 Foundation
 executives ( Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, etc.) who are funders of new
 and innovative race relations initiatives/activities. The purpose of
 their funding activities is: 1) to identify leaders in various sectors who
 have developed promising practices, and, 2) to have an impact on the
 national conversation on race, with emphasis on the dialogue aimed at
 problem solving. The Foundation Group is very interested in how we can
 work together.

 As we discussed, Judy would like to invite White House staff to join us in
 the discussion.    Please extend an invitation to appropriate White House
 staff and copy me on the note. The agenda and a list of foundation
 participants will be forwarded to you under separate cover. Thanks
 Audrey
