TEXT:
FYI, I just got back from speaking to about 150 small and medium size
employers who are attending the annual National Employer Council meeting.
I spoke to them about ways business· can become involved in the welfare to
work effort.

Employers raised a major impediment to hiring welfare recipients (and
school to work participants) that hasn't really come up before:  workers
compo

While large corporations can afford increased workers comp rates that
result from brining on new workers, most small and mid-size corporations
cannot.   Essentially, when a new worker joins the workforce, whether as a
volunteer, a trainee, a subsidized worker or a full time employee, the
employer's workers comp rate will go up for each worker.   If the worker is
at more risk than others of being hurt on the job (those without work
histories, those with substance abuse prOblems, etc.) the rate goes up
even more.   If a worker is actually hurt on the job, the company is held
liable even if the employee is not on the pay roll, and the rate goes up
more.

Most of these employers want to hire welfare recipients but cannot afford
to take the risk because of workers comp and say the work subsidy and/or
the tax credit do not offset that risk.

Bruce/Elena--Is there a way to help small and mid-size companies get
around this workers comp issue?
