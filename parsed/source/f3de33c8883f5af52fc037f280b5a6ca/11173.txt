                              Hamilton v. Accu-Tek Decision
                                   February 11, 1999


Q:   What is your response to the jury decision last night awarding $3.7 million in
     damages to victims of New-York area shootings? Do you support the decision?
     Do you support the lawsuits being filed by New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta and other
     cities?

A:   The Justice Department is currently reviewing last night's decision involving the gun
     manufacturers (Hamilton v. Accu-Tek), and we won't be in a position to comment on the
     specifics of that case until they've completed their review.

     However, the President is watching closely all of the pending lawsuits against the gun
     industry. He is especially concerned about allegations -- such as in the Chicago lawsuit
     -- that some gun dealers are selling guns illegally, helping purchasers evade firearms
     laws, and even selling guns to persons who say they intend to break the law. These are
     serious charges which, if proven true, would demonstrate that some parts of the gun
     industry are helping to promote an illegal market in firearms. Such disrespect for the law
     endangers our citizens and will not be tolerated. So, ifin any of these cases, the
     evidence demonstrates that federal firearms laws have been violated, we will, of course,
     vigorously enforce the law.

     In the meantime, the Administration will continue to work closely with state and local
     law enforcement to trace crime guns back to their source, to prevent illegal gun sales --
     especially to criminals and juveniles -- and to pass even tougher gun laws.

                                   Question and Answer
                                    February 12, 1999


Q.   What is your response to reports that the Immigration and Naturalization Service
     (INS) is considering a plan to release criminal aliens -- including drug offenders and
     alien smugglers -- into the community because of lack of detention space?

A.   INS will not be releasing any criminal aliens due to lack of detention space. While the
     Administration has dramatically increased both deportations and detention space, recent
     changes in the law have significantly increased the number of people that INS must
     detain. These changes have had serious impacts on INS detention space. Moreover, last
     year, the Congress underfunded the Administration's detention and deportation funding
     request by $80 million. So in the short term, we may need to reprogram funds, and we
     intend to seek additional emergency funding from the Congress to immediately increase
     INS detention space. In addition, the INS will continue to review a variety oflong-term
     options to meet their responsibilities on detention-- all of which will keep public safety as
     the first priority.
