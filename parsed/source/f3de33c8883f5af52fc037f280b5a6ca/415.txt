TEXT:
John M just faxed over the HHS responses to the outstanding
questions from the intergovernmental groups.
These would be the basis for the meeting on Wednesday.  I will get
these around first thing on Tuesday.  Can we do a quick review and
collect comments by 5:00 Tuesday?
Ken: they have apparently included something on waivers and cost
neutrality that we may want them to take out. Do you want to
regroup by phone based on staff discussions these past couple of
days to see what we say on Wednesday?
Elena: anything to be said yet on means tested? What time frame
can we publicly say we'll have an answer?
Ken: on the circulars/apportionment question, are we ready to give
an answer yet?
