TEXT:
Wanted to pass along a message from Phyllis Greenberger re the
Product Liability veto.
Phyllis is Executive Director of the Society for the Advancement
of Women's Health Research and is also a member of the President's
AIDS Advisory Council. She is a friend of the administration's
and of the First Lady.
She wanted to stress that it would not be a good idea for the
President to highlight the breast implant issue as part of the
veto ceremony - i.e., not have one of the people with the
President tell that particular story.
I don't know whether this is good or bad advice since I am not
involved in the issue, but I did want to pass it along to you
folks who I assume are putting the event together.
Marilyn: I suggested that Phyllis call you directly to discuss.
