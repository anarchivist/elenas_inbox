TEXT:
This group is ready to announce a new project, with federal help, that
will train 200,000 youth by the year 2000 to be "community leaders" who
fight drug abuse in their communities. ONDCP has been working on it.     It
seems like a natural for us to announce as a summit commitment . . Ricia
McMahon says it is ready to go but I need to double check.  I will send
you a copy of their writeup on this.

Dennis/Leanne:   have you heard of this?
