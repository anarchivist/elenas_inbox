TEXT:
The LAT article points up a dangerous shifting of the debate.  It seems
that Downey and ultimately Waxman are stoking it. Myers says in terms of
keeping his groups in line, Koop is the most important validator. He     '
suggests we reach out to Koop (who he says is not informed about things)
and keep him in the loop and that would solve a lot of the problems.
