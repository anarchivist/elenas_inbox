According to Conrad's press person, (Tom Mahr isn't in) they have the
following Senators confirmed to attend:
        Daschle
        Conrad
        Bingaman
        Durbin
        Kennedy
        Lautenberg
        Leahy
        Reed
        and Fazio
        Waxman

They're trying to find out how many others have signed on as cosponsors.
I told him that we are concerned that the numbers are much lower than we
originally thought.
