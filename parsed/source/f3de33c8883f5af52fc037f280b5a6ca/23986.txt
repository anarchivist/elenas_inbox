TEXT:
There are at least two articles in the papers today about the Census no
longer compiling marriage and divorce statistics.  Isn't this a problem
for us? I would think we would want to do something to make sure they
continue to collect those stats.  Stories were in either the NYT or the
Post, and there was one in USA Today.
