 9   follows:

IO        " (a)        FINDINGS.    The Congress finds that-

11                II   (1)    as Nations of the world become increasingly

12   interdependent and as international communication becomes a

13   daily occurrence in government, business,               commerce, and

14   family life, multilingual skills constitute an important

15   national resource that deserves protection and development;

16                "(2)        the presence of language-minority Americans

17   is related to Federal immigration policies;

18                "(3)        language-minority Americans speak virtually

19   all languages, including many that are indigenous to the

20   United States;

21                "(4)       many language-minority Americans are

22   limited in their English proficiency, and many have limited

23   education and income;

24                "(5)        there are large and growing numbers of
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

     children and youth of limited English proficiency, many of

 2   whom have a cultural heritage that differs from that of

 3   their English proficient peers;

 4               "(6)    limited English proficient students and

 5   their families are increasingly moving into school

 6   districts that do not have appropriate services in place to

 7   serve them;

 8               "(7)    limited English proficient students arrive

 9   at their schools at various age levels and often with

10   tittle or no prior formal schooling;

11               "(8)    limited English proficient children and

12   youth face a number of challenges in receiving an education

13   that will enable them to participate fully in American

14   society,   including--

15                      "(A)   segregated education programs;

16                      "(B)   disproportionate and improper

17   placement in special education and other special programs,

18   due to the use of inappropriate evaluation procedures;

19                      "(C)   disproportionate attendance in high-

20   poverty schools, as demonstrated by the fact that,           in 1994,

21   75 percent of limited English proficient students attended

22   schools in which at least half of all students were

23   eligible for free or reduced-price meals;

24                      "(D)   the limited English proficiency of



                                       2
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
     their parents, which hinders parents' ability to

 2   participate fully in the education of their childreni and

 3                       "(E)   a shortage of teachers and other staff

 4   who are professionally trained and qualified to serve such

 5   children and youthi

 6               "(9)     school districts and schools find it

 7   challenging to include limited English proficient students

 8   in their reform effortsi

 9               "(10)     a 1999 National Center for Education

10   Statistics survey found that teachers are less likely to

11   participate in professional development designed to address

12   the needs of limited English proficient students than to

13   take part in any other kind of professional development

14   activitYi

15               "(11)     institutions of higher education can

16   assist in preparing teachers, administrators, and other

17   school personnel to understand and build upon the

18   educational strengths and needs of language-minority and

19   culturally diverse student enrollmentsi

20               "(12)     high-quality bilingual education programs

21   enable children and youth to learn English and meet high

22   academic standardsi

23               "(13)     a 1998 National Research Council report,

     Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children, found

 2   that limited English proficient students should be taught

 3   to read first in their native language and that, if such an

 4   approach is not possible due to lack of materials and

 5   resources, limited English proficient students should

 6   attain some fluency in oral English.before they receive

 7   formal reading instruction in English;

 8             " (14)     the use of a child's or youth's native

 9   language and culture in classroom instruction can--

10                      "(A)   promote self-esteem and contribute to

11   academic achievement and learning English by limited

12   English proficient children and youth;

14   proficient in English and also participate in such

15   programs; and

16                      "(C)   develop our Nation's national language

17   resources, thus promoting our Nation's competitiveness in

18   the global economy;

19             " (15)     research, evaluation, and data-collection

20   capabilities in the field of bilingual education need to be

21   strengthened so that educators and other staff can better

22   identify and promote      programs, program implementation

23   strategies, and instructional practices that result in

24   effective education of limited English proficient children;

 5   for improving the education of language-minority and

 6   limited English proficient students and their families,            and

 7   the Federal Government should foster development of that

 8   technology;

10   title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and section 204 (f)

11   of the Equal Education Opportunities Act of 1974, has a
