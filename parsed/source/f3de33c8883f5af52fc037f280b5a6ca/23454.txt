TEXT:
OMB spoke to the director 'of scheduling at the Federal Register who said
pulling the rule was not impossible.   The longer we wait the harder it is,
so they can't offer us any guarantees without knowing our timing.   Don
Arbuckle will be glad to calIon behalf of the President to push when and
if we need him to.  (Don is out of town so I did not speak to him
personally, but this is what he told his staff person when he called in.)
