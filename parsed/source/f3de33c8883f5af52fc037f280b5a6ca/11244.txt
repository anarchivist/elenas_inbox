Draft 2/18/99 3:20pm
Lowell Weiss
PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS FOR NAACP 90TH ANNIVERSARY RECEPTION
WASHINGTON, DC
February 19, 1999

        Acknowledge: Chairman Julian Bond; former Chair Myrlie Evers-Williams;
Pres. and CEO Kweisi Mfume; Vice Chairman Bishop William Graves; Bell
Atlantic Foundation President Suzanne Dubose; Sec. Herman; Sec. Slater;
Sec. West; Sen. Sarbanes; Rep. Gregory Meeks; Ben Johnson. Most of you
here know Ben, but for those of you who donD,t, ID,d like to take this
opportunity to introduce him. After serving as my Deputy Director of
Public Liaison, Ben has agreed to take on a vital new role as the first
director of the new White House Office on the PresidentD,s Initiative for
One America. Ben told his wife that he should have had this job at 35,
not 54 -- and I know just how he feels.  But both of us are going to have
to work like weD,re young again -- because if weO,re going to achieve that
elusive One America, weD,ve got much more work to do.

        Ninety years ago, as you well know, the NAACP was founded in
direct response to a hateful riot in Springfield, Illinois.  I had always
thought that it was a cruel coincidence that the riot took place in the
very city Lincoln had been laid to rest.  Only recently did I learn that
it was not a coincidence at all.  That angry white mob was trying to make
Lincoln spin in his grave.  As they rampaged through black neighborhoods,
they were screaming, D&Lincoln freed you, weD,11 show you where you
belong!DB

        In the decades that followed, the NAACP showed precisely where
African-Americans -- and all Americans -- belong:   In voting booths. At
lunch counters.   In any seat on any city bus.  In integrated schools and
armed forces.   In any -- and I mean any -- office in our land.  In a
beloved community where all our childrenD,s talents are matched by their
opportunities.

        For 90 years, the NAACP has advanced not only the righteous march
of people with color.  The NAACP has advanced our entire nation toward the
more perfect union of our foundersD, dreams.

        Today, we are blessed with the greatest opportunity in decades to
speed that advance. Communities are growing safer and families growing
stronger. We have opened the doors of college to every high school
student willing to work hard. WeD,re enjoying the longest peacetime
expansion in history. And this expansion is inclusive, not exclusive.
The African-American poverty and unemployment rates are the lowest ever.
Wages are rising at twice the rate of inflation.  This is true
prosperity.  It is shared prosperity. But there is much more to do on
every front.

        A few hours ago, I granted a posthumous pardon to Lt. Henry Flipper, who
was wrongly convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer more than a century
ago.  Lt. Flipper, who was born a slave, became the first African-American
West Point graduate and served with great distinction in the 10th


Cavalry.  In 1881, his commanding officer brought charges against him for
failing to account properly for some commissary funds.  I formally
pardoned him because I believe Lt. Flipper was convicted for no reason
other than the color of his skin.

        I was very glad I had the opportunity to right a wrong from the
past. But the tragedy is, there are still so many wrongs being committed
today. Some are savage wrongs, like the murder of James Byrd in Jasper,
Texas. Others are pernicious everyday wrongs: African-American families
too often turned away from home loans, African-American drivers too often
pulled over for the phantom crime of O&driving while black,OS
African-American children too often stuck in dangerous, failing schools.
The long journey to end discrimination and division is far from over.

        That is why, in 1997, I launched our Initiative on Race -- and why
I have tapped Ben Johnson to continue this vital work.  It is also why, in
my new balanced budget, I have greatly increased the resources to help
close the large opportunity gaps that remain: The great disparities in
education ... in jobs and economic development ... in civil rights
enforcement ... in home-ownership ... in quality health care.

        Now, weO;re here to celebrate your history and future tonight, not
to talk policy.  But I canO,t resist diving into a least one policy area
-- the education gap.  For as Kweisi has said, O&education has always been
our bridge over troubled water.OS

        There are a lot of good things going on in our schools.  But what
does it say to you that our children rank at the top of the world on 4th
grade math and science tests, drop to the middle in 8th grade, and fall
near the bottom by 12th grade? It tells me that the system is failing our
children, not the other way around.  It tells me that it is time to hold
states and schools accountable for results.

         First, we want to work with states and schools districts to end
the counter-productive practice of social promotion.   WeO,re intent on
helping them do it the right way -- not by holding more children back, but
by lifting more children up, with greatly expanded after-school programs,
smaller class sizes, more modern schools, and better teachers.   IO,m
particularly proud that my balanced budget dramatically increases college
scholarships for young people who commit to teach in high-poverty areas.

        We will insist that school districts turn around -- or close down
   their worst-performing schools, and my balanced budget contains $200
million to help schools do it. We will also insist that they expand
public school choice, adopt sensible discipline policies, and raise
standards for teachers.  The sad fact is, most of the teachers who donO,t
have college majors or minors in the subjects they teach are in schools
with the highest poverty rates.

        You have lent your heart and soul to the cause of educational
opportunity for 90 years.  Today, we need your help more than ever.
America can no longer tolerate schools that deny disadvantaged children
the opportunity to learn their way out of poverty. And, of course, we
need your help to close all the other opportunity gaps I mentioned. We
need you to continue to lend your years of wisdom and success to these
vital tasks.

        As we approach the end of the 20th Century, people are speculating
about the great advances we will make in the 21st. Our scientists, for
example, believe that within our lifetimes children will know cancer only
·
    as a constellation of stars. But I am confident that the miracles of the
    next century will emerge not only from brilliant laboratories but also
    from the kind of grass-roots work the NAACP is doing every day.  Miracles
    like a world-class education for every child. Safe communities and
    quality health care for every family. Discrimination finally purged not
    only from our books but from our national soul. And if anyone doubts that
    we can do these things, I say: Look how far the NAACP has advanced our
    nation in less than a century.  For you -- more than any other
    organization in history -- have showed us that if we aim high, there is no
    limit on what we can achieve. Thank you for your struggle and sacrifice
    these past 90 years and God bless you all.
