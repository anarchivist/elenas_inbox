PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON LONG-TERM CARE TAX CREDIT
DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
February 18, 1999

        Acknowledgments: Gov. Shaheen; Beth Dixon; Karen Goddard; David Robar;
other panelists TK

         I want to thank the Governor for her remarks, and I especially
want to thank her for all sheD,s doing to improve the quality and
availability of health care here in New Hampshire.   I think her proposals
are good ones. And I think they will go a long way toward helping the
people of New Hampshire meet the challenges of health care in the 21st
Century.

        Today, our panelists will discuss a number of these challenges:
from the rights of patients to the concerns of small businesses providing
coverage; and from the health care needs of children to those of the


elderly and people with disabilities. My administration has been working
for six years now to make progress in all these areas; and my latest
balanced budget renews that commitment. We remain focused on the future.
And that is why I want to talk this morning about meeting the greatest
challenge of the new century: the aging of America. As the Baby Boom
becomes the Senior Boom, long-term care will become a growing need.  So it
is more important than ever that we help families provide that essential
kind of care for their loved ones.  In my balanced budget, I have proposed
and paid for a long-term care tax credit of $1,000 to help families do
exactly that.

        I will have more to say about that proposal in a moment.   But
first, let me put it into a larger picture, and say that a long-term care
tax cut i"s exactly the kind of tax cut we should be making. As you know,
we are engaged in a great national debate right now about how to use the
budget surplus. Now, we can all agree that America should have tax cuts.
But there are two very different ways we can go about it. First, there is
the old way -- failed and full of risk -- that some Republicans are trying
to resurrect.   They are saying:  splurge today, save tomorrow. ThatD,s
not the approach that Vice President Gore and I have proposed.   Our
approach says invest today, save for tomorrow.   Our kind of tax cut is one
that doesnD,t destroy our fiscal.discipline, but preserves it.   Our kind
of tax cut is not indiscriminate, but is, instead, targeted to meet
peopleD,s real needs for the future. Above all, our kind of tax cut
allows us to meet our responsibility to future generations -- and to
invest the lionD,s share of the surplus in saving Social Security and
Medicare first.

        Even some Republican moderates are coming to see the wisdom in
this approach, in targeted tax cuts.  I look forward to working with them
to make the right choices for future generations -- to make sure we donD,t
squander our historic opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare,
and pay down the debt. As I said in my State of the Union Address one
month ago, we can make good on that opportunity -- while providing tax
relief like USA Accounts, and while making targeted tax cuts in areas from
urban investment to clean energy technology, and from child care to
long-term care. That is the way we should use our surplus: We should
invest it.  Invest it in AmericaD,s future.

          AS I have said:   In the future, in the 21st Century, America will
  be an aging nation. And as the ranks of the elderly grow, so do the
  numbers of vulnerable Americans who cannot fend for themselves.   Already,
  millions of households are caring for elderly relatives and neighbors and
  people with disabilities.   It is the cycle of life.  Our parents worked
  and saved and sacrificed for us in our youth; adult children are working
  and saving and sacrificing for their parents in old age.
          Providing long-term care at home is, more and more often, a common
  choice, but it is rarely an easy one.   Since this kind of care is rarely
. covered by private insurance or Medicare, out-of-pocket expenses can be
  high. Moreover, caregivers who hold jobs outside the home -- and that is
  a vast majority -- may have to take unpaid leave or work fewer hours to
  fulfill all their responsibilities.

        We have taken steps to ease the burdens on these families in a
number of ways: by strengthening Medicare, by extending the trust fund, by
promoting prevention and improving nursing homes.   But the aging of
America in the 21st Century will demand more of us.   And so the long-term
care tax cut I have proposed last month is another way to ease the burden
that caregivers bear.  It would help to meet the unique needs of
individual families, empowering them to do what is best, showing them how


very much we value the work they do.  And it is only one part of our
comprehensive long-term care initiative:  I have also proposed a national
Caregiver Support Program, as well as new steps to help Medicaid pay for
home- and community-based care. Caregiving is a vital and sacred compact
among generations -- and one we should recognize and reward as a nation.

        There is more we must do to improve health care in America. We
should also join together across party lines to pass a- strong, enforceable
PatientsD, Bill of Rights -- as well as the landmark legislation proposed
by Senators Kennedy, Jeffords, Roth, and Moynihan to allow people with
disabilities to keep their health insurance when they go to work. We must
keep working to help small businesses insure their employees, since it is
the smallest companies that often have the greatest difficulty in
providing coverage. And we must keep working until our uninsured kids
have the coverage they need and deserve.  In 1997, we passed the largest
investment in childrenD,s health in a generation, helping extend coverage
to up to 5 million children; and now, in states across the country,
Governors like Jeanne Shaheen are working to implement their programs.   In
this way, we are all working together to build a stronger and healthier
America for the 21st Century.

        I know our panelists have some important perspectives to share.     I
am looking forward to starting that discussion.

        [The President asks the panelists a question TK.]
