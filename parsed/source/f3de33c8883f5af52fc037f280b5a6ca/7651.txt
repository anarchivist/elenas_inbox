FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      MAY 14, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

Senate 302(b) Allocations:  Senate Appropriations Committee approved
tentative FY99 302b allocations.   The allocations represent an increase of
$4.6 billion in BA, but a drop ,of $3.1 billion in outlays, compared with
current spending. Chairman Stevens plans to mark up four appropriations
bills the week after Memorial Day, with three more the. following week. The
allocation is based on the Senate-passed budget resolution which provides
for roughly a 1 percent increase in budget authority above FY98 for
defense (roughly the PresidentO,s request) and NOD programs (roughly 9b
in BA below the gross request).   While no documents are available it is
understood that the allocation provides for a freeze or slight cut for
most nondefense bills, while providing resources to the Treasury/Postal Su
bcomm. to fund new courthouse construction, to the Energy & Water subcomm.
to fund continuations of unrequested Corps projects, and roughly $lb to
Labor-HHS to help fund the increase for NIH.    Transportation is expected
to get only enough funding to fund surface transportation programs at the
0+98 level (leaving it to ISTEA to fund the increases).             ..

Budget Resolution: Kasich is still planning a markup of the budget
resolution next week, date to.be determined.

Republicans oppo·sing Kasich budget plan: Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich) said
today that House Republican moderates oppose the level of spending cuts in
the Kasich plan and have 40-50 members who would vote against the plan.
At the same time, from the conservative wing, Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind)
said about 25 members of the Conservative Action Team oppose the Kasich
plan because the tax cuts are too small and defense spending is too low.
Kasich has responded by saying he would go to markup with numbers only,
i.e., without making programmatic assumptions.

Tobacco: Senate Finance Committee today amended the McCain bill by
adopting (10-9) a Conrad amendment to raise the price of cigarettes by
$1.50 over three years; the tax would then be tied to inflation. The
Senate is expected to have a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the
McCain bill on Monday.   Majority Whip Nickles opposes the $1.50 and will
offer a substitute on the Senate Floor.

ISTEA: Negotiations over ISTEA continue.  In expectation of closure, the
House Republican leadership has tentatively scheduled floor action for
next week.
