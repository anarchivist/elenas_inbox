Esteemed Crime Colleagues:

Bert at Justice called me a bit earlier to say that the Supreme Court will
be announcing some decisions Monday at lOam.  Brady may -- or may not
be on the list.  perhaps we should prepare for a Monday fire drill
particularly since I'm out of practice.  Should we prepare a draft
statement over the tonight or -- gasp! -- over the weekend?

Jose'
