      TEXT:
      The deadline for pillars and memos is tomorrow Tuesday, August 26 by noon


      please forward 25 copies of your pillar and 'one copy of the memo to me in
      room 164 OEOB.

      Again, please make the deadline, as it will greatly help Wednesday's
      meeting generally (and your pillar specifically) if the participants have
      the afternoon and evening to review the materials.
      Thank you.
