          FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSABOUT
                                     THE
               NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND
              YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT

     1. What is the bill designed to achieve?
     The bill is designed to stop children from taking up smoking. Every
day, tpree thousand
     kids begin smoking. One thousand of them will die early from
smoking-related
     diseases. The Centers for Disease Control reports that Tobacco use
among American
     youths is on the rise.

     Na'tionally, smoking-related illnesses kill over 400,000 people a
year, and costs
     taxpayers over $45 billion annually in medical costs.

     Experts indicate only a comprehensive approach including a ban on
advertising appeals
     to children, hiking the price of cigarettes and providing FDA
authority to oversee the
     industry will stop what public health officials call a Apediatric ep
idemic.

     The bill passed by the Senate Commerce Committee by an overwhelming
majority,
     19-1, is intended to achieve these goals, while protecting retailers
and farmers.

      2. How can I get a copy of the bill as reported by the Senate Commerce
      Committee?
      The bill will be available on the Library of Congress's THOMAS Server
 after being
      introduced on the Senate Floor.

     3. When is the full Senate expected to consider the bill?
     Tobacco legislation is expected to be considered by the full Senate
by June 1, 1998.
     The goal is to have a bill approved by both the House of
Representatives and the
     Senate, which can be sent to the President and signed into law before
the end of 1998.


       4. With Senate action around the bend, who would be the best person I
 can
      voice my opinion to about this measure?
      Interested citizens should contact their Senators and Representatives
 to share their
      views on tobacco legislation or any other measure before Congress.


      5. What is the House of Representatives going to do about tobacco
 legislation?

     The leadership of the House of Representatives agrees that Congress
must move
     forward on the issue of kids smoking this year, but have not said


officially how and
     under what time line tobacco legislation will be considered.


     6. The bill appears to be unconstitutional, in violation of the 1st
and 14th
     Amendments.
     Last year the tobacco industry said they would sign protocols
agreeing not to engage in
     certain forms of advertising as part of a global tobacco settlement,
particularly with
     respect to children. Legal experts agree that the industry has every
right under the
     Constitution to curtail its own activities, including commercial
speech.

     If the industry does not agree, Congress constitutionally can take
action, though not as
     broad as last year's agreement, to curtail advertising aimed at
children.


     7. The price per pack of cigarettes will increase. Isn't the price
increase a tax?
     Who will have to pay the increase?
     Consumers of tobacco products will pay for increases in the price per
pack of
     cigarettes. Whether it is called a settlement payment, a franchise
fee or a tax, the reality
     is the industry and consumers will pay more. That is part of the cost
of stopping kids
     from smoking and for reimbursing the tens of billions of taxpayers'
dollars expended to
     treat victims of smoking related disease.


     8. Why did Republicans vote for this measure?
     Republicans and Democrats alike voted for this measure because
stopping kids from
     smoking is a national, not a partisan, imperative; Documents released
in Court and to
     Congress indicate that the industry has long known the harmful and
addictive nature of
     tobacco, and yet actively worked to hook kids early--even though
doing so would kill
     one-third of them.


     9. Isn't this a get-rich scheme for the politicians and lawyers?
     No, the bill is a comprehensive plan developed in a bi-partisan
fashion with the help
     with public health experts, including Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr.
David Kessler, and
     the administration to solve a serious national problem. If we do
nothing, kids will
     continue to get hooked in greater numbers, and the yearly death toll
and health care
     costs will continue to skyrocket.


     10. If enacted into law, how will the following be affected?

     A. Tobacco industry? According, to the Department of Treasury, the
price increases
     requested by public health and the President, and included in the
Commerce
     Committee bill will not bankrupt any company. volumes of tobacco
consumption will
     drop with decreases in underage usage but, cigarettes will remain
legal and smoking a
     choice to be made by adults.

     B. Tobacco farmers? The bill contains legislation drafted by tobacco
state Senators
     to provide comprehensive assistance to farmers and' rural communities.
Congress is
     committed to ensuring that innocent, hardworking American farmers and
tobacco
     dependent rural communities will receive the support and assistance
they need.

      C. vending machine owners/operators? The Committee believes the
tobacco
      vending machine companies and employees should be compensated if
their industry is
      adversely by a tobacco settlement. The tobacco bill passed by the
Commerce
      committee would create a non-profit corporation that includes tobacco
vending
      machine industry representatives, to provide payments to vending
machine companies.
      The amount of compensation provided to individual vending companies
would be
      determined by this non-profit Board. The vending machine industry
strongly supported
      this proposal and urged the Committee to include the provision in the
bill.

     D. Indian tribes? The bill ensures that tobacco taxes will be
collected on Indian lands
     so that disparate pricing of tobacco products does not create a youth
access problem.
     This will be accomplished in a manner that protects tribal soverei
gnty and the federal
     trust relationship.

     E. Veterans? The bill includes an amendment by Senator Rockefeller
granting the
     Department of Veterans Affairs the right to sue on behalf of veterans
for tobacco
     related compensation.

     How revenues derived from the settlement will be divided, including
for veterans health
     care, is an issue that will be dealt with by the full Senate.


     11. Aren't the tobacco companies being treated unfairly?
     No. But, unfortunately, the tobacco companies have treated the nation
unfairly by


     targeting kids in their marketing. As a result, we have a serious
public health problem
     that must be answered with tough legislation.

     12. If the tobacco industry goes bankrupt, won't it have an adverse
effect on
     the U.S. economy?
     The goal of this legislation is not to put any company out of
business. The Department
     of Treasury says the bill will not have that effect. If bankruptcy is
a real threat, rather
     than walk away from the table, the industry should make their case to
the
     administration.
