TEXT:
EK:

As follow-up to the last race meeting, we should pull together a meeting
with Janet Yellin to discuss compiling stats and info for race.  Edley and
I weren't able to do so after the meeting, and he suggested this
afternoon, but I forgot about it until now.  I thought it would be most
appropriate for you to talk to Janet first, but I'll put in the call if
you want.  Perhaps -- instead of having a seperate meeting -- we should
just do it before or after the next race meeting (?). Also, I'll talk to
Justice about the most appropriate BJS person.
