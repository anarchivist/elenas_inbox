Subject:         meeting on hill's approach to technicals

FYI, Mary Bourdette and Rich T want to meet this Friday because HHS is
testifying next Thursday before the Ways and Means subcommittee on the
technicals package. The main need for preparation is that the hill is
creating its own technicals package and so we have to be ready to respond
to questions on items we may have rejected, new ideas, etc.

HHS says they will have paper that we can go over at the meeting.  Janet
Forsgren says perhaps we should get the paper first, but I think maybe we
should just get together.
