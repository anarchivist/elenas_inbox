     Subject: Consumer Financial Event

     Since Rep. LaFalce is traveling over the recess, Legislative Affairs
     strongly recommends postponing the Consumer Financial Event until Congress
     returns to Washington the week of April 12.  LaFalce very much wants to be
     here when we have this event, and would be upset if we went ahead without
     him.  In any case, the event would be more effective if we wait until
     Members are back in town and able to attend.
