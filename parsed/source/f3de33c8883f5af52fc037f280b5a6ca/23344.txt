TEXT:
In follow-up to the public charge meeting, I think we made some good
headway in preclearing the public charge NPRM and guidance with the
agencies.

In follow up to Dan Chenok 's suggestion that INS establish a review
mechanism if an Legal Permanent Resident (LPR) who was formerly a refugee
is found to be inadmissible upon returning to the US,  Barbara call me to
explain that there are already mechanisms in place to ensure that LPRs are
not deported before there is a thorough review of all the circumstances.
She indicated there are 3 steps already in place.   When a LPR is found
inadmissible, they are put in deportation proceedings which is triggered
by filing a Notice to Appear. This notice (1) must be signed off by a


supervisor and (2) reviewed by district counselO,s office; (3) and finally
the LPR would be in deportation proceedings so they would have the
opportunity to make their case before an immigration judge. During this
period, the LPR is not in detention nor is this a case of expedited
removal.    The LPR would have a full opportunity to make their case to a
judge.

In effort to get this reg out, I suggest that we not push this further.   I
spoke with HHS and they are okay with this approach but are anxious to
review the NPRM and guidance.

please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
