TEXT:
There will be a Senate vote tomorrow on the motion to proceed on cloture
on the Child Custody Protection Act. The D's are expected to support the
motion. Once it passes, the D's will try to offer a number of very
hard-hitting amendments (ie. miminum wage), hopefully forcing the R's to
drop consideration of the bill.

That is the strategy for now ....
