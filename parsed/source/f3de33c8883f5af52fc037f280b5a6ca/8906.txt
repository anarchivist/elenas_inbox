                   PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
              REMARKS TO THE WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE
    BUILDING ECONOMIC SELF-DETERMINATION IN INDIAN COMMUNITIES
                         WASHINGTON, D.C.
                           AUGUST 6, 1998

      Acknowledgments: Lynn Cutler, the 15 federal agencies co-sponsoring this event with
the White House.

         In a little more than 500 days, America will celebrate the arrival of a new millennium. I
have called upon all Americans to do their part to strengthen our nation for the 21 st Century. I
believe our Native American communities -- whose ancient cultures have shaped the history of
our still very young nation -- have important roles to play in the America ofthe next millennium.

        For most Americans, our understanding of Native Americans is frozen in time -- in
sepia-toned photographs of legendary chieftains; in the ancient names of rivers, lakes and
mountain ranges; in the chapters of old history books. But as we have seen at this conference,
the two million members of our Tribal Nations -- from energetic young entrepreneurs such as
Dominic, to innovative leaders like the ones sitting behind me -- are a vital part of America today
and have the potential to become an even more vital part of America's future.

        We are living in a time of great hope and possibility. Our economy is the strongest in a
generation. We will soon have the first balanced budget and surplus in thirty years. Our social
problems are finally bending to our efforts -- crime and welfare are the lowest in a generation.
We are taking great steps toward the America I envisioned when I first ran for president six years
ago -- an America that provides opportunity for all, that demands responsibility from all, that
lives as a community of all. It is a time of unprecedented prosperity for some of our tribal
nations as well. Gaming and a variety of innovative enterprises have enabled tribes to free their
people from lives of poverty and dependence. The new wealth is sparking a cultural renaissance
across Indian Country as tribes build new community centers and museums, language schools
and elder care centers.

        But we also know that on far too many reservations across America, such glowing news
means very little. While some tribes have found new success in our new economy, too many
more remain caught in a cycle of poverty, unemployment and disease. The statistics have
become all-too-familiar: More than a third of all Native Americans live in poverty. While
unemployment is at a 28-year low all across America, on some reservations, 80 percent of all
adults still do not have regular work. Diabetes in Indian Country has reached epidemic
proportions, other preventable diseases, and a1cholism continue to diminish the quality of life for
hundreds of thousands.

        In this time of great prosperity, these statistics are unacceptable. That is why we are here
today -- to find new ways to empower our people -- especially our children -- with the tools and
the opportunity to build brighter futures for themselves and their families. The federal
government alone cannot solve the problems of Indian Country. Nor can the tribal governments

or individuals be left to fend for themselves. Instead, all of us must take responsibility -- and
work together.

       As president, I have worked hard to honor tribal sovereignty and strengthen our
government-to-government relationships. Long ago, your ancestors gave up land, water and
mineral rights in exchange for peace, security, health care and education from the federal
government. It is a pact that is as solemn and unforsakeable as our Constitution. And while the
United States government did not live up to its side of the bargain in the past, we can and must
honor it today and into the next millennium.

         Four years ago, when I became the first president since James Monroe to invite the
leaders of every tribe to the White House, I issued a memorandum directing all federal agencies
to consult with the Indian Tribes before making decisions on matters that affect their people.
This spring, I strengthened this directive so that the decisions made by the federal government
regarding Indian country are always made in cooperation with the tribes. And in the last six
months, Jackie Johnson has joined the staff at HUD, Carrie Billy at Education, and Rhonda
Whiting at the Small Business Administration to help coordinate and promote Native American
initiatives at these agencies. Finally, Raynell Morris will join the White House Office of
Intergovernmental Affairs to help Mickey Ibarra and Lynn Cutler with Native American
initiatives and outreach. I welcome all of them to my administration.

        Today, I'd like to talk about three tools of opportunity that everyAmerican must have to
thrive in the 21 st Century -- and how we can work together to bring these tools to every person in
every comer of Indian Country -- from Pine Ridge, South Dakota to Window Rock, New Mexico
to Pembroke, North Carolina.

        The first and most important tool of opportunity is education. Throughout our history,
education has been the key to a better life for generations of Americans. This will be even more
true in a global economy that will reward only those children with the skills to take advantage of
the growing number of high-paying, high-tech jobs. Today, fewer than two-thirds of Native
Americans over the age of25 hold high school degrees; fewer than 9 percent go on to college. If
this trend continues, then the future for Native American children will become even bleaker; the
opportunity gap between them and their peers will widen into a dangerous chasm in the
Information Age. That is why later today, I will sign an executive order directing my
administration to work together with local officials to improve Native American achievement in
reading and math; raise high school and post-secondary graduation rates; reduce the influence of
poverty and substance abuse on student performance; create safe, drug-free schools; and expand
the use of science and technology.

         The second tool is high-quality health care. Native American communities will never
reach their full potential if their people continue to be hobbled by disease -- diseases that are
often preventable and easily treatable. Last summer, I signed legislation that strengthens
research, prevention and treatment of diabetes in our Native American communities. Earlier this
year, I launched an initiative to eliminate health disparities in infant mortality, immunizations,
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer screening and management, and HIV/ AIDS between
racial and ethnic minority groups by the year 2010. Today, I am proud to announce an
adjustment in our new Children's Health Insurance Program to ensure that eligible Native
American children can get the health coverage and care they need.


                                                 2
                                                               Automlll'ld Records Management System
                                                                       hex-Dump gonversion
           And I am proud to announce my support for Secretary Shalala's proposal to promote of
    the Director ofthe Indian Health Service, Dr. Ernest Trujillo, to the rank of Assistant Secretary.
    By elevating the head of the Indian Health Service, we can ensure that the health needs of our
    Native Americans get the full consideration they deserve when it comes to setting the health
    policy of this country.

             The third tool is economic opportunity in the form of jobs, credit, and small businesses.
    Too few grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, banks are doing business on reservations. As a
    result, 85 cents of every dollar earned by Native Americans -- money that could be used to build
    tribal economies and create jobs -- is spent off-reservation. I have issued a new directive to
    boost economic development on our reservations. The directive will do three things: First, no
    tribe will be able to attract new businesses ifit doesn't have the phone, fax, Internet and other
    technology capabilities essential to commerce in the 21 st Century. So I am asking the
    Department of Commerce to work with Interior and the tribal governments to study and develop
    a plan to meet the technology infrastructure needs of Indian Country. Second, I am calling on
    several agencies to coordinate and strengthen all of our existing Native American economic
    development initiatives. Third, I am directing the Departments Treasury and HUD to create
    one-stop mortgage shopping centers on reservations that will help more Native Americans obtain
    loans more easily. A pilot program will soon go up in the Navajo Nation.

          Finally, I am proud to announce a plan by the USDA to help seven tribes get a foothold in
    our high-tech economy. The department will help these tribes establish small technology
    companies to provide the software development and other technological services that are in high
    demand across America.

            I believe the next millennium can be a time of great progress and prosperity for our
    Native American communities. Today's American Indian population is still very young. In the
    last Census, thirty-nine percent of all Native Americans were under the age of 20. It is a statistic
    that should bring us great hope -- even as it poses our greatest challenge. We have a new, large
    generation of young people, who, if given the tools, the encouragement and the opportunity, can
    work together to lead their people out of the stifling poverty and despair of the past. Let us all
    work to bring these newest descendents of our oldest Americans a new millennium where all
    America's tribes will have vanquished poverty and disease, boosted education and reinvigorated
    the culture oftheir people.
