TEXT:
Sen. Domenici just accepted a Lautenberg amendment which would cover both
those disabled after entry and the aged non-disabled. Domenici indicated
this would be an issue to work out in conference with the House and the
White House, but said accepting the amendment seemed the best course for
now.

Lautenberg's amendment apparently did this by striking the "September 30,
1997" end date for the covering disabled after entry.
