Q:   WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO TODA Y'S NEW YORK TIMES STORY THAT
     STATES THAT SENATOR BREAUX IS ASKING THE CONGRESS TO WAIT
     FOR THE MEDICARE COMMISSION BEFORE CONSIDERING THE
     PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO OFFER MEDICARE FOR AMERICANS AGES
     55 TO 65?

A:   We do not believe that this story fully reflects Senator Breaux's views on this issue.
     Senator Breaux has accurately stated that the Medicare Commission has been charged
     with the responsibility of looking at this issue as well as a wide range of other issues. But
     Senator Breaux is not saying that he would explicitly stand in the way of legislation that
     expands coverage options, such as the President's proposal.

     The President believes that this is a fmancially responsible and targeted policy that
     addresses a vulnerable population that the private insurance market has failed to
     serve. Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure populations: they
     have less access to and a greater risk oflosing employer-based health insurance; and they
     are twice as likely to have health problems. The policies proposed by the President are
     paid for and responsible, and will help people with few affordable choices for health
     insurance.

     While the work of the Medicare Commission will be extremely important, the
     President does not believe that the American public would sanction holding up a
     targeted, important proposal that would help hundreds of thousands of Americans
     with access to health insurance. The President is confident that as Congress examines
     the needs of this population and the proposal to address it, the necessary consensus to
     move this legislation forward will be achieved.



Q:   ISN'T THIS EXACTLY THE WRONG TIME TO PROPOSE EXPANDING
     MEDICARE -- JUST WHEN THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO MAKE
     RECOMMENDA TIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL FINANCING OF THE
     PROGRAM?

A:   The President has a targeted proposal that is paid for within the Medicare program and
     therefore does not add any new burdens to the program. We believe this is a worthy goal
     that is fully consistent with the charge of the Medicare Commission. The Medicare
     Commission will be working to develop proposals for the overall financing of
     Medicare. The President's proposed policy will not conflict with the Commission's
     work in this area.
