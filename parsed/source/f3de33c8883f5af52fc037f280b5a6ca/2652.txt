TEXT:
Dan Tarullo asked that, in his absence, I forward a copy of the proposal
tabled by France over this past week-end for a paragraph on human cloning
to be incorporated in the Denver Summit Communique. He wanted me to check
with you whether it is "affirmatively desireable" or harmful for us to
include a reference such as this in the communique.  It is assumed that we
will have to work on the language in any case.

Human cloning:

        We have taken note with great concern of recent scientific
experiments which could open the way to reproductive human cloning. We
agree that the prohibition of any form of reproductive human cloning needs
both strict domestic legislation and close international cooperation to
adapt current international law.  We are encouraged by the reflections
underway within national ethics committees as well as in various regional
and international fora.  We are determined to give a strong impetus to
their work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a universal ban
on reproductive human cloning.


(I sent this language to Elizabeth Drye and Rachel Levinson yesterday.)
