TEXT:
OMB's press office received calls today regarding the Volunteer bill, HR
911.  Evidentally, the AP says that Coverdell is telling reporters in
Georgia that our Statement is incorrect. He says that the bill does not
contain the "total prohibition on joint and several liability for
non-economic damages." Our SAP (3rd paragraph) says the "total
prohibition" would "unfairly and inequitably impact poor, sick, and older
Americans."

Ellen, I understand that you and Larry Haas are trading calls to discuss.
