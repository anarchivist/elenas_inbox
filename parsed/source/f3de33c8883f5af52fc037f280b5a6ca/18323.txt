proposal. Some Republicans, including Senator Gramm and Rep. Bill Thomas, have been
extremely critical of the proposal suggesting that this is the wrong time to expand Medicare, as
the program is facing insolvency and these problems will only be exacerbated as baby boomers
begin to retire. The base Democrats were quite pleased with your proposals -- particularly after
Republicans strongly opposed them. While liberal groups were also pleased we are addressing
this issue, they believe there needs to be a more affordable option for low-income Americans.
Elite validators gave this policy mixed reviews: while they generally recognized that this is a
population in great need, they were concerned about ~he impact of this reform on Medicare and
some believed that this policy could cause a modest amount of early retirement.

This proposal did, however, strike a positive chord with the public as well as with other
validators. The New York Times and USA Today were quite positive about the policy,
particularly because it addresses an important population and is paid for in a fiscally responsible
manner. As a consequence, some Republican analysts believe that this will be a difficult issue
to oppose throughout the year.

Robert Reich's Proposal for Fixed Dollars for Health Care. You asked for an analysis of
Robert Reich's proposal to forgo a new increase in the minimum wage and instead require that
employers require a certain fixed dollar amount for health care. As you will recall, we did forgo
proposing a minimum wage increase when we proposed the Health Security Act because we did
not want to load up the costs to employers. The idea of having a defined minimum employer
contribution certainly has some merit as it would make a significant contribution to decreasing
the number of uninsured. Having said that, there are a number of political and policy issues that
have to be seriously considered prior to pursuing such a proposal.

There are numerous political and administrative complications that would have to be worked out
before moving forward on such an initiative, such as: (1) whether or not we would be forced to
add subsidies for this; (2) whether employers would be accountable if their employees had
coverage from their spouse's employers; or (3) whether certain employers would be exempt.

Having said this, if you would like to further pursue this you should be aware that of some of the
disadvantages. We will have to use a great deal of capital with the employer community as we
move forward on our other current health care policies such as health care quality and the
COBRA extension for the "promise breaker" employees who have dropped retiree health care
coverage. Adding this proposal to the mix would no doubt create a great deal of public
animosity from the employer community. Moreover, in a Republican Congress there is no
chance that this would pass and it would likely be characterized as another step to "take over the
health care system." Although liberal Democrats would be comfortable with this proposal, our
centrist Democrats would not support it, primarily because of the opposition from the small
business community.

HMOs were dropping benefits because of changes in Medicare reimbursement policies. We
have asked HHS to review the extent to which this is occurring. However, it is important to
note that many independent policy experts believe that payments to HMOs still are, on average,
excessive given the fact that they continue to attract disproportionately healthy populations.
They believe that any movement towards reducing benefits are more attributable to HMO's
desire for adequate profit margins for their investors rather than adjustments in reimbursement
issue. In fact, one corporate executive just informed us that Medicare continues to be their
number one most profitable player. Having said that, the fact that the BBA is starting to reduce
Medicare reimbursements to HMOs will clearly contribute to lower revenues for these health
plans. It is important to note that the added benefits in Medicare HMO plans do help encourage
beneficiaries to participate in these plans. The outstanding question is whether or not we want
to allow payment rates to exceed what is necessary so as to ensure that these additional benefits
are in place. Regardless, any move in this direction would be premature until we have better
information about the extent to which HMOs are reducing benefits and the reasons behind such a
trend.
