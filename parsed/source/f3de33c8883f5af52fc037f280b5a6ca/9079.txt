SAN FRANCISCO GAY RIGHTS CONTROVERSY
GUESTS: Rep. FRANK RIGGS, Mayor WILLIE BROWN
HIGHLIGHT:
MAYOR SIGNS BILL EXPANDING GAY RIGHTS
AARON BROWN, Host: Does anyone like to be ordered around? No. Like it or
not,
though, a lot of people lately have been telling others what to do and
what to
think about homosexuality.
Sen. TRENT LOTT (R): (clip from "America's Voice," June 18) There are all
kinds of problems and addictions and ...
AARON BROWN: (voice-over) From Senator Trent Lott's controversial comments
about homosexuality to an ad campaign by a coalition of Christian groups to
rulings by two churches, one condemning homosexual marriages, the other
prohibiting the ordination of gays, now comes another chapter in the
debate.
     With one of the country's largest gay populations, San Francisco has
always been ahead of the curve on gay rights. The city not only provides
health benefits to its employees' domestic partners, it also requires all
companies, even charities doing business with the city, to do the same.
     But last month, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that
would cut off San Francisco's federal housing funding if the city continues
its domestic partners policy. San Francisco's mayor, Willie Brown, says the
city will do without the money. And this week, he signed a measure that
expands gay rights even more, requiring local businesses to offer gay
couples


the same discounts as heterosexual couples.
      (on camera) This morning, Mayor Willie Brown joins us from the Bay
area,
and in Washington we're joined by the other major player in this debate,
u.s.
Representative Frank Riggs. Good morning to both of you, thanks for coming
in
this morning.
      Congressman, let me start with you. As best I can tell, there was no
hollering for something in San Francisco. People in San Francisco seemed
to be
reasonably pleased with how things were going under these ordinances. Other
than for political reasons, why'd you feel you needed to get involved in
this?
Rep. FRANK RIGGS (R), California: Because the city of     and county of San
Francisco, which is one unit of local government, is using federal
contracts
and grants to basically force private employers and nonprofit
organizations to
offer domestic partner benefits to their employees.
      And in the case of Catholic Charities and in the case of Salvation
Army,
Salvation Army, which has been in San Francisco for over 100 years
providing
services to the truly needy and desperately poor, those organizations
objected
to the San Francisco ordinance because of moral and religious reasons.
      And I think it's very important that we have a debate in the congress
on
using federal taxpayer funding in this manner, and that we support the
right
of organizations like Salvation Army to adhere to the Judeo-Christian
principles they've always followed.
AARON BROWN: And conversely, Mayor Brown, are you at all uncomfortable
about
forcing companies or nonprofits, so on, to adhere to the city's notion of
what
is correct, when they may have really strong moral feelings on the other
side?
Mayor WILLIE BROWN (D), San Francisco: I think each local jurisdiction,
through the democratic process, must make its own determination as to how
its
people are to live within the framework and the context of the
Constitution,
both at the federal level and at the state level, in all of the respective
state statutes. Local autonomy has been the hallmark of most of the
governmental units in this nation.
      Mr. Riggs has been a great supporter of local autonomy. San Francisco
is
appropriately exercising local autonomy.
      I must tell you that Catholic Charities, an organization that Mr.
Riggs
referred to, found it appropriate to give the option to its employees to so
designate someone as a beneficiary, and the end result of them, compliance
with the domestic partners ordinance. And every other organization could do
the same.
AARON BROWN: Congress ...
Mayor WILLIE BROWN: I must also tell Mr. Riggs that the local Salvation
Army
wanted appropriately to comply with all of the rules and regulations


     imposed
     by San Francisco. The national did not, and therefore the Salvation Army
     bowed
     out. That's their option, just as it should be our local option.
     AARON BROWN: Congressman, that whole local option issue is an intriguing
     one,
     I think, particularly for a Republican, because that is a hallmark, it
     seems
     to me, of modern Republican thought, that decisions ought to be made at the
     local level.
     Rep. FRANK RIGGS: Well, no disagreement there, except that we're talking
     about
     using federal funding, federal taxpayer money, in this instance. I don't
     have
     any quarrel if the city and county of San Francisco decides to offer these
     benefits to their own employees. I would still disagree philosophically
     with
     that decision, but that is a decision that should be made at the local
     level.
           And likewise, if they used state and local funding to force this
     policy
     on the private sector, again I don't think that it would be appropriate for
     the federal government, for the Congress, to get involved.
           But we're talking about using federal taxpayer funding here, number
     one.
     And number two, it's an article of faith with the -- with most Republicans
     that we want to minimize government interference with the private sector.
           And here Mayor Brown and the other San Francisco politicians are
     forcing
     this decision on the private sector. If a private sector organization
     wants to
     make that decision for their own employees, that's one thing. But to be
     forced
     or coerced by a governmental policy, or in this case the San Francisco
     ordinance, is another thing altogether.
     AARON BROWN: Mayor ...
     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: Every day of the ...
     AARON BROWN: Go ahead.
     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: I'm sorry.
     AARON BROWN: Go ahead, sir.
     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: Every day of the week, at the local government level,
     every single solitary issue that affects the local folk, that decision's
     made
     by local government, whether it's a stop sign, whether it's land use
     policies,
     whether it's height (?) policies, you name it, and we do it at the local
     level, and we do it in the best interests of our people.
     AARON BROWN: Is this issue worth ...
     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: Mr. Riggs ...
     AARON BROWN: Is this issue worth ...
     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: Mr. Riggs ...
     AARON BROWN: ... losing all that money over?
     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: Mr. Riggs should not under any circumstances be
     attempting
     to dictate what San Francisco should do. We would never consider the
     possibility in our sanctioning. (?) For an example, putting horrible
     substance
     in people's eyes who may be in Mr. Riggs' office. That's not something we
     would do.
     AARON BROWN: OK.
     A,R¥S Email System                                                             Page 5 of5


     Mayor WILLIE BROWN: I don't want to dictate to Mr. Riggs, however, that his
     federal funding ought to be lost because he did that.
     AARON BROWN: I need, unfortunately, to dictate to both of you at this point
     that we're about done here and out of time. It's a fascinating issue,
     though,
     because other cities are about to deal with it as well. Congressman,
     thanks.
     Mayor Brown, thank you for joining us as well.
     Rep. FRANK RIGGS: Pleasure.
     AARON BROWN: I appreciate it very much.
