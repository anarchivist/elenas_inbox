 TEXT:
 Per your voice mail, Bruce, I,'m checking into whether the federal
 government could accept funds for counteradvertising from a state
 settlement. Harriet Rabb is having discussions with the right lawyers,
 but she understands that the Public Health Service, of which CDC is a
 part, has "gift authority" i.e., can accept and use gifts.   She'll get
 back to me with a more definitive answer later today.

  I think we should add funds for document dissemination to the list as
  well. Also, don't forget to have the AGs push for the industry to hand
. over their index to the ,documents (the 4-A index) .

 For the record, O'Hara raised the question of whether we would want the
 President in the position of accepting a check from the AGs that they had
 gotten from the tobacco industry ... i.e., this was something he couldn't
 get on his own, that he had to rely on the AGs for.
