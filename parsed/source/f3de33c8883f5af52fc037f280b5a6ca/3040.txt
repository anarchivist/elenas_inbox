MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

CC:                    SYLVIA MATHEWS AND JOHN PODESTA

FROM:                  ANN LEWIS, MICHAEL WALDMAN AND ELI ATTIE

SUBJECT:               PRESIDENT'S PARTICIPATION IN FAMILY CONFERENCE


        After meeting with Elaine Kamarck and other representatives of the Vice President's
office and DPC, we have identified a number of strong options for the President's participation at
the Vice President's Family Conference next Wednesday:

·      Since the conference will focus on parents' involvement in their children's schools and
       education -- an area that is largely beyond federal authority -- we recommend that the
       President's remarks 1) include policy announcements to help facilitate that involvement,
       and 2) that he use the bully pulpit to challenge parents, teachers and schools in very
       concrete ways to increase the parental role in America's schools.

·      We recommend that (if the Vice President's office agrees) the President speak before the
       forum now scheduled to precede his remarks, to enable him to better frame the
       discussions throughout the day.

The President's Remarks

         Using the bully pulpit to challenge parents, teachers and schools. This could be the
core of the President's remarks: a series of strong challenges of specific ways to increase parents'
role in their children's schools. The challenges are now being formulated by OVP, DPC and our
offices.

        Department of Education Report on Parent-Teacher Compacts. This report
recommends specific, written compacts between parents and teachers to increase their
partnership and expand parental involvement in our schools. The President could release the
report as a guide for schools; it will also be helpful in formulating the challenges mentioned
above.

       AT&T Voice Mail for Parents and Teachers [tentative]. If this announcement is

                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


      ready in time, the President could announce AT&T's plan to donate free voice mailboxes for one
      million parents and teachers around the country, so that they can communicate with one another
      more easily. This ties in well with the above ideas.

              Defending the E-Rate [tentative]. If the Bell Operating Companies take legal action to
      block the E-Rate (which they are considering right now), this could be an opportunity for the
      President to defend its purpose. We are checking with Counsel on this.

             Charter Schools. Though not specifically protected in the budget agreement, this
      remains a core part of our education agenda and an important way to involve parents in their
      children's schools at the most fundamental level. The President could restate his support for the
      doubling of charter schools, and urge Congress to include them in the Appropriations process.

      Timing ofthe President's Remarks

              The Vice President's Office had originally suggested having the President speak last at a
      working session following an on-stage forum. However, after outlining what his message might
      be -- a strong call for parental responsibility and involvement, along with specific proposals and
      new tools to facilitate that increased role -- we believe it makes more sense for the President to
      open Wednesday's proceedings, so that his comments and ideas frame the discussions that
      follow. This would also eliminate any need for the President to modify his remarks or message
      to reflect the discussion that has taken place.                                                 .

      The Vice President's Remarks

              For your information, while the VP's Office is still considering options for the Vice
      President's main remarks on Wednesday, they expect that his main announcement will be the
      creation of a new fund by the high-tech industry -- at our request -- to help expand the use of
      computers and new technologies in our schools.                                           .

             Please let us know your thoughts on the above.
