TEXT:
A lot of things did not go as smoothly as    usual and I do think it's
because we moved the event date up at the    last minute.  I realize this is
almost always unavoidable, but in case we    ever do have a choice, I just
wanted to point out that having more time    to plan an event really does
make a difference. In the end, I think it    turned out very well. I also
heard the President was pleased.

Next week should also be a bit crazy, and we need to try to nail down our
events as soon as possible.  Specifically, we are under pressure to decide
on the message events in California so they can be released bo the press
on Thursday. Also, advance teams are arriving tonight, and they are
looking to guidance from us.  I talked to Jose and Cynthia and they will
get you their recommendations tonight.

Here's what we are responsible for:

Thursday - Brady event (Rose Garden)

Monday - PBOR (Kentucky)

Tuesday - Gun event (San Francisco)

Wednesday - Tobacco event (Los Angeles)

Thursday or Friday - Open.   Possibly Long Term Care.
