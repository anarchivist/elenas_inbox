Subject:         Re: look at this

awesome. Yes Herman is speaking, Cuomo is not coming. The graduates will
hand a model plane to POTUS so things are looking great.  Program now is:
Glickman
Herman
Michael Starnes, Chairman US Chamber of Commerce
Russ Meyer, CEO Cessna
Tanya Oden, former welfare recipient, and now inspector on production line
Jodee Bradley, former welfare recipient, and now Materials Clerk in
training facility.
(Jodee would then invite Tanya up to podium to present the President with
a model plane.  Photos would be taken, President would say thank you, and
they would take their seat.)
POTUS
