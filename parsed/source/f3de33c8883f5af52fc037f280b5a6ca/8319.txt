                      PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
               DEPARTURE STATEMENT ON TOBACCO LEGISLATION
                            THE WHITE HOUSE
                               June 22, 1998

        In a few moments I will be leaving for the Vice President's Family Reunion Conference
in Nashville, where I will speak about the health care concerns American families face. Before I
depart, I want to make clear: one of the most important health issues our families face is youth
smoking. 3,000 children a day start smoking, and 1,000 of them will die early because of it.
That is why, three years ago, through the FDA, we began to act to end the practice of tobacco
companies marketing to our children. And that is why, for the past year, we have been working
to forge an honorable, bipartisan compromise that protects our children from the dangers of
tobacco.

        A majority of the Senate stands ready to join us in making progress; but last week, the
Republican leadership placed partisan politics -- and tobacco companies -- above America's
families. Their vote was not just pro-tobacco; it was anti-family. The bipartisan bill they
blocked would not only protect families from tobacco advertising that targets· children; it would
also protect kids from drugs, and give low- and middle-income families a tax break by ending the
marriage penalty. It would [improve child care and] make an important investment in cancer
research .

       . The congressional leadership seems willing to walk away from its obligation to
America's children. But this issue is too important to walk away. I will continue to do
everything in my power to protect the health of our children. And while we wait for Congress to
heed the call of America's families, I am today asking the Department of Health and Human
Services to produce the first-ever annual survey on the brands of cigarette that teenagers smoke,
and which companies are most responsible for this problem. Parents, quite simply, have a right
to know. Public health officials can also use this new infonnation to reduce youth smoking.
Once this infonnation becomes public, the tobacco companies will no longer be able to duck
their responsibilities -- and neither will Congress. From now on, the new data will help to hold
tobacco companies accountable for targeting our children.

        Again, I urge Congress to pass a comprehensive, bipartisan bill -- rather than a
watered-down bill, written by the tobacco lobby, that aims not to save the lives of children but to
save the political lives of the congressional leadership. America's children deserve better than
that, and I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that they receive it.
                                                                     !-tp;-l)lJmp Conversion

                       PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                 REMARKS TO THE FAMILY REUNION CONFERENCE
                           NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE
                                 June 22, 1998

       Acknowledgments: First Lady; VP and Mrs. Gore; members of the roundtable

        Before I begin, I want to emphasize what previous speakers have said: no family health
issue is more important than protecting our children from tobacco. We have been working for
some time now to forge an honorable, bipartisan compromise. A majority of the Senate stands
ready to make progress by passing meaningful legislation. But last week, in a brazen act of
partisan politics, the Republican leadership chose tobacco companies over American families.
The bipartisan bill they blocked would not only give parents a chance against tobacco ads that
target children. It would also protect kids from drugs, and give low- and middle-income
families it tax break by ending the marriage penalty. It would [improve child care and] make an
important investment in cancer research. So this was not just a pro-tobacco vote; across the
board, it was an anti-family vote.

        The congressional leadership will not succeed in clouding the debate or changing the
subject from the health of our children. And they will not convince me that this battle is over,
because we're going to keep on fighting it until we win it for our children. I urge all members of
Congress to join in passing comprehensive legislation that curbs youth smoking. But one thing I
will not do is participate a charade that fails to protect our kids and instead gives political cover
to the allies of the tobacco lobby. I will not settle for anything less than honest legislation.
Because our children deserve no less.

       In many ways, this is a moment of great opportunity for America. Our economy is
strong and social problems are on the mend. Families are more secure. For five years now, our
administration has fought to give America's families more options for affordable health care.
We've helped Americans keep health coverage when they change jobs. And we've proposed a
patients' bill of rights to ensure that all families have the protections they need in a changing
health care system. Families benefit only when we put their interests above special interests --
just as we are trying to do With the tobacco bill-- so I urge Congress to act to protect patients'
rights before the end of this session.

       America is making great progress in protecting the health of all our family members,
from the oldest to the youngest. Previous speakers described the steps we're taking to fulfill our
sacred obligation to older Americans. I want to take a moment to explain what we're doing for
younger Americans -- our most precious responsibility as parents, and as a nation.

        Last year, we made a historic investment in our children's health that will give up to 5
million uninsured kids access to the medical coverage they deserve. In my balanced budget for
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
    1999, I have proposed to give states the funds and flexibility to enroll hard-to-reach children --
    because millions of them, though eligible for Medicaid, remain without coverage. And, as
    recent studies have shown us, uninsured children are more likely to be sick as newborns; less
    likely to be immunized; and less likely to receive treatment for recurring illnesses, like ear
    infections or asthma. Without treatment, those conditions can have lifelong consequences.

           Every family knows: there is no concern greater than a child's illness; there is no
    priority greater than a child's health~ That is why, four months ago, I asked eight federal
    agencies to find new ways to help provide health care for children. And today, I am signing an
    Executive Memorandum directing those agencies to implement more than 150 initiatives, from
    information for schools and child care centers to partnerships with job centers and Head Start.
    Working together, we can enroll the millions of uninsured children in Medicaid or our riew
    Children's Health Insurance Program.

            As the health care industry evolves, families' needs also change. So must the
    government that works to meet their needs. The federal commitments I am enacting today give
    government a new flexibility -- cutting across agency lines, forging relationships with private
    organizations, pooling resources to protect the most vulnerable Americans. This is more than
    good policy; it is a fundamental obligation to our families. As we approach the 21 st century, I
    am confident we will fulfill that responsibility -- and have healthier and stronger families, and a
    healthier and a stronger America.

           i would now like to open the roundtable for discussion, and I look forward to hearing all
    your perspectives.
