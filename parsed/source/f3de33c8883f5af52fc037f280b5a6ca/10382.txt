Here is the ESEA summary.     I'm doing some quick homework on the GED item
now

ESEA Reauthorization.  We have been working closely with the Education
Department on the development of a reauthorization proposal for ESEA. Our
work has focused on fashioning a set of accountability requirements --
significantly stronger than those in current law -- that would require
states and local school districts that receive funding under ESEA to (1)
immediately identify and undertake significant and sustained interventions
to turn around the lowest performing schools; (2) phase out the use of
unqualified teachers, including particularly those who are not fully
certified and those teaching out of field; (3) phase out the use of
instructional aides as primary instructors, especially in high poverty
schools; and (4) require students to meet standards for promotion. We
believe that if we can design these requirements appropriately, we will
take a big step toward fundamentally changing the nature of federal
assistance in elementary and secondary education. In the past the primary
purposes of federal aid have been to compensate for the historic failures
of states and local communities to educate the most disadvantaged
students, and to encourge states and local school districts to undertake
various quality improvements (e.g., higher standards, more computers,
smaller classes). Under the proposals we are developing, the federal
government would, after a suitable time to phase in the requirements,   no
longer invest in educations systems that are not serious enough to insist
on, and enforce, higher standards for students, teachers and schools.
