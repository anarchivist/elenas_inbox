TEXT:
I'm insisting that we vet the folks in the Education Town Hall. Hope that
is ok with you. The Scheduler wants to wait and see if Podesta agrees,
but I'm givin the list to Tom Janenda to vet regardless. Tom agrees.

(FYI: There's been a long discussion about how we shouldn't vet them b/c
the Governor's office is doing the inviting, but I don't see how that
provides any cover in the end. Also, we vet folks sitting in the audience
of the East Room.that WE have invited, and in this case each person has
the chance to speak to the President on camera and we don't know who they
are. So, I hope it's okay that we're vetting them!)
