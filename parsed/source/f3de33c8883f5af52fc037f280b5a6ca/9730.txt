Draft Signing Statement for S. 53
         I am pleased today to sign into law S. 53, the O&Curt Flood Act of
1998.08 This legislation is the successful culmination of bipartisan
efforts to treat employment matters with respect to Major League Baseball
players under the antitrust laws in the same way such matters are treated
for athletes in other professional sports.   I particularly want to thank
Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, Chairman Hyde and Representative Conyers
for their efforts in guiding this legislation through Congress .
       . The Act appropriately limits baseballO,s special
judicially-created antitrust exemption by expressly applying the antitrust
laws to certain conduct of Major League .Baseball.  The legislation would
not affect the applicability of those laws to certain matters that, it has
been argued, the exemption would legitimately protect (including franchise
relocation rules and the minor leagues). The Act provides that certain
conduct of Major League Baseball is subject to the antitrust laws; the
applicability of the antitrust laws with respect to all other conduct is
unchanged. The Act in no way codifies or extends the baseball exemption.
         The Act does not in any way limit the standing of the United
States to bring an antitrust action.   The antitrust laws protect the
publicO,s interest in the efficient operation of the free market system,
thereby protecting consumers, and the United States has standing to sue to
enjoin all violations.
         Treating employment matters with respect to Major League Baseball
players under the antitrust laws in the same way such matters are treated
for athletes in other professional sports is sound policy.   I know I am
joined by millions of baseball fans in hoping that the Curt Flood Act of
1998 helps baseball avoid stoppages of play it has too often experienced
as a result of player/owner disagreements.
