TEXT:
Pronunciation: show wong sheng shu

 Chinese term meaning:  "To watch over and help one another.  Provide
mutual help and protection.  Used to describe the ideal neighborly
attitude."

In many ways, Rachel Redington and Megan Delgleize (who have been
providing these Chinese phrases) are exhibiting the real spirit of "shou
wang xiang zhu, " by working to help us better understand what our
collegues are experiencing in China.

You too can shou wang xiang zhu by getting your bullets for today's daily
report in by 3:00 pm.
Thanks in advance.
