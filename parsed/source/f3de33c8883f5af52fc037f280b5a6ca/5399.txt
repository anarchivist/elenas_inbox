TEXT:
HHS has sent me tables showing how much each state has spent of its
federal TANF and child care block grants. HHS intends to make these data
public this week (by providing copies to GAO and APWA which have requested
them).  I will send you all copies.  I don't see anything reason for us to
orchestrate the release -- do you? Here's a quick summary:

FY '97 TANF Spending: Most states have spent shockingly little of their
FY 1997 federal TANF block grants, perhaps because caseloads have fallen
so much. On average, states spent 72% of their FY 1997 block grant in FY
'97:
         1 state (NM) spent 100% of its FY 1997 block grant in FY '97,
         3 states (CT, IL, and NC) spent between 90% and 100%.
         9 states (AZ, HI, lA, KY, MA, NH, OR, SC, VT) spent between 80%
and 90%.
         11 states (CA, DE, FL, GA, ME, MO, MS, NJ. TX, UT, WA) spent bet.
70% and 80%.
         19 states spent between 40% and 70%
         7 states plus D.C. (AR, CO, ID, IN, ND, WV, WY) spent less than
40%, including
             Idaho at 18%, Wyoming at 14% and Colorado & D.C. at 0% (I'm
checking this out).

The data show how much of the federal funds states spent, not how much of
their own state funds they spent as MOE. Because states may reserve
federal funds for future years, they have an incentive to use only what
they need. Thus, this could mean that states are saving for a rainy day;
or it could mean that they are not investing in welfare to work.

An unrelated survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures asked
states about planned state MOE spending in FY '98 found that most states


planned to spend enough state dollars to qualify for their entire federal
block grant (which could be saved for later years) .   Of the 44 states
that responded, 35 planned to spend at least 80% of historic state
spending, guaranteeing them their entire federal block grant, and 9 states
plan to spend between 75 and 80 percent (which, if they meet the work
rates, will be enough to get their entire block grant) .

FY '97 Child Care Spending: There are two ways to look at the child care
data. One is that states obligated (spent or legally committed to spend)
99.8% of the FY '97 mandatory and matching funds -- these are funds which
must be spent in FY '97 or they will be distributed to other states (only
ID, MS, and NH fell below the mark). However; when mandatory, matching,
and discretionary funds are combined, states spent only 72% of FY '97
funds.  States have up to an additional year to spend discretionary
funds.  I assume folks at HHS are thinking about the best way to describe
this in the context of our new child care proposal.
