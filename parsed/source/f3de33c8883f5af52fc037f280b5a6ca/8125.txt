TEXT:
Approps update: We are expecting that an amendment could come up on the
Treasury-Postal approps markup this afternoon to undermine the
Administration's decision on the importation of modified assault weapons.
The amendment expected would be something similar to what came up on the
supplemental approps bill -- which was subsequently withdrawn -- to exempt
from the ban those firearms that were in transit prior to the directive or
in already in bonded warehouses.  Yesterday, Rahm asked Treasury to
quietly look into drafting an amendment to reimburse importers for their
loss for a limited number of these; for example, only those firearms which
are sitting in bonded warehouses (about 2,000 guns).  Treasury/ATF is
still working it up and will vet it with Justice this morning. PeterJacoby
was going to float the idea with Lautenberg.

 I will send over a draft when I get one.
