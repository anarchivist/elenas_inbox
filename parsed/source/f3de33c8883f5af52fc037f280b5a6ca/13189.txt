RE:                    YOUR REQUEST FOR OVERVIEW MEMO ON TIMBER
Jennifer, per our conversation last evening, here?s a one
D
-page
overview of the timber situation.  I?ll be in my office early and
would be happy to incorporate your comments.


o
Update on Federal Forest Policy Issues in Oregon and Washington

Overview
        Economic conditions
The Northwest?s economy is strong in virtually all sectors.
Oregon and Washington economies are diversifying and moving away
from their traditionally high dependence on the forestry sector.
Forest product industries have enjoyed record profits, relying
largely on timber cut from private and state
o
-owned lands. Lumber
prices have dropped some in recent months, due largely to reduced
national housing construction and Canadian competition.
        Implementation of Northwest Forest Plan
The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management report that the
volume of federal timber offered for sale in FY 1995 exceeded
Forest Plan targets.  The target was 600 million board feet
(mbf); 610 mbf was actually put on the market. The agencies
expect also to exceed the FY 1996 Forest Plan target of 800 mbf.
Implementation and Effects of Rescissions Act
        Litigation
Every major feature of the logging provision of the rescissions
act is in litigation now or is expected to be shortly.  To this
point, most litigation has focused on the old
o
-growth provisions
of the rescissions act, but an increasing number of suits concern
salvage sales around the country and new challenges to the Forest
Plan itself are on the horizon (30
o
-60 days).
There are at least 20 rescission act timber cases pending before
eight federal district courts and the Ninth Circuit panels.
Timber industry plaintiffs continue to challenge the legality of
the Forest Plan and seek to expand the scope of the old
o
-growth
sale section of the rescission act.   Environmental plaintiffs are
seeking to restrain old
o
-growth and salvage sales.
The Administration?s posture in litigation has been oriented
toward protecting the Forest Plan from undermining by adverse
environmental impacts of old
o
-growth sales and, in the case of
salvage sales, ensuring our discretion to apply environmental
standards.
District court and appellate rulings on old
o
-growth sales have
been adverse to our position, raising significant concerns that
the Forest Plan is in jeopardy.

        Timber sales under Rescissions Act
The Administration has released for sale 305 mbf of old growth
timber under the rescissions act. Another 358 mbf is in dispute
for various, largely environmental reasons and has not been
released.  Figures are not immediately available for salvage

sales under the act, but FY 1995 salvage timber offered for sale
exceeded 1.8 billion board feet, considerably in excess of
pre
o
-rescissions act planned levels.
        Stakeholder Views
The timber industry appears generally to be pleased by the new
law and their courtroom victories. There is a sense that the
industry has gained revenge against environmental interests and
this Administration.  Some have speculated that major, national
timber interests are uncomfortable with, particularly, the
old
o
-growth logging under the rescissions act.
The environmental community continues to feel fundamentally
betrayed by the new law. They are pleased that the
Administration has taken litigation positions largely coincident
with their views, but doubt Administration assertions that we did
not know that the act would be construed and applied as broadly
as it has. Environmental interests have been involved in
numerous civil disobedience actions protesting rescissions act
logging. Most controversy has attended old
o
-growth sales in
Oregon, but disputes are expected to spread to salvage sales
around the country.
The general public in the Northwest can be expected to sense that
the Administration?s ?solution? for forest policy is unraveling,
and that gridlock is returning.
Administration Actions
Under White House leadership, the Administration is working to
defend the Forest plan.  Staff is developing various options for
legislation repealing, amending, or otherwise addressing problems
arising under the rescissions act.  Staff is also developing a
coordinated message plan for the Northwest, emphasizing the
successes of the Forest Plan.
