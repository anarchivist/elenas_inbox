  FYI
  From Carrie:
  Wellstone's meeting today with HHS, DOJ, advocates and us went well today.
  Everyone urged a Presidential directive/exec. order to urge states to exempt
  battered women from time limits and work requirements -- using their option
  under the welfare bill (WellstonecMurray Family Violence Amendment) .
  Sen. wellstone called for the groups to pull together and expressed his hope
  that the President would issue an exec. order/directive.
  HHS indicated Shalala's support for urging states to implement their option to
  exempt battered women, and Edelman said the Secretary supported the idea of
  reg's to make sure that states are not penalized for low participation rates
  because of battered women exemptions.
  The groups announced that:   (1) They support an exec. order/directive;
  (2) They want HHS to put out educational material to the states on the following


 (and HHS agreed):
 - screening for battered women needs to be sensitive - caseworkers need
 training on how to help women find safety, etc.
 - criteria for battered women to get a waiver needs to be carefully thought out
 (how "battered" do women have to be?)
 - women should not be penalized for disclosing the fact they are battered -
 e.g., they should not then face loss of custody of children, and they should not
 be excluded from any welfare-to-work job training available)
 They also raised:
 - HHS should form an advisory committee on welfare & Domestic Violence
 - Groups want more research and evaluation (Panetta in their June· welfare
 meeting with him supported the idea of a study on battered women and poverty)
 - Groups want more technical assistance funding (HHS said this is limited).
 - (something about battered women being included in the denominator count (they
 didn't specify what they want) .
