HEADS UP --



Varmus will be testifying tomorrow before the House Commerce Committee on

cloning ban legislation.   According to HHS staff, his statement will

concentrate on the science and will not break new ground.     The testimony

should

arrive for clearance around 1:00 p.m.     -- I'm planning to put a 4:00 p.m.

deadline for views.
