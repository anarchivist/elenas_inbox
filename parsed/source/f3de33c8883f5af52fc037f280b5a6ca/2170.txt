TEXT:
Elena:  Remember when you said we should go get a cup of coffee some
time?  (That was probably 18 months ago). Well, the bill has come due.
Instead of a cup of coffee, or reminiscing about those precise and
analytical questions you drafted for Justice Ginsburg, you have to read
this e-mail about one of your favorite issues concerning the
constitutionality of the Amtrak Board of Directors ...

After languishing for months we are now in a big hurry to move the Amtrak
reauthorization bill to the Hill by the beginning/middle of next week if
we can. The sole remaining issue that needs to be ironed prior to
transmittal is OLC's concerns about the constitutionality of the
appointment of Board members.

We are meeting on Monday at 2 p.m. to try and resolve the issue.  Our goal
for this meeting to hopefully end up somewhere near to where we were at
the end of the last go around -- that is, no proposal to modify the Board
of Directors.

DoT has drafted a response to the OLC comments (let me know if you want a
copy).   This draft discusses the problems of relying on the Lebron
decision and the heavy political and financial price which would be paid
by supporting OLC' s views (i t makes it easier to argue that Amtrak's
liabilities should be Federal liabilities in event of a bankruptcy). Neil
Kinkopf from OLC and perhaps his boss will be coming to this meeting
Monday and Bill Marshall from WH Counsel, along with other folks from
DoT.   We suspect that this issue will again require WH Counsel to weigh in
and dissuade OLC from i t s current views. Any thoughts you could share


with us, or Bill on the background of this subject woula be helpful.
Also, any opinions you have on the best way to proceed (especially
opinions which reaffirm your previous wise conclusion on this issue) would
be appreciated.
