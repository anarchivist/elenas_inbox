So, I was a hit with Mickey.

Does it make sense to distribute this to Gene (Shireman already has a
copy), Ann Lewis, Maria and others (Paul B?), and then pull them together
to see if there is agreement on moving forward on some or all of this
package?

Mike, I like the draft memo a lot. Taking this on as a four part package
from now thru the end of the school year makes a lot of sense. The April
time and event you describe for the mayors is very consistent with what we
heard from the mayors. I am very confident they will be on board with us.
Simply change OIG to IGA and refer to Mayor Helmke as chair and Mayor
Corradini as vice-chair. We met with them both.

It would be terrific if we could get this all ready for a package
announcement at the USCM breakfast at the WH on January 30. If not, we
should at least be ready to announce the Mayors Conference on Public
Education jointly with the USCM. Good stuff! Thanks Mike.
