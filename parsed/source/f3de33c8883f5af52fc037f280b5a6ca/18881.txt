PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON TOBACCO
THE WHITE HOUSE
March 7, 1998


        Good morning. This week, we took a major step to protect all
Americans -- especially our young people -- from the danger of drunk
driving, by proposing bipartisan legislation to lower the legal limit to
.08 in every state. Today, I want to talk to you about the historic
opportunity we now have to protect our nationD,s children from a far more
deadly threat: smoking.

        Smoking kills more people every day than AIDS, alcohol, car
accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and fires combined -- and nearly 90%
of those smokers lit their first cigarette before they turned 18. Today,
the epidemic of teen smoking is raging through our nation as, one by one,
our children are lured in by multi-million dollar marketing schemes
designed to do exactly that.   More of our children are smoking than every
before.  In fact, 3,000 children start to smoke every day ... and 1,000 of
them will die because of it.

        This is a national tragedy in the making that every American
should be honor~bound to help prevent. For more than five, years I have
done everything I can to stop our children from smoking before they start,
launching a nationwide campaign with the FDA to educate them about the
dangers of smoking, to reduce their access to tobacco products, and to
severely restrict tobacco companies from advertising to young people.

        But even this is not enough to fully protect our children. To put
an end to this epidemic, Congress must act.  Last Fall I called on the
Congress to put aside politics and pass comprehensive bipartisan
legislation that raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over
..
     the next 10 years so our children canO,t afford to buy them ... that gives
     the FDA the full authority to regulate tobacco products so our children
     can~,t reach them ... and that outlaws tobacco ads aimed at young people,
     so our children canu,t fall prey to the deadly threat of tobacco.

             We learned last week that if we do this, we will cut teen smoking
     by almost half over the next five years.  If we act now, we have it in our
     power to stop three million children from smoking -- and to save one
     million lives as a result.

             There are only 70 days left in this session of Congress. On every
     one of those days, 1,000 adults will die from smoking. On everyone of
     those days, 3,000 children will light up their first cigarette. And on
     everyone of those days, this Congress has the opportunity to stop them.

             So on this day, I call upon the Congress once again to come together to
     pass comprehensive bipartisan legislation to protect our children and
     strengthen our nation for the 21st Century. There is no more important
     step you can take this year. And there is no greater good we can achieve.

             Thanks for listening.
