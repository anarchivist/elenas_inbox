 1                          SECONDARY SCHOOL REFORM

 2        SEC. 1009.     Title X of the ESEA is further amended by

 3   inserting after part G, as redesignated by section 1007 (8) (A), a

 4   new part H to read as follows:


 5                     "PART H - SECONDARY SCHOOL REFORM

 6                          "FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

 7        "SEC. 10851.   (a) FINDINGS.   The Congress finds as follows:

 8             "(I) All high school students must obtain the academic

 9   foundations needed for further education and training, and to

10   succeed in an economy that is increasingly characterized by

11   global competition, evolving technologies, and high demands for a

12   skilled, literate, and adaptable workforce.

13             "(2) To be effective, high schools must not only

14   prepare students academically, they must also ensure that

15   students are connecting with adults and are receiving the

16   necessary supports to continue their personal and interpersonal

17   growth during this critical transition stage.

18             "(3) Effective high schools are places where students

19   feel safe, the school is free of drugs, and the classrooms are

20   disciplined environments where all students can learn. High

21   schools are increasingly larger places where students feel

                                                      Automated Records Management Syste,
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

 2   suburban areas.    Research shows that when students feel connected

 3   to school and to their parents, they are less likely than other

 4   adolescents to suffer from emotional distress, have suicidal

 5   thoughts and behaviors, use violence, and smoke cigarettes, drink

 6   alcohol, or smoke marijuana.

 7              "(4) Research and national data collections indicate

 8   that many high schools do not succeed in meeting these

 9   challenges.   For example-

10                     "(A) more than 20 percent of Americans, ages 25

11   through 29, do not have a regular high school diploma;

12                     "(B) on the most recent international assessment

13   of mathematics and science knowledge, the Third International

14   Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), American 12th-graders

15   outperformed students from only two of the 21 other participating

16   Nations.   A comparison of these assessment results with 4th-grade

17   and 8th-grade TIMSS scores indicates that American students lose

18   ground during the high school years;

19                     "(C) recent results from National Assessment of

20   Educational Progress reading assessments indicate improvement in

21   the performance of higher-achieving students but no improvement

22   in the scores for the lowest-achieving students.

23                     "(D) the problems facing high schools are

24   particularly prevalent in schools that enroll concentrations of
                                     X-H-2
                                                     Automated Records Management Sysl'"
                                                             Hex·Dump Conversion

 2                  "(E) relatively few high schools are undertaking

 3   serious, standards-based educational reforms.    For instance, most

 4   of the initiatives carried out through the Comprehensive School

 5   Reform Demonstrations program have been at the elementary level.

 6             "(5) Because of changes made by the Improving America's

 7   Schools Act of 1994, high schools now receive significantly more

 8   Title I funding than was the case before, and the number of high

 9   schools operating Title I schoolwide programs has increased.

10   However, evaluations indicate that Title I, by itself, has not

11   yet resulted in significant reforms in high schools.         High

12   schools now have the opportunity to use Title I funds to leverage

13   Federal, -State, and local funds to implement education reforms.

14             "(6) High school reforms can be effective.          For

15   example, schools participating in the Southern Regional Education

16   Board "High Schools that Work" program, a whole-school, research-

17   based reform initiative, have shown significant improvement in

18   reading and mathematics scores.    The Johns Hopkins University

19   Talent Development model has demonstrated promising results at

20   its initial implementation site.   The schools implementing

21   locally based reforms and participating in the Department of

22   Education "New American High Schools" initiative have generally

23   achieved improved outcomes in graduation, attendance, and

24   achievement.

 2   geared to local conditions and needs, can be effective.               These

 3   approaches include "schools within schools" and other innovations

 4   that create smaller learning environments and involve adults more

 5   fully in the lives of students,        "career academies" and other

 6   approaches that structure learning around careers, partnerships

 7   that pair schools with businesses or institutions of higher

 8   education, and reforms that reorganize the school day.               In

 9   addition, most successful reforms include a strong focus on the

10   professional development of participating educators and provision

11   of in-depth academic, career, and college counseling.

12         "(b) PURPOSES.    The purposes of this part are to-

13              "(1)   support the planning and implementation of

14   educational reforms in high schools, particularly in urban and

15   rural high schools that educate concentrations of students from

16   low-income families,    in order to-

17                     "(A) meet the needs of students at risk of failing

18   to achieve to challenging standards by strengthening curriculum

19   and instruction, offering extended learning opportunities; and

20   providing professional development opportunities to school staff;

21   and

22                     "(E) improve title I   schoolwide programs In high

23   schools;

24              "(2) support the further development of educational
                                      X-H-4

 2   students meet challenging State standards, increase connections

 3   between students and adults, and provide safe learning

 4   environments;

 5              "(3) create positive incentives for serious change in

 6   high schools, by offering rewards to participating schools that

 7   achieve significant improvements in student achievement;

 8              "(4) increase the national knowledge base on effective

 9   high school reforms by identifying the most effective approaches

10   and disseminating information on those approaches so that they

11   can be adopted nationally; and

12              "(5) Support the implementation of reforms in at least

13   5,000 American high schools by the year 2007.

15        "SEC. 10852.   (a) GRANTS AUTHORIZED.   The Secretary may make

19   administrators, teachers, and students at the school, as well as

20   members of the community, were (and will be)         involved in

21   developing and carrying out that plan.

 2                "(1) the relative need of each high school for which

 3   assistance is sought, considering such factors as the percentage

 4   of students who are from low-income families, student achievement

 5   data, dropout rates, and attendance rates; and

 6                "(2) the quality of applications, including the

10   more than one high school, the Secretary may approve the

11   application for any number of those schools.

12        "(c) SPECIAL RULES.     In approving applications under this

13   section, the Secretary shall-
