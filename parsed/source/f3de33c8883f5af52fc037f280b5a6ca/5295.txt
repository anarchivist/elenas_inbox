Florida Tobacco Settlement and Implications for Children's Coverage. You have asked whether we
could work with Governor Chiles to allow Florida to keep all or most of its settlement if it can
illustrate it is being spent on children's health coverage. While we might well like to move in
this direction, it appears that current law gives us little flexibility in this regard. The statute
explicitly requires us to collect any portion of Medicaid dollars that have been recaptured by the
states. If we do not, we are vulnerable both to Justice action and possibly qui tam suits. These
are false claims suits filed on behalf of the taxpayers against the states for not reporting their
tobacco settlement recoveries to the Federal government. The damages for such suits are treble
plus $5,000 per claim - 20 to 33 percent of which would go to the lawyer. The Justice
Department has received some preliminary inquiries in this regard.                 The only other
non-legislative way to assist states like Florida is to conclude that most of the settlement is not
Medicaid related and, as such, we have no claim on the dollars. However, this weakens our
position with respect to other states' and a national settlement. It also is hard to claim that these
settlements are not primarily Medicaid-related and, if we try, we could be sued for being in a
conspiracy with Florida in misrepresenting the amount owed to the taxpayers.          Thus, we will
be looking at the proposed legislative changes like the national settlement or a bill proposed by
Senator Graham that explicitly preempts the underlying Federal recapture requirements for the
purpose of the settlement.

Confirmation Update: Nancy-Ann Min DeParle and Dr. David Satcher. The Senate
confinned Nancy-Ann Min DeParle to become the HCFA Administrator last weekend.
Unfortunately, despite a 12-5 vote to report Dr. Satcher out of the Labor Committee, the
Congress adjourned before they could schedule a final confinnation vote. Although it seems
clear that he would have easily been confinned, Senator Ashcroft (R-AZ) placed a hold on the
vote, explicitly suggesting that the primary reason he did this was that Dr. Satcher would not
reject the Administration's position on late term abortion. Some have suggested that this was a
purely political move on the Senator's part to position himself for the 2000 Presidential run.
What is certain is that Dr. Satcher has never been a player in the abortion debate and has
explicitly said he does not intend to use the Office of the Surgeon General to forward any
abortion rights agenda. He continues to enjoy the strong support of virtually every credible health
care player in the nation, including the AMA. However, in an effort to not take anything for
granted, we are working with the AMA and other groups -- as well as key Republican Senate
supporters (Frist, Nickles, Jeffords, etc.) -- to get a successful vote soon after the Congress
reconvenes line up
have the support of the AMA and many other middle and right of center health care groups. We
are currently discussing how to best promote Dr. Satcher and this nomination and prevent it from
becoming a referendum on partial birth abortion during the recess.

Quality Commission. Next week, you are scheduled to accept the Quality Commission's Bill
of Rights. We plan to submit a memo to you on Monday which will summarize the Bill of

     Rights and recommend options as to how you might want to respond. We are also reviewing
     Executive Actions you may be able to take that will improve quality in the Federal government.
     We will discuss these in the memo as well.

     Response to HHS Study Regarding Reductions Decline in Take-Up Rates for Health
     Insurance. You asked for a response to a recent HHS study in the decline in take-up mtes for
     health insurance. It referred to a study conducted by HHS of the 10-year trends in access to and
     participation in employer-sponsored health insurance. The study's findings are not quite as
     dramatic as the reports would suggest. Between 1987 and 1996, the proportion of workers with
     access to employer-based insurance remained constant (about 82 percent). However, the
     proportion of workers accepting that coverage declined slightly, from 93 to 89 percent. This
     decline was more pronounced for younger and low-income people; today, about three-fourths of
     these groups who had access to insurance purchased it. This occurred during a period when
     premium growth was three times higher than wage growth. Reiterating this fact does confirm
     one of the tenets of the Administration's health agenda: that affordability of insurance is as
     important as access to it. We hope that the 1999 budget and the tobacco settlement will offer
     opportunities to build upon our efforts in Medicaid waivers and the Children's Health Insurance
     Program to provide premium assistance for uninsured Americans.
