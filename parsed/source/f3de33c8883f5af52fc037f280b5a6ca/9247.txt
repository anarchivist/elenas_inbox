                            Problems with the Wyden/Graham Guestworker Bill

      The overall concern with the Graham/Wyden guestworker bill is that it shifts costs and risks from
      employers to the workers and the government.

      1.     Reduces farmworkers' wages and earnings

             Farmworkers are among the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. Average annual
             earnings for a farmworker family are only about $6,500 and farmworkers are employed
             on average only about 23 weeks per year. The Wyden/Graham bill will lower wages and
             annual earnings of U.S. farmworkers:

             a.      Eliminates current requirement that the lowest wage paid be based on the "adverse
                     effect wage rate" (AEWR) -- i.e., the average statewide agricultural wage rate.
                     This way of calculating the wage was designed to compensate for the presence of
                     illegal workers by relying on a state-wide average, rather than a local prevailing
                     wage (thus, dissipating the effect of the presence of ill ega Is).

             b.      Allows growers to charge farmworkers for the cost of maintenance, utilities, and
                     repairs for grower-provided housing. This change would simply transfer some of
                     the costs of housing to the low-wage workers. This would, in effect, lower the
                     worker's actual earnings.


      2.     Growers would no longer have to guarantee any part of the work offered to recruit
             U.S. and foreign workers.

             Under current law, workers recruited must be paid for at least 75% of the work contract
             period for which they were recruited. The Wyden/Graham bill will eliminate this
             requirement:

             a.      Under the MSPA, migrant farmworkers are guaranteed 100% of the work contract
                     period for which they were recruited.

             b.      This will encourage growers to lure workers from hundreds or thousands of miles
                     away with the promise of potentially high earnings without any obligation to
                     fulfill any part of that promise.

             c.      This may also encourage growers to recruit more workers than they actually need
                     to hedge against uncertainties.


      3.     Growers would no longer have any domestic worker recruitment obligation except
             through the proposed Registry.

                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
            Under current law, if the grower is seeking to employ H2A workers, he much first recruit
            legal U.S. farmworkers for these jobs. The responsibility for this recruitment is shared
            between the prospective employer and the U.S. Employment Service. These recruitment
            requirements are widely acknowledged to be highly ineffective, but the WydenlGraham
            bill will make them even less so by only relying on the proposed "Registry":

            a.     Growers seeking to employ H2A workers would have no obligation to attempt to
                   recruit legal U.S. farmworkers except through the proposed Registry. Thus, all
                   responsibility for the recruitment of domestic farmworkers would shift to a new,
                   untried, process for which the government and impoverished, low-skilled workers
                   are entirely responsible. This proposed approach allows growers to concentrate
                   all their worker recruitment efforts abroad, abandoning domestic worker
                   recruitment to a new federal bureaucracy.

            b.     The bill would allow the new registry only 14 days in which to try to locate and
                   contact legal U.S. farmworkers to ascertain their availability and interest in
                   accepting a grower's offer of employment and get these workers in touch with the
                   prospective employer. This time period is drastically too short. Most U.S.
                   farmworkers will be extremely difficult to locate and contact in short period of
                   time due to the migratory and rural nature oftheir work.

            c.     As a result, efforts to recruit legal U.S. farmworkers for these jobs will almost
                   certainly be even less effective than at present and the use of foreign farm workers
                   will steadily increase.

       4.   Does not provide adequate mechanism for housing foreign guestworkers

            Current law requires growers who employ H2A workers to provide housing for them.
            The WydenlGraham bill allows growers to provide a payment voucher in lieu of housing
            unless the State certifies that adequate housing is not available in the area.

            Under the Wyden bill the grower employing H2A workers would have no obligation to
            assure that housing is actually available and could be obtained with the voucher. Thus,
            many workers will likely end up without housing or be encouraged to overcrowd any
            available rental housing.
