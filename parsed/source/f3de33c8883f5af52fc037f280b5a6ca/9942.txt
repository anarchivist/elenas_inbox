           Requiring Prescription Contraceptive Benefits for Federal Employees. On Friday, the Office
           of Personnel Management issued a benefits directive letter that required approximately 280
           health plans in FEHBP to adjust their benefit packages to ensure that FDA approved, prescription
           contraceptive options are covered. This requirement, which was strongly advocated by
           Congresswoman Lowey and numerous advocacy groups, was included in the omnibus
           appropriations act only after strong intervention by the White House. It will become effective for
           this fall's open enrollment period for plans available in January of 1999. Congresswoman Lowey
           indicated her interest in using this letter to remind the women's rights groups of the essential role
           you played in securing this benefit.

           Prescription Drug Benefits For Medicare Beneficiaries in Massachusetts. We continue to
           work with Senator Kennedy, Congressman McGovern, and other members of the Massachusetts
           delegation to attempt to find a viable solution to ensure that a Medicare HMO in Massachusetts
           who is providing a comprehensive drug benefit will not be forced to drop out of the program.
           This particular plan incorrectly believed it needed to comply with a State law that requires a
           comprehensive drug benefit. As a consequence, it finds itself at an extraordinary competitive
           disadvantage with plans offering less generous benefits and is now facing such a financial drain
           on its resources that it will withdraw from the program in the absence of relief. As you recall,
           Senator Kennedy requested that we support a provision in the budget that would provide
           statutory authority to address this matter without excessively harming Medicare beneficiaries.
           Unfortunately, the Republican leadership rebuffed our efforts and we were forced to consider
           administrative action as an alternative. As we review these options, we are attempting to avoid
           establishing a precedent that would make us vulnerable to other States desiring to decrease
           benefits offered to beneficiaries while alleviating the excessive burden placed on plans desiring
           to provide a comprehensive drug benefit. Our hope is that HHS can help strike this balance and
           we are urging them to do so in close collaboration with Senator Kennedy and the rest of the
           Massachusetts delegation.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
