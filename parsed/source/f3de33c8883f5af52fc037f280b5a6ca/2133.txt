TEXT:
House action on the supplemental has apparently been pushed until next
week.

In the Senate, there's a rumour that Sen. Gramm is afraid he'll the vote
on the Texas welfare amendment, so he may offer the amendment but then say
his delegation has asked for a meeting with the White House chief of staff
for next week and that out of respect for Bowles he will withdraw the
amendment until the face to face meeting.  A counterveiling force seems to
be that Sen. Hutchison still wants to push for a vote.
