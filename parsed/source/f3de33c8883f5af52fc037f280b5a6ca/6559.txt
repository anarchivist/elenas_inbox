TEXT:
Despite the announcement last week, the Fatherhood Counts block grant bill
didn't actually get introduced until today so we'll finally be able to
take a look at the actual language.   At HHS, Linda Mellgren at ASPE will
be taking the lead in convening some meetings to discuss the proposal.
Bruce, I haven't forgotten your question/comment about effectiveness of
training and marriage incentives compared to workfare for those who owe
child support..  I'm trying to find out what evidence exists (there's not
much rigorous evaluation on these programs) .
