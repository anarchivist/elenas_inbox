 TEXT:
 Attached is an agenda and a list of Foundation executives who will be
 meeting with White House and PIR staff to discuss how we can work
 together. These Foundations have funded new and innovative race relations
 initiatives nationwide, particularly'in the area of national conversations
 around race and the identification of leaders in various sectors who have
 developed promising practices.
 The suggested agenda will guide the discussion.   Please let me know if
 you have questions.

 We will inform Foundation representatives that some individuals are
 unable to stay throughout the duration of the meeting. Thanks, Audrey
 Hutchinson

                                              AGENDA

I.   Introductions

             (foundation representatives and Initiative staff describe framework of mutual interest)

2.   Update from the President's Initiative: recent developments

             In particular, how is the President's Initiative defming its mission and its
     projected actions and outcomes?

3.   Explore possible links between foundation activities and Initiative work. In the areas of public
     policy, conversation around race, and promising practices, we might discuss the following
     questions:

            -What is being done?
            -How do we measure success?
             -How do we make the connection between dialogue and promising practices?
     -What else needs to be done?
            -How do we develop a large pool of promising practices to highlight in this next
      year?
            -How do we create a process to identify, evaluate, and replicate the strongest
      promising practices?
            -How can the foundations and the Initiative work together to highlight the work
              being undertaken this year?

4.   Leadership

           What can foundations do to effectively support leadership around race in
     communities? How could we further support our grantees?

5.   Research

             What type of research do the foundations currently support and what are the
     plans for the future?

6.   Next steps

             What can foundations do to advance the work after this year?
