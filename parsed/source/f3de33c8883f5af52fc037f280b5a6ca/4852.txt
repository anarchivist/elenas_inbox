TEXT:
Sorry for taking so long. There is a third item that we've asked Diana to
help out on, and get it directly to you.   It simply reports that the
proposed regulations for IDEA (the reauthorized special education law) are
being released by ED next week. We wanted to make sure that we got some
details right about one potentially controvertial area.   In the grand
scheme of things, this whole item is small stuff, so go ahead without it
if Diana is unable to get it to you on time.==================== ATTACHMENT      1

Weekly Report: Education Issues                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Suit Filed Challenging University of Michigan Admissions Policies. This week the
organization that successfully represented the plaintiffs in the Hopwood case filed suit in Federal
district court alleging that the University of Michigan's admissions policies unconstitutionally
discriminate against white students. The plaintiffs point to grids which allegedly indicate that
grades and standardized test scores are applied differently for making admissions decisions for
whites and nonwhites. University officials respond that the grids only served as one among
many sets of guidelines, rather than a rigid barrier. A diversity plan called the Michigan
Mandate has increased minority enrollment at the school from 12.7% in 1986 to just over 25%
this year.


National Test. DPC and the Education Department have developed a series of possible
compromises on the national test we are prepared to ·explore. They were developed in response
to suggestions made by Sen. Lott's staff, and reflect our understanding of what might be
necessary to gain the support of Congressional leadership and majority and ranking members of
the appropriations conference. The areas in which think it appropriate to pursue a compromise
include: (1) making it possible for states and school districts to statistically link their own tests
with the national standards and test, so they could provide information on how individual
students performed compared to national standards without having to administer the national
test; (2) treating 1999 as a "field test" and proceeding with full implementation in 2000; (3)
capping participation in the field test to jurisdictions with no more than 50% of 4th and 8th grade
students; and (4) evaluating the field test and reporting the results to Congress before proceeding
with implementation. While we believe we could live with all four of these provisions if
necessary, our intention is to pursue them one at a time, adding new components only as needed.

We will discuss these possibilities with Sen. Lott's staff next week, and develop a strategy for
focusing negotiations around these ideas depending upon what we learn in that conversation.
