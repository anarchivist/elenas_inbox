The Honorable Pete Stark
United States House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Congressman Stark:

I am writing to convey the U.S. Department of Labor's position on
the "Health Care Worker Needlestick And Sharps Injury Prevention
Act." We believe that this bill takes important steps toward
improving protection for health care workers against injuries from
contaminated needlesticks and other sharps.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is committed
to protecting the health of workers who dedicate themselves to the
.health of others, and we are moving forward on this issue.    As you
are aware, last fall OSHA issued a Request For Information (RFI)
on this subject in an effort to collect information on how best to
reduce the estimated 590,000 needlesticks occurring among health
care workers each year.   We received nearly 400 comments and, based
on these comments, OSHA is pursuing a three-pronged approach to ·help
minimize the risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne diseases
due to needlestick injuries.

First, the agency has already proposed to require all injuries
resulting from contaminated needles and sharps .be recorded on OSHA
logs.  The final recordkeeping rule, based on OSHA's evaluation of
the public rulemaking record, is scheduled for publication this fall.

Second, OSHA will revise the bloodborne pathogens compliance
directive later this year to reflect the newer and safer technologies
now available.   The directive is used by OSHA's compliance officers
to enforce the agency's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.

Third, the agency will take steps to propose to amend the Bloodborne
Pathogens Standard by placing a revision of that rule that will
address needlestick and sharps injuries on its regulatory agenda
this fall.

In our review of the comments received from the RFI, we found that
a variety of safer devices exist that can protect workers from
needlestick and sharp injuries i however, these devices are not being
used widely enough to substantially reduce the hundreds of thousands
                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
draft

of injuries each year.   Further, comments indicate that training
and education in the use of safer medical devices and safe work
practices have proven effective in preventing exposures.  Finally,
responses indicate that staff involvement in the selection process
plays an important role in the acceptance and proper use of safer
medical devices.

We support the general intent and approach of your bill; however,
we believe that there are areas in the bill which need additional
attention.  These areas include assuring that: all workers who are
subject to injuries from contaminated needles and other sharps are
covered by the bill; the paperwork requirements do not result in
duplicative recording; and your bill is not inconsistent with OSHA's
Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.

Again, allow me to express support for the intent and direction of
your bill.  I look forward to working with you on this important
occupational health issue as you move your bill through the
legislative process.

                               Sincerely,



                               Alexis M. Herman
