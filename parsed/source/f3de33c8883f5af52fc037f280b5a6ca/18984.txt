        MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

        FROM           BRUCE REED

        RE:            Proposal on Sentencing Certain Drug Offenders


        Attached is a proposal from U.S. District Judge Oberdorfer for you to issue an Executive Order
        creating a "blue ribbon" panel empowered to commute the sentences of certain drug offenders in
        the Federal Bureau of Prisons. He specifically suggests that such a panel consider the cases of
        individuals convicted of being crack "couriers" or "cookers" (those who convert powder
        cocaine to crack) and grant them clemency after serving the powder equivalent of their sentences
        if they hold the promise ofliving crime- and drug-free lives. Taking such action, Judge
        Oberdorfer believes, would go a long way towards addressing the disparity between federal crack
        and powder cocaine sentences.

        Although we share Judge Oberdorfer's concerns about the unfairness of federal crack penalties,
        we would recommend against his proposal for several reasons. First, we believe much of what
        Judge Oberdorfer wants to accomplish overlaps with the mandatory minimum "safety valve" that
        passed as part of the 1994 Crime Act. This provision allowed federal judges to exempt certain
        drug offenders from mandatory minimum penalties if: (1) they did not have a significant
        criminal history; (2) they did not use violence, possess a firearm or commit serious injury; (3)
        they did not playa lead or organizing role; and (4) they provided information about the offense to
        the government. At the time of passage, the U.S. Sentencing Commission estimated that about
        600 drug offenders would be immediately eligible for this exemption.

        Second, we believe his proposal is too broad. Our crack sentencing proposal increases the
        trigger for mandatory minimum sentences for crack from 5 to 25 grams, so that lower-end dealers
        are not subject to mandatory minimums. By contrast, Judge Oberdorfer's recommendation is
        not limited to offenders within the lower-end range. We would recommend against any proposal
        that changes sentencing for mid- and upper-level dealers.

        Third, Members of Congress would undoubtedly contest any executive action you take to reduce
        sentences for crack defendants. Already, key Republicans (Senators Lott, Hatch, Abraham, and
        Speaker Gingrich) have strongly criticized the Administration's proposal to reduce the disparity
        between crack and powder cocaine sentences by increasing the trigger for crack. Instead,
        Republicans are threatening to pass legislation, for which they have bipartisan support, that
        simply reduces the trigger for powder cocaine. We believe then that any Executive Order you
        sign on this controversial subject will be overturned by legislation -- either a stand-alone bill or
        an amendment to juvenile crime legislation or ONDCP's reauthorization bill.

        We recommend instead that you ask Judge Oberdorfer to help build support in Congress for the
        Administration's crack sentencing proposal.
