TEXT:
I've set up 11:00 meeting with you.    FDA (Jerry Mande and possibly Bruce
Burlington) will join us.  They have   some ideas about how to move forward
we'd like to bounce off of you.  FYI   the doc running this for American
Heart Assn. has very positive things   to say about FDA's role to date and
wasn't happy with the FDA bashing in   the NYT article.
