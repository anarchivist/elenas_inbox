Subject:

I would like to pitch the idea of doing the radio address on the 20th on
education and doing it with Democratic Governors in attendance. They are
meeting that afternoon and education will top their agenda.  I anticipate
the GOP Govs will be pushing their local education theme while they are
here - and I fully expect a GOP Gov to do their radio response on the 20th.
