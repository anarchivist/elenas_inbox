TEXT:
The portion of the Brownstein article (you forwarded) underlined by the
President is encouraging. What do you think about a strategy memo framing
the domestic agenda as a whole, including arguing that fixing failing
schools is such a good issue it deserves to be at the top of a major
announcement this fal1-- and broader than simply standardized testing.
Sidney b. is very interested in arguing it as part of a "New Economy"
framwork ... and I'll send you Morganthau's resume.
