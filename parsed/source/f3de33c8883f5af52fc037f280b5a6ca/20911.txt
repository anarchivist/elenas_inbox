                     INS Naturalization - Backlog Reduction Strategy
                                      August 3, 1998

Background

Many immigration advocates have expressed serious concerns over the naturalization
backlog and INS's proposed immigration service fee increases, which primarily go toward
naturalization. The dramatic increase in naturalization applications (from 540,000 in FY
1994 to almost 1.6 million in FY 1997), along with a greater focus on the integrity rather
than the speed of the naturalization process, has resulted in an increase in the number of
pending applications. As of the end of May 1998, nearly 1.9 million applications were
pending. Currently, most applicants are experiencing a wait of 18-24 months.

Talking Points

·     I agree that the growing backlog is unacceptable. My Administration is committed to
      making management reforms and providing the resources necessary to reduce waiting
      times. In the past year, the INS has implemented several reforms to the naturalization
      process that are designed to expedite processing, while maintaining integrity. We
      recognize, however, that INS's efforts to date represent just the first steps in a long
      road -- enormous challenges lie ahead, and we are committed to meeting those challenges
      expeditiously.

·     Over the next few months, the INS will implement a set of management and process
      reforms designed to increase the focus on backlog reduction in the district offices,
      streamline the processing of applications, and improve customer service. Weare also
      committed to providing the INS with an additional allocation of funding specifically
      targeted to backlog reduction efforts.

·     We continue to believe that an increase in the fee for naturalization is necessary in order
      effectively implement and sustain necessary management and process reforms over the
      long-term. However, we will postpone implementation of the fee increase until January
      1999, in order to demonstrate our good faith as we move forward.
