TEXT:
Just got sign off from Don Arbuckle in OIRA to go ahead and do the meeting
with Bruce. They don't need to be in attendance and there is no pending
action/review in OIRA from FCC on this issue so we are clear to do the
"informational" meeting.

Can we go ahead and set a meeting up asap?    Please let me know so I can
get back to them.
