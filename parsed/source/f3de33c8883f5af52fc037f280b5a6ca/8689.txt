Subject:         **Senior Staff Coverage in August and September**

You or another staff member in your office may have received a call from
our office yesterday requesting leave plans for Senior Staff from now
until Labor Day. We mistakenly asked for a longer period of time than is
actually need. We would like to compile a list of when the Senior Staff
will be out of the office, how they can be reached, and who else may be
available during the time of the President's vacation in August and
September. Realizing that many Senior Staff are making or have made their
leave plans, we would like to have this information together by Wednesday,
July 29.

Please forward this to me via e-mail by this time.

Thank you and I apologize for any inconvenience.
