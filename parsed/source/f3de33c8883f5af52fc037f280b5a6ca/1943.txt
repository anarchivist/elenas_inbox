TEXT:
Elena: Rachel forwarded to me Elizabeth's note to you on the status of
NBAC's deliberations on cloning.  The note was accurate, but I question
the appropriateness of this topic for that audience.   It seems like this
would be an ideal opportunity for the president to talk about
education/access issues rather than biomedical research ethics--especially
if the speech is before the Tuskegee apology.   According to their
homepage, Morgan State had 24 BS graduates (last year?) in biology. As far
as I know, Morgan State doesn't have a significant (any?) biomedical
research program.  Cliff
