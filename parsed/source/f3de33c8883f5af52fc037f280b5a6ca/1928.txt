                                   Q&A re: Florida Lawsuit                         Hex-Dump Conversion
                                             4/23/97


Question:

The state of Florida has sued the federal government to overturn a portion
of the landmark welfare law bill that eliminates benefits for most legal immigrants.
Governor Chiles says the welfare law will leave state and local governments in Florida
holding the bag for billions of lost benefits. What is the White House's position on this?

Answer:

The President believes legal immigrants who work hard, pay taxes and contribute to American
society and fall on hard times through no fault of their own should get medical and other vital
assistance when they need it. That's why his budget provides $14.6 billion in assistance for
those legal immigrants who, through no fault of their own, are unable to work: children and
individuals who are disabled.

As you indicated, the state of Florida filed a lawsuit yesterday. The lawyers at the Department
of Justice have just begun to look at it, and I do not have an indication from the Department
about their plans. Generally, however, the role of the Department of Justice is to defend the
federal government when it is sued.

                                                 4/23/97                             Hex-Dump Conversion


    Question:

    The Associated Press reported yesterday that the "Texas Welfare Plan is Stalled at White
    House." Is it the usual procedure for the President to personally decide state welfare reform
    requests?

    Answer:

      One of the reasons the President signed the welfare reform law was so that the states would no
    . longer have to petition Washington to impose tough work requirements and time limits and
      provide incentives to make work pay better than welfare. The new law provides states with
      great flexibility in operating their welfare, or Temporary Assistance to Needy Families,
     programs.
     The state of Texas is asking for far-reaching changes in Medicaid and Food Stamp laws which
      affect several agencies. The agencies are working as hard as they can to examine all of the
     relevant issues, and we hope to get the State of Texas an answer soon. The agencies have kept
     the White House informed of their decision making process.

    As you know, the Administration gets a lot of waiver requests from the states. The agencies
    conduct a routine review process for each of them. Because this is a complicated issue, the
    review has been lengthy, probably a little more than we expected. But the agencies are working
    to provide Texas with a response as soon as possible.
