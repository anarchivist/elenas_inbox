draft 217
            WH CONFERENCE ON EARLY LEARNING AND THE BRAIN
                          PROPOSED FORMAT


The Conference is divided thematically and logistically into two parts. Consecutive panel
discussions address the following themes:

PANEL #1
              A)      An exploration of current scientific research, presented by leading
              scientists -- what do we now know about children's cognitive and emotional
              development during the earliest years oflife?

              Participants: Leading Neuroscientists, Developmental Specialists, NIH Scientists,
              Leading Academic Scholars

              B)     An examination of the practical applications of this research for parents --
              what can parents do to enhance the development of their children in their earliest
              years oflife, given the current research?

              Participants: parents (some on panel and others in front row) asking questions of
              the panel of experts and scientists as to how the research should inform their
              parenting. Questions by parents might include:

              ·       What does this research mean I should be doing with my child?

              ·      How much time should I spend reading to my child each day or week? Are
                     some children's books better than others?

              ·      What are a few things I can do with my child to ensure that my child
                     begins school ready to learn?

PANEL #2
              A discussion with the various sectors of society -- with the POTUS underscoring
              government's role and his Administration's initiatives and announcements --
              exploring what the sectors are doing, what they can do, and announcements of
              what they pledge to do to support families and enhance early childhood
              development -- what can society do equip parents with current research and how
              can all sectors of society apply current research?

              Participants: Pediatricians, Grassroots Practitioners, Early Child Care
              Providers, Religious Leaders, Policy Makers, Business Leaders
