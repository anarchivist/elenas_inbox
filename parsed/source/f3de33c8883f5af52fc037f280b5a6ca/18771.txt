TEXT:
As we discussed when we last met, I've asked the Education Department to
prepare some options for how we could propose to strengthen the federal
bilingual education program, when we come out against Unz.  We should have
some paper by Tuesday, and will schedule a meeting for Wednesday.

In the meantime, Secretary Riley is being interviewed by the LA Times next
Tuesday morning, on a wide range of issues. He expects to be asked about
Unz. We clearly don't want this interview to be the forum for announcing
our opposition, but we also can't expect Riley to be totally noncommital
during the interview.   His office has asked for some guidance.

Here are some talking points I think he should use.   Let me know what you
think ASAP, so I can get them over to ED.

1.   It is very important that we help LEP kids learn English

2. We are looking at the effectiveness of the federal bilingual education
program, to make sure it is working as we'll as it should; we will be
prepared to make changes in it if necessary. There is no one best way to
education LEP students, but any approach that is used must be done
effectively.

3.    I believe we should think very seriously before taking any step that
would limit local schools to the use of just one approach to helping
students learn English.
