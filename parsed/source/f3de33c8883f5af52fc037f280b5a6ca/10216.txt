     Insert at end of second paragraph:

     The legality of using Federal funds to support research using pluripotent stem cells is a
     question to be determined by DHHS lawyers.

     Ethical Issues

     I have just described the science and medical promise of research on the pluripotent stem
     cell. But the realization ofthis promise is also dependent on a full and open examination
     of the social and ethical implications of this work. The fact that these stem cells were
     produced from embryos and fetal tissue raises a number of ethical issues including, for
     example, the need to ensure that stem cell research not encourage the creation of embryos
     or the termination of pregnancies for research purposes. In strict accordance with the
     President's 1994 directive, no NIH funds will be used for the creation of human embryos
     for research purposes. We will also continue to abide by relevant statutes.

     The ethical and social issues associated with stem cell research are complex and
     controversial and require thoughtful discourse in public fora to reach resolution. To this
     end, the President has asked the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to undertake a .
     thorough review of the issues associated with human stem cell research, balancing all
     ethical and medical considerations.
