     Below is a revised POTUS letter to the Speaker regarding campaign
     finance, similar to the one circulated last week. The 2nd, 3rd,
     and 4th paragraphs, which now address the Rules Committee's
     actions, contain the only changes.
     Please let me know if you have any comments by 11 am Wednesday
     morning. The letter will go to the President's desk for signature
     on Wednesday afternoon.
     THANKS!

       TEXT:
     . July 23, 1996


              Dear Speaker Gingrich:
                Just over a year ago, I shook hands with you
              and publicly affirmed my commitment to reforming
              the nation's campaign finance laws. As the House
              considers campaign finance reform legislation this
              week, I urge you to follow through on our
              commitment and send me legislation that will
              address the American public's desire for real
              change in our political process, and in so doing
              renew our democracy and strengthen our country.
                Unhappily, I am not encouraged that either the
              leading Republican campaign finance reform bill,
              H.R. 3820 by Congressman Thomas, or the rule that
              will govern the House's debate on this critical
              issue, will lead to acceptable reform legislation.
                The Thomas legislation, while admirable in its
              goal to strengthen the role of parties in federal
              elections, will allow special interests and wealthy
              individuals to pour unprecedented amounts of
              campaign contributions into federal campaigns.   The
              measure's increased contribution limits combined
              with its failure to implement soft money reforms or
              address the rising costs of television and radio
              broadcast time and other campaign expenses will
              weaken, not strengthen, our political system.
                I am also disappointed by the decision of the
              Republicans on the House Rules Committee to
              restrict the House from debating any bipartisan
              campaign finance reform proposal.   I have


       consistently urged Congress to send me bipartisan
       reform legislation and I would specifically endorse
       the comprehensive, bipartisan legislation crafted
       by Congresswoman Smith, Congressman Meehan and
       Congressman Shays. This measure places limits on
       spending, curbs PAC and lobbyist influence,
       discounts the cost of broadcast time, and reforms
       the soft money system. Regrettably, the House will
       be unable to consider this, or any other bipartisan
       measure, due to the House Rules Committee action.
         As we work to reform campaign finance, we must
       do everything in our power to ensure that we open,
       not limit, the political process.  Our goal is to
       take the reins of our democracy away from big
       special interests, from big money, and to return
       them to the hands of those who deserve them --
       ordinary Americans. Real reform is achievable and
       I urge you to lead the House in passing sensible,
       comprehensive bipartisan campaign finance reform
       legislation and give the American people something
       we can all be proud of.
                        Sincerely,



       The Honorable Newt Gingrich
       The Speaker
       United States House of Representatives
       Washington, D.C. 20515
