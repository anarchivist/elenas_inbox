TEXT:
Attached is the scheduling request for the President to announce the award
of contracts to manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
detection devices for installation at airports throughout the United
States. Bruce had told me to bounce this idea off Sosnik who was
interested in the event (although it might be a better VP event.) Do you
all want to submit this as a possible event?   Transportation keeps
calling to inquire whether we are going to do this or not, because, if
not, they would like to announce the award of these contracts soon. Let
me know, Mary

Subject:         FAA scheduling request


Here is the scheduling request for the President to announce the award of
contracts to manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
detection devices for installation at airports throughout the United
States. While this is part of an ogoing effort to strengthen airport
security since the Gore Commission report came out in 1996, neither the WH
nor DOT has ever done an event on it.   Are you OK with submitting this?
Let me know, Mary

TO:                           Stephanie Streett

FROM:                         Bruce Reed

REQUEST:                      For the President to announce the award of contracts to
                              manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
                              detection devices for installation at airports throughout the
                              United States.

PURPOSE:                      To amplify the President's commitment to airport
                              security and to help combat terrorism in our Nation.

BACKGROUND:                   In 1996, the White House Commission on Aviation
                              Safety, led by Vice President Gore, recommended that the
                              FAA purchase innovative security equipment to help
                              insure the safety of the flying public. This announcement
                              would be the purchase of 21 FAA-certified explosives
                              detection systems and 135 trace explosives detection
                              devices, which add to the multi-year deployment of
                              innovative security equipment recommended by the
                              Commission. In FY99, FAA has $100 million to
                              continue this deployment, and the President requested
                              $100 million in his FY2000 budget.
