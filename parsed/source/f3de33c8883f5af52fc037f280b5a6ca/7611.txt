TEXT:
I am concerned about where Sen. Collins' is heading with her food safety
investigation.  She is pursing an adversarial rather than a constructive
tack. As you know, she has a hearing on Thursday that will feature a
former FDA investigator who was with the agency for 35 years -- he has
got to have good stories to tell.

We need a legislative strategy. Sen. Collins' current plan is to hold
hearings into 1999 highlighting Administration shortcomings.  She is not
planning to consider solutions until 1999.  I suggest we try to work with
her and convince her to move up her schedule so that the President can
sign a fix this year.  There are several approaches we could use:   We
could encourage Sen. Mikulski to talk to her directly.  We could have Sen.
Kennedy's Labor Cmte staff talk to Collins' Labor Cmte staff (her staff
handling the investigation are with PSI/Gov't Affairs).  The VP or other
appropriate WH staff could talk to Sen. Collins or her staff.

I would like to have a plan before Thursday.   Who should take the lead,
and how can I help? Thanks.
