Subject:         Your Favorite Thing -- A Cabinet "Retreat"

We are likely to have a series of cabinet gatherings in the coming weeks
and want to have your input and participation, so pIs give this some
thought in your copious free time.

Phase 1 would be four to six smaller gatherings, by group -- probably
domestic, economic, national security, plus some other cuts like
education, enviro, etc.

Phase 2 would be the whole group in a more relaxed situation -- but not so
relaxed that we repeat the weirdness of the January 1993 gathering.

My guess is that you would or should want to do some presenting so start
thinking.  More importantly, for the moment, I have promised to get Maria
a list of options and would greatly appreciate any suggestions you may
have.
