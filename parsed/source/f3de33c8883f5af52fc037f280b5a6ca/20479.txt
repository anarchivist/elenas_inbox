 Attached below is an Education letter regarding block grants legislation,
 H.R. 3248 - Dollars to Classroom Act.


 position: Senior Advisers Veto Recomendation
 Timing: Committee Markup· tomorrow, Wednesday (6/24). Education aims to
 send the letter by 4pm today.  Please provide comments/clearance by 3:30pm
 (5-4790).  Thank you.

 Honorable William Goodling
 Chairman
 Committee on Education and the Workforce
 United States House of Representatives
 Washington, DC 20515

 Dear Mr. Chairman:

 I am writing to express my strong objections to H.R. 3248, the "Dollars to
 the Classroom Act," both to the bill as originally introduced by
 Representative pitts and to a substitute version that I understand you
 will propose.   This legislation would convert a wide array of Federal
 education.programs into a block grants grant. The President stated last
 fall that such a step is unacceptable, and that he would use his veto
 power to prevent this approach from becoming law.   If H.R. 3248 were
 presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that he
 veto it.

 The issue here is not about who controls public education -- we all agree
 that that responsibility rests at the local and State levels. At stake,
 rather, is whether the Federal Government.will maintain its long-standing,
 bipartisan commitment to helping local communities strengthen
 accountability, raise standards, and improve student achievement, by
 providing assistance. that focuses on our neediest children and schools and
 on activities in which national leadership can playa critical role.

 The American people rightly look to the Federal Government to focus its
 efforts not on general aid to school districts, which H.R. 3248 would
 provide, but for leadership on national priorities.  These include such as
 helping States and school districts raise educational standards and
 educational achievement for all students, improving the quality of
.teaching, bringing the benefits of technology to our Nation's students,
 and increasing the availability of after-school programs.

 This Administration has worked diligently to el·iminate unnecessary
 regulations and take other steps to promote State and local flexibility in
 carrying out these targeted efforts. During this Administration, ED has
 reduced the number of regulations by ___ percent. [Add this sentence if
 available.)  At the same time, we have supported strong accountability
 mechanisms, such as the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993,
 that ensure program effectiveness and results that justify continued
 support by the taxpayers focus attention on program effectiveness.   Block
 grants would replace these worthy efforts with general aid, providing no
 focus, no accountability for results, and no rationale for ongoing support.

 I am also very concerned about language in the pending substitute that
 would provide broad authority to waive Federal requirements, now afforded
 to 12 States with comprehensive education reform plans, to all States.
 While I am a strong supporter of flexibility at the State and local
 levels, including expansion of the current "Ed-Flex" authority to
 additional States, this proposal lacks the essential ingredient of
 accountability, connected to high standards and high expectations for all
 children, that must go hand in hand with such a broad waiver authority.

 The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to


 the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's
 program and that enactment of H.R. 3248 would not be in accord with the
 President's program.·


                                                   Yours sincerely,




                                                  Richard W. Riley
