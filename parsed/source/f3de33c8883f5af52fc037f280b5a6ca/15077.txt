TEXT:
I appreciated your superb conduct of the meeting today. In terms of next
steps, are you planning a further meeting of WH types? Or further consults
with principals? Or should we proceed directly to a decision/options
memorandum? If the last, we would be happy (or at least willing) to
volunteer to get a draft in circulation (Diane left behind some raw
material for this purpose) .  Let me know.
