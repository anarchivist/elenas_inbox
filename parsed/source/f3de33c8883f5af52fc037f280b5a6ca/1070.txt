 TEXT:
 Attached is a file with this week's "Commitment Watch" information
 submitted by the summit people to Jonathan Alter of Newsweek.

 We had talked about sending it to the President on a weekly basis, so he
 gets an advance peek at what Alter will announce -- although of course
 Alter puts his own spin on it.

 One item of note:  there is a Kiwanis pledge that includes something
 called the Key Club, a high school organization, that the President
 apparently was once a member of.  The submission calls the President the
 Key Club's most famous alum.

 I will bring a copy to the Erskine meeting today.

This Week's New Commitments to the Service Summit:

Below are the commitments to the Presidents' Summit on America's Future to be announced
next week. The summit's organizers are providing this information to Jonathan Alter of
Newsweek, and it may appear as part of their weekly "Commitment Watch."

Kiwanis International will involve 250,000 young people in more than 30 million hours of
community service by the year 2000 through their sponsored youth clubs, Builders Clubs in
junior high and middle schools, Key Clubs in high schools, and Circle K International in colleges
and universities.

The submission to Newsweek notes that the President is the Key Club's most famous alumnus.

National Education Association retirees will train over 1,000 retired members to work in our
public schools, will teach over 50,000 youth to read independently, and will involve over
100,000 young people in intergenerational and mentoring programs by the year 200 I.

Utility Business Education Coalition (300 natural gas and electric company CEOs) will engage
at least 1,500,000 young people in meaningful K-12 school-to-career experiences in model
programs in a hundred communities by the year 2000.

Seventh Day Adventist Youth Service Network (or YouthNet) will pilot 100 tutoring and
mentoring projects in ten cities that will place 3,000 trained volunteers in relationships with
10,000 children in the first year alone.

Michigan Nonprofit Association along with the Volunteer Centers of Michigan and Michigan
Campus Compact higher education institutions will engage 50,000 young people in community
problem solving through volunteerism over the next five years in the state of Michigan.

Federated Department Stores will be a catalyst for 50,000 hours of employee volunteer service
in schools as tutors and mentors and will encourage employees' children and families to join
them.

University of Notre Dame's Fighting Irish Retired Service Team (FIRST) and their 200 alumni
clubs will reach over 150,000 children, youth, and families through intergenerational community
service activities ... and the Fighting Irish are challenging other alumni clubs to match their
commitment.
