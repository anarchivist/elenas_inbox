                    President Clinton: Helping to Keep Our Schools Safe
                                       April 23, 1999

In a statement today, President Clinton will announce new assistance for the community of
Littleton, Colorado and added resources for communities to help keep students safe at school.
Specifically, he will announce: (1) up to $1.5 million in immediate funding from the Justice
Department to assist the victims, their families, and the Jefferson County community with
expenses relating to the recent school shooting; and (2) $70 million in Justice Department grants
to help fund more than 600 school resource officers in 336 communities across the country.

Expanding assistance to victims. In response to the recent tragedy at Columbine High School,
and subsequent requests from Colorado authorities, the Justice Department will provide up to
$1.5 million in immediate funds from the Crime Victims' Fund to support:

              Direct compensation to victims and their family members for funerals,
              uncovered medical expenses, lost wages of parents, and private mental health
              counseling for victims;

               Additional personnel and overtime costs for critical incident stress
               management services for first responders to the crisis; and

               Added victims services and counseling personnel to help meet the immediate
               and longer-term support needs of the community.

Helping schools work with law enforcement to prevent crime and violence

·      Adding over 600 police officers for schools. School resource officers provide schools
       with on-site security and a direct link to law enforcement agencies. The President will
       announce that the Justice Department COPS Office will release $70 million to fund more
       than 600 police officers in schools in 336 communities across the country. Today's
       announcement is the first installment in meeting the President's pledge made at the White
       House Conference on School Safety to provide funds for up to 2,000 officers in schools
       this fiscal year.

·      Building on the President's successful community policing initiative. In addition to
        helping communities hire school resource officers, the COPS Office is providing $17
       million through a School-Based Partnerships initiative. This initiative emphasizes
       using community policing principles and problem-solving methods to address the
       causes of school-related crime. The grants will help strengthen partnerships
       between local law enforcement and SChools, and help them to focus on school crime,
       drug use and discipline problems. Schools have until the end of April to apply for
       these funds.

Encouraging communities to adopt comprehensive school safety strategies. In addition to
today's announcements, the President will urge communities to apply for funds through the Safe
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, which will provide up to $180 million this year -- and a total
of $380 million over the next three years -- to help 50 communities develop and implement
community-wide responses to school safety and youth violence. This initiative, which was also a
product of the White House School Safety Conference, represents an unprecedented collaboration
between the Departments of Justice, Education and Health and Human Services to provide
comprehensive educational, law enforcement, mental health, juvenile justice, and other services to
help communities prevent youth violence and drug abuse, in and out of school. Communities
have until June 1st to apply for funds under this initiative.

Sending out 150,000 additional guides on the early warning signs o/violence. Next week, the
Departments of Justice and Education will distribute 150,000 additional copies of Early
Warning Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools. The guide, aimed at teachers, principals,
parents, and others who work with young people, provides information on how to identify and
respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to violence in schools. The
guide also helps schools develop a crisis procedure checklist if violence occurs, and lists actions
students can take -- such as listening to troubled friends, involving trusted adults, and asking law
enforcement to conduct school safety audits -- to help make their schools safer. More than
200,000 guides already have been distributed to schools across the nation.
