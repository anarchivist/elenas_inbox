SUBJECT:              Negotiations on National Testing


       We're getting nowhere with Goodling on national tests. We met with him
Saturday, offered a compromise yesterday, and were told today that Goodling remains
unwilling to budge from his demand for a ban on pilot testing of any sort. We offered to
meet with Goodling again, but were told that Goodling met with Lott, Armey, and Gingrich
today, and has their support for holding firm.

        Our offer would have permitted NAGB to conduct pilot testing as planned, but also
clarified that the type of testing Goodling indicated was of greatest concern to him--tests
that would enable co-mparisons among school districts to be made--would not be allowable
this year.

        We are prepared to make additional concessions, which are outlined below. But
none of these will be enough to satisfy Goodling unless he is told by the leadership that this
is the best he can do.

        The central issue is over pilot testing. Last year's provision allowed NAGB to
continue test development but banned pilot testing in FY98. In order to keep the test on
schedule for implementation in 2001, NAGB needs to be able to pilot test individual test
items to see whether they work. Because students will be given only a sample of items, this
pilot testing will not produce scores for individuals, schools, districts, or states. The pilot
test will only involve about 20,000 students nationwide.

        We could agree to ban any pilot testing that produces scores for individuals, schools,
districts, or states (see Option 1 below). But an absolute ban on pilot testing, as Goodling
continues to demand, would kill the test.

        Attached are our fallback options for further negotiations. Each of them permits
pilot testing to occur as planned.

      Option 1 prohibits any testing this year that would enable individual scores or
comparisons among school districts. It also includes an additional NAS study that would
examine the feasibility of including test items from NAEP into state or local tests, to
determine if it will be possible for a state or school district to use its own test instead of the

        Option 2, to be offered in addtion to Option 1, would require a state or school
district to certify to NAGB that it has qualified teachers, an appropriate curriculum, and
extra help for students and schools, before it can give the tests. This responds to
Goodling's concerns that the test shouldn't be given until we know children can pass them.
 It will also appeal to the CBC.

       Option 3 is as far as we can go. It would permit pilot testing as planned, but would
not permit test implementation to occur unless specifically authorized by Congress. This
would be a major concession to Goodling--and would force us to have a virtually
unwinnable authorization fight next year.

       One final relevant piece of information for your discussions with the Republican
leadership: In Penn's polling on whether voters would support the President for vetoing
over contentious riders, a veto over language that banned the national test was the most
popular by far -- 60-32% among all voters, 57-39% among independents. In Penn's
polling, the test is even more popular than the environment.

Sec. _         Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, funds provided to the
         Department of Education or to an applicable program may not be used to field test,
         implement or administer any federally sponsored national test in reading, mathematics, or
         any other subject, or to engage in any other testing activity that would enable
         comparisons of test results among school districts: Provided, That the National
         Assessment Governing Board shall retain exclusive authority over the development of
         voluntary national tests as described in Section 307 of the Department of Education
         Appropriations Act, 1998.

AND

NAS Study on Embedding NAEP Items in State and Local Tests
The National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a study of the technical feasibility of including
      items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress or other tests in state and
      district assessments to provide a measure of individual student performance against
      National Assessment of Educational Progress standards in 4th grade reading and 8th
      grade mathematics and the quality of the infonnation about a student's performance that
      would be provided to parents and teachers. The National Academy of Sciences shall
      report the results of the study to Congress by June 1,1999.

No State or Local Implementation Without Quality Assurance

        No State or local educational agency receiving financial assistance from the Secretary of
Education may participate in any national test in 4th grade reading or 8th grade mathematics that
is supported by the Secretary and that measures individual student performance against
standards of the National Assessment of Educational Progress unless the State or local
educational agency, as the case may be, certifies to NAGB that it has developed, and has begun
to carry out, a plan to--
        (1) ensure that teachers have the knowledge and skills they need
to teach students to meet those standards;
        (2) provide all students with access to a chaIlenging curriculum
that can prepare them to meet those standards; and
        (3) provide additional assistance to students and schools that do
not make progress toward meeting those standards.

No Implementation Without Authorization & NAGB Develops Plan for Test
Implementation and Use

Sec. _     Notwithstanding any other provisions of Federal law, funds provided to the
Department of Education or to an applicable program may not be used to implement or
administer any federally sponsored national test in reading, mathematics or any other
subject that is not specifically and explicitly provided for in authorizing legislation enacted
into law. The National Assessment Governing Board shall develop a plan for the
continued development and implementation of national tests that measure individual
student performance against National Assessment of Educational Progress standards in 4th
grade reading and 8th grade mathematics. The plan shall include policies for the
administration and use of national tests. In developing this plan, NAGB shall consider
the feasibility of including items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress or
other tests in state and district assessments to provide a measure of individual student
performance against National Assessment of Educational Progress standards in 4th grade
reading and 8th grade mathematics. NAGB shall present a written plan to the Committee
on Education and Workforce of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Labor
and Human Resources of the Senate, and the President for their consideration by _ _
(prior to reauthorization of the National Assessment of Education Progress).

Propose reducing the appropriations for test development from $16 to $8-10 million.
These funds have been requested in the Education Department's Fund for the hnprovement of
Education (FIE) account. (Keep 10 million if we do both NAS studies)
