TEXT:
The meeting with the conservatives is Friday, December 19th at 2:45pm, and
will last approximately an hour and a half.  This is one of the
President's regular outreach meetings, though the scheduling was llikely
influenced by the Franklin statement about Connerly.  Richard did not have
a complete list of attendees, but it includes Kemp, Connerly and Linda
Chavez. Though members of Congress are not usually included in these
meetings, the President has invited both Lott and Gingrich.

The general format is that the President says what is on his mind, and
then gives each person present an opportunity to do the same.  There is
usually some give and take, but not necessarily with each person present.

Maria E. is in charge of the briefing. Richard thinks that it is a good
idea for us to be involved in the briefing. He is meeting with Maria now,
so we will know the schedule, etc. soon.
