    Subject: Sen Hutchison proposal--fyi



    Thanks again for meeting with us this morning.  As on many issues, we
    look forward to collaborating with the Administration on improving
    public education for all students---particularly those in Title 1
    schools. As promised, below is the scant information that I have so far
    on Kay Bailey Hutchison proposal. Please note the Troops to Teachers
    provision.

    Hutchison is expected to introduce the bill on the 19th, or shortly
    thereafter.  It will include:
     -- Ed-Flex expansion (instead of wholesale block grants);

    -- excellence grants  (incentives for student and school support
    services) for schools
     demonstrating the greatest improvement in student performance and to
     state education agencies demonstrating greatest improvement in
     strengthening teacher quality;

    -- reduction in federal funding for consistently low-performing schools
    (about five percent) with the
     funding put into a school improvement fund and made available to those
     schools to implement school choice programs (states may implement
    public
     school choice, private school choice, alternative school [charter,
     magnet] choice);

    -- reauthorizes, renames, and expands the Troops to Teachers program
    and moves authority to the Department of Education; and creates an
    enhanced tax treatment for school construction bonds in high-growth or
    low-income areas (tax exempt financing) .
