welfare Event Ideas:

Could announce TANF participation rates, along with latest caseload
numbers, at a site visit that highlights welfare reform working well.
Note that we don't know exactly when the participation rates will be ready
(probably no, earlier than later part of October) and the news may be mixed
(a number of states may fail two-parent rates).   After the new Census
Bureau's Current population Survey data becomes available 9/24, we will
also be able to update the number of people who were on welfare in one
year who were working in the following year (this number increased by
nearly 30 percent between 1996 and 1997 -- as a result, 1.7 million adults
on welfare in 1996 were working in March 1997. At the end of the month,
we'll have March 1998 data).

The Partnership also has a low-profile event planned in Denver for 10/28
which we could probably build on.   POTUS will be in Denver 10/20.

DOT plans to announce grant availability of Access to Jobs funds 10/7
this is a pretty small thing but we might be able to package with
something else.

The WTW Competitive Grants we mentioned earlier will now not be ready
until mid-November.
