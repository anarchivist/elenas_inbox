TEXT:
There is a brief meeting in Carol's office on Wednesday October 30
from 10:00 to 10:30 on the issue of privatization of welfare/food
stamps/Medicaid functions within states.  The new law will have
some impact on this, obviously, and many of us are getting calls
both from agencies and outside groups on the issue.
This will be a small meeting and quick - with no agency staff.
I thought it would be helpful to get together very briefly so that
we can share information about the impact of the new law in this
area and some of the issues that are being raised. After that, we
should think about how to work with the agencies on the issue.
Ken has indicated that his staff will put together some rough and
preliminary info on the issue for the meeting.
If you have any questions, please call.  I am sorry if there was
any confusion around this meeting.
