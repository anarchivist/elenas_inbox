       SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION CONTINUES
       ISSUING BIZARRE ANTI-GAY RESOLUTIONS

       Latest Tirade Attacks President Clinton's Executive Order Banning
       Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation in the Federal Work
       Force

       Washington, D.C. -- The Human Rights Campaign condemned yet another
       anti-gay resolution passed today by the Southern Baptist Convention,
       meeting in
       Salt Lake City. The resolution called on Congress to rescind President
       Clinton's
       executive order banning workplace discrimination against lesbian and gay
       federal employees.

            "This group seems to be obsessed with attacking lesbian and gay
       Americans
       by resolution," said David M. Smith, HRC's communications director and
       senior
       strategist. "While differences of opinion on religious matters is to be
       expected, religious disagreements never justify discrimination."

            Earlier this week, the group passed resolutions opposing same-gender
       marriage and urging wives to submit to their husbands. Last year, the group
       called for a boycott of the Walt Disney Company because of its policies
       extending health insurance to the domestic partners of gay and lesbian
       employees
       and allowing Ellen DeGeneres' character to come out as a lesbian on ABC's
       Ellen.
       The boycott failed as Disney's stock and earnings soared.

            The Southern Baptists' resolutions come the same week that religious
       political broadcaster and Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson warned
       Orlando, Fla., of hurricanes, terrorist bombing, tornadoes and meteors for
       allowing gay pride flags to be flown along city streets in recognition of
       that
       city's gay pride festival.

             The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
       political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
       lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
       ensure
       that ,lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at
       work,
       and in the community.
