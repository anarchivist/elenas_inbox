TEXT:
We have 3 separate meetings set up with DOJ, EEOC and the other lead
agencies on Thurs. and Friday {Pinzler from DOJ was out of town until
Thursday and we wanted to do DOJ first}.   We had also scheduled WH
meetings on civil rights enforcement on Wednesday and Friday.   I'm not
sure we need the WH meeting on Wednesday if we won't be able to report on
these meetings till Friday anyhow ... yes?
