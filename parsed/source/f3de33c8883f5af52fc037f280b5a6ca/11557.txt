Yes, definitely toughen up that paragraph about the vote.   Here's one
idea:

Last October, just before the November election, Republican members of
Congress joined us in promising the American people more teachers and
smaller classes. Now, just four months later, Republican leaders won't
even allow a vote to reduce class size.  This is the first big test of
whether this Congress is willing to work together to get things done, and
whether this Congress is serious about education. The choice is simple:
Are we going to give Americans smaller classes, or more partisanship?
