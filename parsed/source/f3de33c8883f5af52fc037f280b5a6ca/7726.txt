TEXT:
The following is a quick list of the issues raised by this legislation.
The 'A' list contains the ones that may have political traction.  The 'B'
list includes the more technical problems.

A.     The 'A' List

           1. The bill imposes criminal sanctions against family members.

        2. The bill imposes criminal liability on persons who may not
realize they are violating the law (as when the minor falsely informs the
transporter that she has parental consent.)  This is because the bill
predicates liability on the intent to help the minor obtain an abortion


rather than on the intent to help the minor avoid the application of a
state's parental notification requirements.

        Note --   When Senator Abraham introduced the bill, he described
the offense as involving the intent to avoid parental involvement
requirements. He did not describe the offense as it is written in his
bill -- the intent to help the minor obtain an abortion.

         3.   The bill raises troublesome federal law enforcement
concerns.   Pursuing alleged violations would require the FBI to
investigate a minor's family and close personal friends, raising serious
privacy concerns. Enforcing this law would also raise federal
enforcement resource issues.     Should the federal government be expending
its resources in conducting the types of investigations that this law
would require, and, if not, would passage of the bill merely be a hollow
gesture?

        4. The bill represents a dramatic incursion into our traditional
understanding of federalism.   Federalism presumes that a citizen is free
to take advantage of favorable laws in other states.  This bill curtails
that right.

B. The 'B' List

        1. The bill may impose the undue burden of having the minor comply
with two separate parental notification statutes -- her home state and the
state of the provider.

        2. The bill does not take into account that some states' parental
involvement laws have no mechanism for extra-territorial application.   For
example, some states impose the duty to notify a parent on the in-state
provider.  Since, by definition there is no in-state provider in the case
of an extra-territorial abortion, there is no person with legal authority
to satisfy the state law's requirements.  In such circumstances, the
federal law would be a complete bar to the minor's ability to have an
out-of- state abortion and, in those circumstances, might be
constitutionally suspect.

        3. The bill requires the minor to comply with the parental
involvement laws of the state in which she "resides." This could be a
different than the state of her domicile (permanent residence) and if so,
could lead to a result in which a transporter who takes the minor to have
the abortion in the minor's home state could be held criminally liable.
This may be particularly problematic in the case of a minor whose divorced
parents reside in two different states.

        4. There are serious statutory ambiguities.   For example, state
parental involvement statutes require taking the health and life of the
mother into account, and, for that reason the fact the bill does not
contain a health exception is permissible. But, because the bill does
provide an exception for the mother's life, it could be read as
pre-empting any other exceptions contained in state law (including
health). Another ambiguity stems from the statute's definition of a law
requiring parental involvement as one that requires the notification to,
or consent of "a parent or guardian of that minor." Some states, however,
allow other persons to provide consent, again raising the issue of whether
the federal law pre-empts state law.
