TEXT:
The topic of this Saturday's radio address is supposed to be homeownership
and housing (including welfare-to-work housing vouchers). This is our
only chance to talk about these two important agendas, and we need this
radio address.   In addition, we plan to use the radio' address to endorse
the Coates IDA bill as well as an agreement between the National
Association of Realtors (NAR). Over the past several months, HUD and NAR
have been working through the details of the initiative and they are about
to be finalized.   Under the terms of the final agreement, NAR will develop
a cultural diversity certification program which will reflect the letter
and spirit of the PresidentD,s One America initiative and will be subject
to approval by HUD.   Upon approval, HUD would permit NAR to award the use
of the One America mark and logo by real estate professional who are free
of fair housing violations and successfully complete the one-day training
program.
