President to announce child seat rule in
                              radio address


           WASHINGTON (AP) - President Clinton is expected to use his weekly
           radio address Saturday to announce a rule requiring that all
child safety
           seats in new cars be anchored by the same, simple system, The
Associated
           Press has learned.

             The rule, approved last month by the White House's Office of
Management
          and Budget and the Department of Transportation, should help
parents avoid
          the struggle to cinch the seat with a seat belt, as well as the
confusion that
          results when using seats or cars of different designs. The
design approved
          earlier involved installation of a metal bar behind the rear
seat to serve as
          anchor to toddlers' seats.

          The government estimates that about 80 percent of child car
seats are not
          properly installed. If all children using child seats were
restrained properly,
          68 children's lives would be saved annually, according to the
National
          Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

          It will take years for all child seats and cars to have the
system, however,
          because it will be required only on new products and auto makers
will be
          given lead time to install the anchors.



          Almost two years have passed since Clinton announced the proposed
          uniform child seat in a speech. Since then, the design of the
seat anchorage
          has changed, in part to try to ensure that auto makers could use
the same
          anchor system in vehicles sold in other countries.
