          Esteemed Colleagues:

          Here's a re-write of the Brady letter.  Bruce is going to shop it withe
          higher ups in the West Wing, and try and get a final decision. We mayor
          may not do it today, but we'll let you know as soon as we get a decision.

          Janet/Broderick: Are you comfortable w/your Brady supporter list?       Do we
          need to re-check?

     Dear [Brady Bill Supporter]:

            Six years ago, you showed extraordinary political courage by standing up to the gun lobby
     and voting for the Brady bill. That law has helped to make America a safer place.

            Next week, you will have the opportunity to vote on one of the most important pieces of
     gun legislation since the Brady bill. I urge you to stand up to the gun lobby once again, and
     support common sense measures to close the gun show and other loopholes.

             Opponents of meaningful gun legislation are still making the same false arguments you
     heard six years ago, that criminals don't buy guns from gun dealers or at gun shows, and that any
     new gun law is just a plot to take away gun owners' rights.

             Of course, all Americans now know the truth: since 1993, the Brady Law has blocked
     well over a quarter of a million illegal handgun sales to felons, fugitives, stalker, and other
     prohibited persons -- and no law-abiding citizen has been stopped from buying a gun for sport or
     self-protection. In fact, the Brady Law has proven to be one of the most effective law
     enforcement tools ever.

             Under pressure from the gun lobby, some in the House have proposed gun show
     legislation that is riddled with new and dangerous loopholes similar to those that were defeated
     in the Senate. I urge you to reject that approach, and support the common sense measures
     enacted by the Senate.

            Your vote on these important details can make the difference in whether or not we close
     the gun show loophole once and for all. For instance, if the current House proposal to put a
     72-hour time limit on background checks at gun shows applied to our National Instant Check
     System (NICS), the Justice Department estimates that 22 percent of the fugitives and felons that
     have been denied guns -- or more than 9,300 since the start of this year -- would have them
     today. But that is not all. The House bill would also allow hundreds of guns to be sold at flea
     markets without any background check, and it would prevent law enforcement from tracing many
     of guns that are sold at gun shows and later used in crimes.

            As a supporter of the Brady bill, you have a record of putting the interests of the
     American people over the clout of the gun lobby. In the that same spirit, I ask you again to vote
     your convictions -- and vote once again to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
