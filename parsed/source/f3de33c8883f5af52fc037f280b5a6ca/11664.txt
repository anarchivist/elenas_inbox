TEXT:
The decisions we need to make today are:

1.   Are there any changes to the report you want to make?

2.   When should we release it?

3.   Should there be a Presidential statement?

I've talked to Lorrie McHugh, Eric Olsen, and one of the adovcates about
roll-out.  We all feel that there isn't much news in it, the advocates
will only focus on the single agency issue, and while we say we support
the goal of a single voice, we don't say we will do a single agency.

   My feeling would be to:  1. remove the phrase in the summary that HHS
added saying we support the goal but want to avoid "expanded
bureaucracy." If you agree I'll go have that fight.

                        2. Release it from the agencies on Monday and let
Lorrie keep sounding out whether she thinks we will need a WH release
statement.  She wanted to look at the agencies' press releases.
