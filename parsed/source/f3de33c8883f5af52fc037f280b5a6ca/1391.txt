TEXT:
FYI,  INS is holding briefings tomorrow for the media (and for Congress
and community groups, I believe) on the new regulations that waive English
& civics tests for some disabled individuals. The regulations also
address matters of accomodation during the naturalization process for
those who need it. Because some field offices held the cases of disabled
applicants pending the issuance of these regulations, the result will be
that a sizeable backlog of cases will have their cases processed for
citizenship.

As you recall, DOJ determined that the oath could not be waived, so there
will be some of the severely disabled who will not be able to be
naturalized.   My understanding is that Commissioner Meissner therefore
will note that naturalization cannot be the answer for addressing all of
the problems for disabled legal immigrants under the Welfare Reform Act
and that the President's legislative proposal is therefore needed.

Thanks.
