MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:           Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                 Negotions on National Testing

Mr. GoodlingD,s staff indicated to Mike Cohen that the language we
offered on national tests yesterday is unacceptable to them.  They further
indicated that they were unwilling to permit pilot testing to occur, and
that they doubted that the President would veto the omnibus bill over this
issue. GoodlingO,s staff

Our offer would have permitted NAGB to conduct pilot testing as planned,
but also clarified that the type of testing Mr. Goodling indicated was of
greatest concern to him--tests that would enable comparisons among school
districts to be made--would not be allowable this year.

As a follow-up to this discussion, Elena spoke with Mr. ArmeyO,s staff,
indicating that we still hoped to work out an agreement that gave us what
we needed while still giving Mr. Goodling plenty to claim victory over.
While not responding substantively, she displayed a more open posture.

In order for us to make satisfactory progress on this issue, we need you
to send a clear signal to the Republican negotiators that, while we are
prepared to give considerable ground to Mr. Goodling, NAGB must be able to
proceed with pilot testing as planned in order for this issue to be
resolved to our satisfaction.

Attached are our fallback options for further negotiations.
