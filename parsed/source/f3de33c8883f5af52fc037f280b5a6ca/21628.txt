    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                          ELENA KAGAN
                          MARY SMITH

    SUBJECT:            DIRECTIVE TO OPM FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESOURCE
                   GUIDE

            On Wednesday, November 4, the Vice President will host a domestic violence event
    where he will announce that the Social Security Administration will now make it easier for
    victims of domestic violence to change their social security numbers. For the first time, victims
    of domestic violence will be able to get a new Social Security number by providing written
    affirmation of their domestic abuse from a third party, such as a local shelter, or treating
    physician.

            In addition, the Vice President will announce the attached directive to the Office of
    Personriel Management requiring the development of a resource guide for federal employees who
    are victims of domestic violence. This directive builds upon your 1995 executive
    memorandum requiring all federal departments to begin employee awareness efforts on domestic
    violence. While some agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the
    Department of Justice, have developed their own resource guides, this new guide is needed to
    provide one uniform guide across all federal agencies and for all federal employees.
