  TEXT:
  An article from today's National Journal on Education Test Use Resource
  Guide is below.

  FYI --       I've traded emails with Consel's office/Peter Rundlet about
  setting up a meeting with the folks in OCR to discuss the various
  editorials/responses to the draft guide and OCR/ED's proposed strategy to
  counter the claims made in various publication about the intent/message of
  the guide (e.g. sending out a letter with the guide that explains its
  purpose).   Peter said that he has raised the idea of meeting with the two
  of you, Chuck and Maria -- and that Maria was planning to pull together a
  meeting to discuss.

  > Civil Rights Cops Aim at Educational Tests
  > By Stuart Taylor Jr.
  > Contrary to recent publicity, insists Deputy Assistant Secretary Arthur
  L.
  > Coleman, No.2 in the Education Department's Office for civil Rights, his
  > office is not trying to scare educators out of using standardized tests.
  > Nor, he says, is Education trying to force perpetual use of racial
  > preferences in admissions at America's elite colleges.
  > Coleman seems a sincere and idealistic fellow, and I take him at his
  word.
  > But whatever his office's intent, the draft policy manual that it
  > circulated to educators last month is, to be blunt about it, a pretty
  > scary document.
  >
  > The draft--titled "Nondiscrimination in High-Stakes Testing: A Resource
  >    Guide' '--is to be issued in final form this fall, after comments by
  >    interested groups (among them the College Board and the National School
  >    Boards Association) are considered. The guide should prompt Congress to
  >    hold oversight hearings on whether the Administration's reading of our
  >    civil rights laws is at odds with efforts by school systems and


> universities around the country to measure and compare individual
> students' academic achievement and potential, the better to make informed
>   placement and admissions decisions and to raise academic standards.
>
> The draft guide,  cast in politely intimidating language, is a jarring
> blend of tendentious and confusing legal analysis. Its message to college
> admissions officers, and to state and local school administrators who use
> standardized tests in local schools to, say, place students in
> special-education programs and to determine if a student is qualified for
> a high school diploma, is essentially this:
>
> If the average black or Hispanic scores on your test are significantly
> lower than those of whites (as is true of virtually all widely used
> tests), then you are guilty of racial discrimination unless you can meet
a
> rather daunting set of standards. Specifically, you must produce
rigorous,
> scientific evidence not only that this particular test was
"educationally
> necessary, " but also that there was no "practicable alternative form of
> assessment"  that could "substantially"   serve your educational goals
> while producing more racially proportionate success rates.
>
> This draft "Resource Guide"   is not merely an academic exercise. "The
> Department [of Education) has a lot of clout, " an educator deeply
> involved in the college admissions process says. "The thought of getting
>   one of those letters that say,   'You're under investigation,' that sends
> chills down your spine. ' ,
>
> Adds Sheldon E. Steinbach,    vice president and general counsel of the
>   American Council on Education, the major coordinating body of American
>   higher education: "The issue [of whether standardized tests can survive
>   civil rights scrutiny) is pivotal in terms of the future of the nation.
>      . Given the increased evidence of grade inflation in high schools
>   throughout the country, objective ways of measuring academic standards,
>   utilized in a proper manner, need to be in place; otherwise the nation
>   stands the possibility of being engaged in massive ,self- deception about
>   educational achievement."   Steinbach also notes that portions of
>   Education's draft guide read like -'a road map for litigation.' ,
>
> The main problem with Education's legal analysis is that it misleadingly
> presents as "settled federal legal principles"   what is in fact a
slanted
> and one-sided extrapolation from a smattering of lower court decisions
> that have barely begun to explore the sensitive questions raised by legal
> challenges to educational tests.
>
> The draft guide begins with the complex body of statistically based
> "disparate-impact" case law that the courts began devising almost 30
> years ago, largely to prevent biased employers in the newly desegregated
> South and elsewhere from using tests and other devices as barriers to
> low-scoring black workers even when they were well-qualified for the
> particular job to be done. The draft guide puts a misleading spin on
those
> precedents by exaggerating how hard it would be to defend against
> disparate-impact lawsuits. It also transfers rules derived from job
> discrimination precedents wholesale to the very different context of
> educational decisions, calls made by people whom there is no reason to
> suspect of racial bias.
>


> So it is that some of the most committed advocates of racial diversity on
> the face of the earth--the nation's college administrators--are told that
> they will be deemed racial discriminators if they rely more heavily on
SAT
> scores than Education's civil rights cops think they should.
>
> One would hardly guess from reading the draft guide that few educational
> tests have ever been challenged in court on disparate-impact grounds, let
> alone found to discriminate. Nor would one guess that the Supreme Court
> has stressed (in a 1988 ruling in Watson vs. Fort Worth Bank & Trust)
that
> an employment practice with a disparate impact is illegal only if it has
> "operated as the functional equivalent of a pretext for discriminatory
> treatment"; that "the ultimate burden of proving . . . discrimination
>    . remains with the plaintiff at all times' '; and that an employment
test
> with a disparate impact is discriminatory only if the plaintiff can prove
> that it is not job-related or that some alternative would be "equally as
> effective"--not "substantially as effective' '--in choosing the best
> workers.
>
> It seems highly unlikely that the Supreme Court will ever approve
>    Education's virtual presumption that using educational tests on which
> poorly educated black and Hispanic students don't do well adds up to
> illegal discrimination. But while awaiting more judicial guidance,
>    educators may have a hard time justifying to the Clinton Administration
> any use of tests on which black and Hispanic students do less well than
> whites and Asians.
>
> Consider the Administration's successive reactions to the 1996 adoption
by
> California's voters of Proposition 209, which barred the state and local
> governments, including the University of California system, from using
>    racial preferences.   (The university's regents had adopted a parallel ban
> in 1995.)
>
> First came an  (unsuccessful) attack by the Justice Department on
> Proposition 209's constitutionality based on the Orwellian notion that
the
> vote to end official discrimination in favor of black and Hispanic people
> amounted to discrimination against them. Then, in the same spirit,
> President Clinton, in July 1997, dishonestly and demagogically asserted
> that "the people who promoted this in California think it's a good thing
> to have a segregated set of professional schools."
>
> Also in July 1997, Education's Civil Rights Office launched an
> investigation into whether the University of California's more-elite
> campuses were discriminating against black and Hispanic applicants--whose
> admissions had plunged with the abolition of preferences--by placing too
> much emphasis on SATs and other measures on which white and Asian
students
> do better.
>
> It would, of course, be preposterous to impute discriminatory intent to
> the university's administrators, who fought to keep preferences and have
> long championed the admission of as many black and Hispanic students as
> possible in pursuit of racial diversity. But in Education's view--derived
> from disparate-impact precedents in job discrimination cases--benign
> intent is no defense.
>


    > This investigation of California universities should worry almost any
    > school or college that uses any test that leads to racial
    > disparities--unless it also uses quotas or preferences to fix its
    numbers.
    > A vast body of studies shows the SAT, when considered together with high
    > school grades and other criteria (as is usual), to be the most reliable
    > known predictor of academic success in college. No other test would be
    > easier to defend as "educationally necessary. " And few schools have the
    > resources that the University of California system can muster to defend
    > its admissions process.
    >
    >    Yet the inquiry remains open, after almost two years.   (Coleman declines
    to
    > discuss its status.) Meanwhile, in February, eight minority students
    filed
    > a class action disparate-impact lawsuit charging the University of
    > California (Berkeley) with discrimination in admissions, based largely on
    > its use of test scores.
    >
    > Coleman asserts that his office does not atcack "proper"   uses of the
    > SAT. He also stresses that a prime purpose of the draft Resource Guide is
    > to provide much-needed guidance to educators from the elementary through
    > high school levels, who sometimes use tests in ways widely considered
    > improper by education experts.
    >
    >  No doubt there are educators who use tests improperly. No doubt some of
    >  them unfairly deny opportunities to some black and Hispanic children--and
    > to some white and Asian children as well. But, absent evidence of
    > systematic racial bias, is the best remedy a process of intimidating
    > oversight by federal civil rights bureaucrats whose priorities seem to
    be
    > racially proportionate success rates rather than academic excellence?
    >
    >    Congress might want to give some thought to the question.
