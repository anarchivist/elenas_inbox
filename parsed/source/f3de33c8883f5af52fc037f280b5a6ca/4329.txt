                                 STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT
                   House vote on Goodling Amendment to stop voluntary national tests

             I am disappointed at the vote of the House of Representatives tonight to block my
     proposal for voluntary national tests in the basic skills. These tests will help raise expectations
     for our students, provide clear standards of achievement in 4th grade reading and 8th grade
     math, and give parents the information they need to determine if their children on are track.
     They will help our students learn and our schools continue to improve.

             Yet the House of Representatives tonight cast a vote for the status quo and against better
     schools. The same forces that have resisted other efforts to improve public education -- to help
     states and local communities raise academic standards, keep our schools safe and drug free,
     improve teaching, [repair crumbling schools] and make the necessary investments in the
     education of our children -- have now worked to deny parents and students clear information
     about how well each student is doing. They have voted against a plan to improve our schools by
     raising standards, empowering parents and increasing accountability.

            The House vote is unacceptable to me. Last week, by a bipartisan vote of 87-13, the
     Senate endorsed my plan for voluntary national tests and embraced my proposal to place them
     under the control of the independent, bipartisan National Assessment Governing Board. Over
     the coming weeks, as the Labor-HHS appropriations bill is taken up in conference, my
     Administration will work hard to make sure that the finaIlegislation reflects the bipartisan
     support in the Senate and the broad support of the American people.
