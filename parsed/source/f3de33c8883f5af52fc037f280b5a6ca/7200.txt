TEXT:
The decision was made to have the Tobacco Event behind the First Lady's
Sculpture Garden, where a Native American exhibit is currently displayed,
at 1:30pm on Monday. Shalala has to get on a plane at 2pm, but hopefully
she can make it. If so, the speaking order is:   vp
->Shalala->Satcher->POTUS.  Satcher will physically hand the President the
report. The audience will include: health groups, anti-smoking advocacy
groups, kids from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids
(seated so they are in the picture either on stage or on risers next to
the stage) and Members of Congress. While Leg. Affairs was not at the
meeting, the assumption was that the minority caucuses would be invited.
Please let us know if you have any concerns with this.  The event will be
open press. The audience will total about 100 people, and it will
definitely be multi-racial.
