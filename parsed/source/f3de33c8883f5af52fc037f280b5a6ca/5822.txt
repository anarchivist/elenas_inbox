TEXT:
Elena/Julie: Here is the revised draft of INS' organizational structure
in the immigration chapter of the President's Budget.  The write up
reflects comments and revisions received from DPC, NSC and OMB -- and
builds off the INS draft submitted on 12/23. We believe that this draft
also reflect the discussion and agreement reached at the 12/22 meeting
with Commissioner Meissner. We have not shared this revised draft outside
the EXOP. With your concurrence on this draft, we would appreciate you
sharing this with INS to gain their agreement so we can finalize language
for the budget chapter.

As I relayed to Julie, Michael believes the reference to the CIR in the
first paragraph is useful. The CIR is the catalyst for the
Administration's current restructuring effort and by prominently
mentioning them we give some show of legitimacy to the CIR (which they are
seeking from the Administration) and this minor stroking may help build
CIR staff support for our proposed reorganization when it goes to the Hill.

Any questions/assistance, please let me know (54935).      Thanks.

 major changes in how the Federal Government sets and implements immigration policy. In
 particular, it urged a separation of the enforcement and benefit functions currently carried out by
 the INS.

  The Administration has studied various proposals for refonn, including the CIR
. recommendations, and has developed a plan to enhance immigration law enforcement and
  improve the delivery of immigration services and benefits. The plan aims to separate INS'
  enforcement and service operations in the field and through headquarters but keep the agency
  intact. This programmatic division will improve efficiency and effectiveness, while
  strengthening accountability, lines of authority, and leadership. To support these structural
  changes, the INS will also implement management and administrative improvements. The
  Administration's plan will also enhance coordination among Federal agencies involved in
  immigration and establish greater accountability within each agency. These refonns within the
  INS and across the government will support and sustain the progress made by the Administration
  over the last five years to enforce our immigration laws and fulfill the Nation's commitment to
  its immigration heritage.
