   [ submitted by ACLU, Penny Crawley, Cyber Organizer (Pcrawley@aclu.org) 1

  ***   SUMMARY   ***
  Federal Workplace Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation

  Representative Joel Hefley (R-Colorado) is leading an attempt
  to gut an executive order signed by President Clinton that
  would prohibit the federal government from discriminating against
  anyone based on his or her sexual orientation. Congressman Hefley
  has offered the repeal of this executive order as an amendment
  to the Treasury-Postal spending bill.

  The Family Research Council, a driving force in the
  Christian right, and other opponents of the non-discrimination
  policy are circulating blatantly false information about the
  President's executive order. They are telling their members that
  an individual's sexual orientation will now constitute a "specially
  protected category for consideration in federal government jobs


and promotions."

In reality, the order does NOT grant special rights to lesbian,
gay or bisexual individuals, nor does it include them in any
affirmative action programs.  It is NOT a new law.  It simply
puts in place a more uniform policy across all federal agencies
(many of which already have non-discrimination policies) that
assures equal opportunity.

*** ACTION NEEDED ***
A.       Send a FREE FAX from the ACLU website at:

http://www.aclu.org/congress/congress.html

B. Urge your Representative to oppose bigotry against lesbians and gays
by calling him or her through the Capitol Switchboard at (202) 225-3121.
