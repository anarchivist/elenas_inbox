TEXT:
In Ken's absence ...

It is not appropriate for the memo to be inviting new budget proposals
when the President has just sent his budget up.  The language in the Pres
memo that does this is point #3.   Here is a way to deal with this problem
and not mess up the budget situation:

 #3.  specific proposals for additional projects and programs that could be
 undertaken to improve the earliest years of life that do not require new
 spending, or that can be undertaken this year within the proposals in the
 FY 1998 Budget, or that could be developed for consideration for the FY
.1999 Budget, within the limits of my Balanced Budget Plan.
