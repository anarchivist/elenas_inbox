     TEXT:
     Is the purpose of this meeting to finalize the options memo to president
     or is to finalize the exec order previously sent over by DOJ? Also did
     you include VP's office given what VP said to NAACP a week ago? I've let
     Todd know about meeting in event he thinks useful to attend.
