    Bruce      I know you won't be able to make this, but I'll give you a
    report.

    Elena -- you   are welcome to attend but you don't need to -- I will give
    you a report   if you do not.  The purpose of the meeting is to get HHS to
    describe its   current welfare reform research and evaluation plans.  I want
    to make sure   we're not surprised by any reports they're doing and i want
    to make sure   we have an opportunity to weigh in on topics of concern to
    us.
