 TEXT:
 Judge Dwyer issued his order on Friday regarding the 4 sales under
 injunction and the 2 withdrawn sales. You will recall that
 plaintiffs (Seattle Audubon) asked that Dwyer rule that the sales
 did not come under the timber rider; intervenors (Washington
 Contract Loggers Assoc.) asked that he transfer the matter to
 Judge Hogan.
 Dwyer did neither.  Instead, in a short opinion which recounts the
 history of the spotted owl controversy,development of the Forest
 Plan, and passage of the timber rider, he stayed Audubon's motions
 until Judge Hogan finished with all related matters in the
 District Court and denied the loggers' motion to transfer. He
 also ruled that any party could renote the motion on one week's
 notice. In other words, he acknowledged the procedural
 complexities of the situation but RETAINED JURISDICTION over these
 cases.
 Justice also sent over a portion of the transcript from the
 arguments in this case, which as soon as one of our copier
 machines is fixed, I will forward to you.  There are a couple of
 interesting points:
 o       Rutzick makes it eminently clear that in his view, Section
 (d) of the timber rider (mandating expeditious release of the
 sales offered under option 9) "does not direct the implementation
..   ,
     of Option 9." His interpretation is that Congress was extremely
     careful and precise in NOT directing or endorsing option 9;
     rather, Congress simply directed the land management agencies to
     expeditously release timber sales in the area covered by the
     Record of Decision for Option 9, regardless of whether the sales
     comply with option 9 standards or not. Having made that point,
     Judge Dwyer then asks:
             DWYER:   "If they did not follow the plan that was approved,
     what standards would they use?"
             RUTZICK:   "Our judgment is that Congress did not prescribe
     them the standards."
             DWYER:   "So they could just order sales anywhere theyw
     anted to, the Natioanl Forest Management Act notwithstanding?"
             RUTZCIK: "That's our interpretation of what Congress has
     done. They directed sales to be prepared expeditiously,
     notwithstanding any other law."
             DWYER:   "And in the process, all enviornmental laws and all
     wildlife protection laws could be ignored?"
             RUTZICK:   "Yes. "
             DYWER:   "Would it not take a more explicit statement by
     Congress to do that?"
             RUTZICK:   "I don't think you can get more explicit than
     notwithstanding any other law."
