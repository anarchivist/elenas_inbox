Democratic Unveil Patients' Bill of Rights. On Tuesday, the Democratic Leadership
introduced their version of the patients' bill of rights in a ceremony attended by Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman. Your letter to the Leadership, which indicated strong support for this bill
without providing an all out endorsement, was extremely well received. This legislation
includes every patient protection recommended by your Advisory Commission on Consumer
Protection and Quality and builds on these recommendations, including an enforcement
provision that provides for state court-based remedies. Because the business and insurer
community is petrified that opening up the door to litigation will significantly increase their
costs, this provision is the most controversial aspect of the bill. In addition, the business
community strongly opposes this provision because it would preempt the Employment
Retirement Insurance Security Act (ERISA) protections they currently enjoy and would set a
precedent for allowing states to impose regulations beyond current Federal law. This legislation
also includes a compromise "whistleblower protection" provision that is acceptable to the labor
community and has not raised serious objections from the hospital community. We helped draft
this compromise provision, and Congressman Dingell and Senator Kennedy were extremely
appreciative of our help in this regard.

On Track to Cover One Million Children at Sixth Month Anniversary of the Children's
Health Insurance Program. Wednesday marked the sixth month anniversary of the Children's
Health Insurance Program. Donna Shalala, in an event with Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling,
announced the approval of New York and Illinois children's health plans. With these two new
approvals, eight states have come into this new program and will provide health care coverage
for one million children. At this event, we also released an NECIDPC report on the rapid
implementation of this new program. The report documents that an additional 15 states have
already submitted proposals to HHS to expand health care coverage and that virtually every other
state has a process underway to submit a proposal. We anticipate approving Michigan'S
children's health program next week, possibly in conjunction with a children's health outreach
event the First Lady is currently scheduled to hold.

Provider Tax Legislation. On Thursday, HHS sent legislation to the Hill that will provide
Secretary Shalala additional authority to significantly limit liability for states that are out of
compliance with their Medicaid provider taxes if they come into compliance prospectively. As
you will recall, this issue received a great deal of attention last fall after your line item veto of a
BBA provision to grandfather in New York's provider taxes. You chose to veto this provision
because we felt that it was inappropriate to single out New York for special treatment by
explicitly allowing them to use provider taxes that other states use that HHS and OMB believe
are illegal. The veto raised the issue of enforcement of all provider taxes and forced us to
develop a strategy to bring states into compliance. Rather than immediately implementing
enforcement actions, we called on Congress to give the Secretary more authority to waive past
liability for states who come into compliance: We set an August deadline to provide incentives
for the Congress to move in a timely basis because the Justice Department believes that an
ongoing delay of enforcement actions is contrary to current law. However, there has been little
appetite to pass such legislation in part because the Members on the Committees of Jurisdiction
-- House Commerce and Senate Finance -- do not come from states with provider tax problems,
and they believe the Administration should use its current authority to take action against these
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

states. Moreover, New York has subsequently won their court case on this issue and therefore
has no incentive to support any legislation that would toughen up on provider taxes. Other
states who have taxes that are out of compliance feel past history suggests that we will not
strongly enforce provider tax rules, and even if we do they can delay final action for years
through the courts. However, we believe that sending up legislation will place us in a better
position should Congress not act before our August deadline thus forcing us to initiate inevitably
unpopular enforcement actions.
