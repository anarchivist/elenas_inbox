      Tracey:

     Here's some immediate and informal feedback on the package you just sent
     over.  I would caution you, however, that developing a settled
     Administration position on these bills will require further discussion by
     other key folks.  For instance, I think the Dem's ten title crime bill is
     entirely new to Rahm, Bruce, Elena and myself -- not to mention DOJ and
     Treasury. Nonetheless, here are my thoughts:

     1. Senate Democratic Crime Package.   In general, most of this bill seems
     to track much of what we've been pushing already, and nothing seems to
     stick out as unacceptable. However, without the language, it's hard to
     say that there are no dealbreakers whatsoever in this bill.  Some issues
     that will require further scrutiny:

     (1) Budget.  The bill extends the COPS programs for 2 years and creates
     other new grant programs that don't currently exist in our budget.  OMB
     will no doubt want to review.

     (2) Juvenile Prosecution Grants. The Senate bill includes grants to
     states for enhanced juvenile prosecution efforts, we believe pretty
     strongly that -- as w/our COPS program -- these grants not to be direct.
     So, too, do the DA's Association, whose support will need.

     (3) Federal Prosecution of Certain Juveniles.   DOJ is sure to be concerned
     about this language, even if it is limited.

     (4) Guns.  Except for Juvie Brady and new gun penalties, the bill is light
     on the Administration other gun proposals.  Given that this is a Leahy
     bill, that is not too surprising, but Rahm and others may want to make
,~




     sure that we strike a better balance.   In the end, guns are a best wedge
     against a juvie bill by the R's.

     2. Lautenberg "One Gun a Month" bill.   To date, we have not come out in
     support of this bill.  We've had other gun priorities that we believe are
     more important (gun tracing, Brady extension, Juvie Brady, CAP
     legislation, and fighting off various NRA appropriations riders), and have
     resisted pushing this legislation. You will need to check w/Rahm on this.

     3.  Cleland Money Laundering Bill. We forwarded this bill to DOJ and
     Treasury for comment a month or so ago.  No word back from them, though
     I'll try and see where they are.  From the WH perspective, I think we'd
     like to do more on money laundering, but need to check with the
     enforcement types at Treasury and DOJ that actually bring these cases.
     They have, in fact, been working with various House members (Leech,
     Velazquez) on this issue.
