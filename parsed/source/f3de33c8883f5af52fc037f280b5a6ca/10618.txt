TEXT:
Spoke to Ron about VP level of interest in unveiling this initiative and
whether it is at all possible to do with a leak before the SOTU, b/c would
lose much of news value. We could not find any place for VP to do before
SOTU but Ron indicated he would really like the VP to this in LA -- (1/25)
if it is ok with you all to hold until after SOTU.
