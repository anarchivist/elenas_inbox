     Hi again. Thanks for your call.    I talked to the Reuters reporter and
     will be talking to an editor shortly.   She admitted that I did say
     positive things in the first part of my remarks to her and that she
     saw my statement later in the day.   I will be writing a letter to the
     editor of the Washington Times to correct our position and will see if
     Reuters can do something to help me get it corrected in other papers
     that ran the story.  I hope this helps to clarify the inconsistency.
