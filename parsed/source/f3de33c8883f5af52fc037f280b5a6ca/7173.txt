Tobacco Company Charges are False and Misleading
April 21, 1998

        In order to protect their interests and turn public opinion
against comprehensive tobacco legislation designed to reduce
youth smoking and improve pubic health, the tobacco industries
have made false, misleading and deliberately inflammatory claims
about the McCain bill. A simple explanation of the facts will
set the record straight, and demonstrate that the industry is
once again trying to mislead the public, as it has done for
decades regarding the dangers of smoking.
PRINTER FONT 12 POINT- ROMAN- ITALIC
Big Tobacco says Washington's real agenda is to fund a huge
tax
o
-and
o
-spend program.
Wrong -- our goal is to stop young Americans from smoking
before they start, by raising the price of cigarettes,
putting into place tough restrictions on advertising and
access, imposing penalties on the industry if it continues
to sell cigarettes to children, and ensuring the FDA has
adequate authority to regulate tobacco products.
Big Tobacco says the industry has been open and honest about what
it can and will do to transform the way tobacco products are
manufactured, marketed, and sold in this country.
wrong -- for decades, the tobacco industry targeted
children, and for decades, the tobacco industry denied it.
Now, the tobacco industry once again seeks to put its bottom
line above the health of children. And we are fighting
against predatory practices by tobacco companies that have


targeted America's children.
Big Tobacco says that instead of seeking a comprehensive solution
that will work, Washington has decided that politics is more
profitable for government ... [it's] big brother run amok.
wrong -- what our approach does is attack the problem of
youth smoking comprehensively, as all experts say we need to
do, by combining strong provisions on. price, penalties,
advertising, access, and FDA jurisdiction.   That's not about
big government.  It's about following the right recipe --
really, the only recipe -- to dramatically reduce youth
smoking.
o
 Big Tobacco says the tobacco plan the Administration supports
 will raise over half a trillion dollars in new taxes to fund a
 host of programs and special interests unrelated to smoking and
 public health.
·wrong -- The President's budget dedicates almost all of any
 tobacco revenues toward initiatives designed to reduce
 smoking, help find treatments and cures for diseases
 associated with tobacco, and invest in our children through
 health care coverage, needed child care, and education.   We
 believe these investments have a hatural link to tobacco
 revenue and will make a major contribution toward preparing
 the nation for the 21st century. We are happy to debate the
 best use of tobacco revenue, but first let's all agree on
 the need to reduce youth smoking by passing a comprehensive
 bill with a substantial price increase.
 Big Tobacco says the McCain bill will create 17 new federal
 bureaucracies.
 wrong -- this is just the latest tobacco industry
 smokescreen. What the bill does is ensure that the federal
 government has the authority to regulate tobacco products in
 order to reduce youth smoking and to target tobacco revenues
 to strong public health and research efforts. The so
o
 -called
 "bureaucracies" that the industry is now complaining about
 are nothing more than what's necessary to protect public
 health in this way -- to ensure that cigarettes are not sold
.to minors, to promote effective education, and to encourage
 smoking cessation. The proof that this is an industry con
 job is clear: almost all of these provisions were in the
 June 1997 proposed settlement. The industry is criticizing
 these provisions now only because the political tide has
 turned against it, and certain other aspects of the
 legislation have gotten stronger.
 Big Tobacco says the McCain bill will force the price of
 cigarettes over $5 in five years, which will in turn create a
 huge black market that will have unregulated access to kids.
 Wrong -- The McCain bill would increase the price of
 cigarettes by $1.10 over five years -- reducing youth
 smoking nearly in half -- and raising the real price of
 cigarettes to $3.20, not $5.00. We do not expect this price
 increase to create a black market. We can work with
 Congress to devise a scheme that will facilitate the effort
 to prevent smuggling, while not subjecting retailers to
 onerous requirements. This could involve having
 wholesalers, distributors, and retailers identify themselves

-- just as any business now has to do to sell liquor, and


what most states already require sellers to tobacco to do.
