 I just wanted to provide you a quick update on where each of the housing
 proposals stood. Right now, there are potentially five parts to this
 initiative:

 I. Housing Mobility
  - Expansion of HUD's Regional Opportunity Counseling (ROC)
  - Eliminate Obstacles to and Provide Incentives for Portability

 STATUS: Every agency has signed off on these proposals and they are
 already
 included in the budget.

 II. Homeownership Initiative
  - Use Section 8 Vouchers for Homeownership (STATUS: Signed off on by
 all
 agencies and already within budget)

  IDEAS WE NEED TO,DISCUSS:
  - Earmark within HOME program (with restoration of HOME funding)
  - Expansion of NRC
  - Providing additional grants to Habitat for Humanity


 - FHA-Based Reforms, such as lifting loan limit -- this is a revenue
raiser
(HUD is   coming back with specifics on this idea).


III. Fair Lending
 - Urge Fed to require banks and thrifts to report race, income, and
gender
data as    part of the CRA small business loan reporting provisions.
 - Urge Fed and' FDIC to require their regulated banks to report the
reasons
for    denial of each mortgage loan application (DCC and DTS already do so).
 - FFIEC will conduct an analysis and report back to the President within
one
year    with recommendations as to how automated credit scoring systems can
be
used to enhance rather than reduce credit available to low-income and
minority    borrowers.
 - Develop and implement methods of pre-application testing, to detect
discrimination that occurs before an application is made.

STATUS: These are non-budget related items. Treasury is working to
finalize the
four proposals.  It is not necessary for them to be done this week.


IV. Welfare-To-Work Housing Vouchers

STATUS: Paul Weinstein is finishing a draft of memo tonight.


V. Lifting Low-Income Housing Tax   Credit Limit.  Since the cost to build
low-income housing has increased    over the last four years, the program
has not
grown with the cost.   Four years   ago, the number of requests for the
LIHTC
versus the number of allocations    was 2.04.   Today, this ratio is 2.97.

STATUS: Treasury is working on options. Senator D'Amato has a bill to
increase
the LIHTC and then index it to inflation. A rough estimate suggests'that
this
bill would cost about $1.5-$2.0 billion over five years. We could lower
this
estimate by phasing any increase in over a longer time period. For
example,
the D'Amato bill increases the credit from $1.25 to $1.75 in one year and
allows it to increase with inflation. We could increase the credit from
$1.25
to $1.35 next year, then to $1.45 in 2000, to $1.55 in 2001 ... to $1.75 in
2003.  In 2003, we could then index the credit to the rate of inflation.
