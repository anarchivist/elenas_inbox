TEXT:
The attached reflects the changes we discussed. It's also been spell
checked. However, it would be a good idea if Cathy could look at it again.

I assume you will make any changes you wish, have Cathy print it out, and
send it off. Could you please send Bill and I a final version?

See you Monday.  If you need me over the weekend, I'm staying at the
Woodbridge NJ Hilton:  908 494-6200. You can also try me at either of my
brothers' houses: I            P6/(b)(6)         I Or you can wait until I
get home Sunday night, and solve whatever the problem is yourself!
