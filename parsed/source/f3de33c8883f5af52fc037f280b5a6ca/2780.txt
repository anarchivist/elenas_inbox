TEXT:
Update:  the Saturday radio address on hate crimes has already been
taped.  Public liaison will play the taped remarks on a conference call to
interested groups tomorrow afternoon. Other groups will be given a heads
up on the radio address.

The general outreach plan for the November WH conference on hate crimes
was briefly discussed.  This discussion primarily involved identifying the
key advocate groups and electeds, and assigning outreach tasks to public
liaison.

I will red dot the paper that was distributed in the meeting to you.
