DRAFT 3 - ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON LOGGING RIDER
TALKING POINTS

?       The Administration is convinced that the "logging rider" on
the rescissions act has to be changed.
?       Ancient forests are being clearcut.  Critical habitat for
fish and wildlife is being destroyed.   wild places that
almost everyone in the Northwest and the country want to
protect are being lost forever.  This has to stop.
?       The logging rider has reopened wounds that were just
beginning to heal.  It is dividing people and communities.
This has to stop.
 ,                                                                     Page 2 of2


?       In addition to the problems with the old growth provisions,
a significant number of concerns have been raised regarding
implementation of the salvage logging program.
?       The Northwest deserves better.   Forest policy should be
predictable and fair.  Environmental protections should be
solid. Harvest levels should be sustainable. Agencies
should be accountable for their actions. Most of all, the
people who own the forests need to know that their values
and their voices are being heard.
?       This Administration's Northwest Forest plan is the right way
to run federal forests in the Northwest. We have to get
back to that plan. We also have to make sure that the
salvage program meets the President's directive to obey
environmental law.
?       We have to change the logging rider.   The Administration
believes that we must:
1.      Repeal the provisions of the logging rider that opened
up the Northwest's ancient forests to logging and closed the
courts to claims that the logging violates environmental
standards;
2.      Repeal the provisions that some want to use to attack
the Forest Plan;

3.      Suspend the salvage timber program in Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, and Montana for 45 days to allow a full,
objective review of the program's implementation in those
states; and
4.      Get agreement from Congress to provide the Forest
Service and BLM the funding and other authorities they need

to buy
o
-back or find substitute timber for old
o
-growth sales
released under the rider that simply shouldn't be cut.
?       The Administration wants to work with the companies that
hold contracts for old growth timber to make sure that their
legitimate property rights are honored. But we want to
find means to fulfill their rights without any more
environmentally harmful logging.
?       We calIon companies with controversial sales to forbear
from any further cutting until we have a full opportunity to
explore together alternative means of fulfilling their
rights, whether through replacement timber under the Forest
Plan, financial compensation, or other mutually acceptable
means.
?       We will work with Senator Murray, Senator Wyden,
Congresswoman Furse, and others in the Northwest delegation
to win passage of these changes. We know there will be
opposition. But we are determined to get Northwest forest
management back on track and to restore the balanced and
reasonable approach that is achieved under the Northwest
Forest Plan.
