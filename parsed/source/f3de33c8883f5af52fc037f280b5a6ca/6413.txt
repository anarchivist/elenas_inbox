TEXT:
Gore is meeting with some of the minority caucus folks tomorrow and Gips
wanted to figure out what he could promise.  What do you think of these as
things the VP could say:

1. There should be specific language in the legislation targeting funds
for research, cessation, and counter advertising to minority communities.

2.  There should be legally acceptable legislative language indicating
that the funds would utilize minorities in a position to know and support
the community, such as historically black medical schools, newspapers, etc.

3. Note the language in Conrad on minorities and say we need to be more
specific on protecting minority communities from the fall-out of increased
cigarette prices and the possibility of less support for minority
institutions that cigarette companies have supported in the past.

4.  That we should work with the Caucuses on drafting more specific
language on how much resources will be required to offset loses from
industry investment in the communtiy and how much money will be required
for cessation and other programs.

The caucuses are exploring the idea of a non-profit minority-oriented
foundation to distribute research funds focused on minority health
concerns.  This idea may come up in meetings, but so far, evidently, the
Hispanic caucus has not signed on.
