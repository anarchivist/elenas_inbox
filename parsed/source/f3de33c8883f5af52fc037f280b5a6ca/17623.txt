TEXT:
wants to know what's next ... Levin's been hearing from Carper and Chiles
pushing him to do something -- they are being very persistent -- Levin
wants to check in with Bruce to see what we think the legislative
possibilities are for the rest of the session and what we can do
administratively.   All this per Eric Gould.
