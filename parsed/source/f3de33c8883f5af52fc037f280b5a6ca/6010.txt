     TEXT:
     Looks like Raines came to terms withe General on performance measures.
     Raines' may think that these will be "National Goals" that won't drive the
     budget (and policy), but I think we all know that we'll be revisiting the
     pieces of this document over and over again.

     Subject:         McCaffrey-Raines Meeting on Performance Measures

     Ken's e-mail nicely summarizes the events of the Raines-McCaffrey meeting
     on performance measurements. Both OMB and ONDCP are drafting "fix"
     language per the Directors' agreement.

     Total FY 99 proposed drug funding should come out to about $16.9 billion,
     +$900 million over FY 98 enacted.  I will finalize the numbers with ONDCP
     this week and will send you a revised final table.

     I will forward to you another e-mail explaining how the $100 million was
     allocated.

     Thanks.

     Today, Raines met with McCaffrey on ONDCP's aggressive, draft
     government-wide performance measures. As you know, ONDCP has proposed a
     50% reduction in demand and a 50% reduction in supply by 2007.  In brief,
     Raines agreed to allow ONDCP to publish aggressive performance measures as
     long as several conditions were met:

     -- Other agencies that have objected (e.g., HHS, DOJ, Treasury) must be
     brought on board.
         The performance measures should not be perceived as measures for the
     Federal Government to achieve.  Rather, they should represent societal
     goals, in partnership with the private sector, States/localities, foreign
     governments, and behavioral changes in society.   Also, the performance
     measures should take account of the desirability of reallocating Federal
     drug control funds from programs of lesser effectiveness to greater
     effectiveness.
         As such, the performance measures are disconnected from the Federal
     budget and should not be used to drive out year budget funding levels.

     LRD (Jukes and Jones) will be drafting suggested changes to the ONDCP
     draft text currently in circulation to reflect this agreement.
