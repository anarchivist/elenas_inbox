TEXT:
Jeanine Smartt has been helping us organize materials for the upcoming
conference and she just informed me that her supervisor at HHS doesn't
want her working on this. We really need her continued involvement over
the next 3 weeks. Can you intervene with Ann Rosewood(?) -- this is for a
limited period of time and Jeanine assures me that her involvement is not
taking time away from her HHS workload.  THanks for your help.
