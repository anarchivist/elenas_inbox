                           Questions and Answers on COPS Event
                                       May 29,1998


New COPS Initiative

Q.    What is the new COPS initiative you are announcing today? How will it work?

A.    The President launched a new initiative, called the Distressed Neighborhoods Pilot
      Project, to provide funding for high-crime, high-need communities to hire new officers
      through the Justice Department COPS Program. Under the initiative, $106 million in
      grants will be provided to 18 pilot cities to fund 738 new or redeployed officers. The
      communities will be required to deploy these officers in the targeted areas with high
      crime or poverty identified by the cities.

      The grants provided through the initiative will fund 100% ofthe entry-level salary and
      benefits for new law enforcement officers for three years -- waiving the usual local match.
       In addition, the COPS Office will provide a package of assistance including specialized
      training to help cities better address crime in their targeted neighborhoods.

Q.    How much are the cities receiving? How many officers will each city fund?

A.    The cities and totals for grants and officers are as follows:

      Baltimore, MD              100 officers               $10.8 million
      Bessemer, AL               12 officers                $1.2 million
      Birmingham, AL             25 officers                $2.8 million
      Buffalo, NY                20 officers                $2.8 million
      Camden, NJ                 5 officers                 $891,000
      Chicago,IL                 150 officers               $23 million
      Cleveland, OH              100 officers               $15 million
      El Paso, TX                12 officers                $1.4 million
      Flint, MI                  12 officers                $877,122
      Fort Pierce, FL            3 officers                 $318,000
      Fresno, CA                 75 officers                $13.7 million
      Greenville, MS             6 officers                 $493,920
      Hartford, CN               12 officers                $1.5 million
      McAllen, TX                20 officers                $2.2 million
      Miami, FL                  168 officers               $24.2 million
      Monroe, LA                 5 officers                 $393,435
      Muskegon, MI       5 officers                  $609,230
      San Bernardino, CA         8 officers                 $1.6 million

Q.    How were these cities selected?
                                            Hex·Dump Conversion

A.   The Justice Department COPS Office reviewed crime data, previous participation in
     COPS and other Federal programs, and financial hardship. The primary criteria used
     were crime index indicators, unemployment data, and poverty data. The jurisdictions in
     the pilot have some of the highest crime and poverty rates in the nation as compared to
     other cities of similar size.

Q.   Why weren't other cities such as Gary, Indiana, and Nashville -- both of which have
     had increases in crime-- selected?

A.   The pilot cities were chosen based on a careful analysis of several factors -- not just crime
     rates alone. A combination of factors, such as economic distress, crime, unemployment
     and poverty were all considered. Many of the targeted neighborhoods under the
     initiative face some of the most dire circumstances facing any community in America.
     We recognize that the pilot cities are not the only ones facing challenges with respect to
     these criteria, which is why we will look into expanding the initiative in the future. In
     addition, the COPS Office is already working with cities such as Gary and Nashville to
     provide a wide range of community policing assistance and support.

COPS General

Q.   How many of the 75,000 officers whom you've funded are actually on the street?

A.   While the most recent survey of this information by the COPS office will not be
     completed until next month, we do know that more than half of the new officers (40,000)
     have already been hired by local police departments and are on the street.

     The remaining police officers are somewhere in the process of being recruited, screened,
     tested or trained _. a process that can take as long as 18 months. The funds to pay these
     officers are available to local police departments just as soon as they are ready to hire
     their new recruits.

     Equally important, the COPS office expects local law enforcement agencies to use their
     normal rigorous recruiting and hiring procedures in filling all COPS-funded positions. It
     is more important

     (NB: Consistent with the 1994 Crime Act, the Administration has provided funding for
     about 17,000 new officers every year since FY 1995. That means that by the end of this
     year, we should have funded a total of 65, 000 more police -- withjust under 40,000 on
     the street. With more than four months left in the fiscal year, we have already surpassed
     these expectations -- 75,000 funded and over 40,000 on the street.)

Q.   Some have argued that this program is only a short-term fix, and that after three
     years, these officers will either be fired or absorbed through a department's natural
     attrition process. Does the Justice Department have any idea whether these
     communities will actually keep these officers when the 3-year grant period expires?
                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


A.   We are confident that the vast majority of our grantees are planning to retain their
     officers. This was part of the commitment they made in order to receive the federal COPS
     grant. And the reports that the Justice Department has received from the grantees as well
     as some of the research and media stories from across the country confirm it.

     For example, a recent Akron Beacon Journal survey found that 44 out of 45 Northern
     Ohio agencies are planning to retain their officers. The Daily Southtown in Illinois
     reported that all 33 communities in its coverage area that had received grants were
     making plans to retain these officers. In Mississippi, the Biloxi Sun Herald reported that
     Gulf Coast communities planned to retain their officers.

     We understand that there may be some unforeseen circumstances, fiscal emergencies or
     natural disasters that may prevent a department from retaining their COPS-funded
     officers. The COPS Office will work with communities on a case-by-case basis if they
     encounter such difficulties.

     We are also starting to provide assistance for smaller communities with populations
     below 50,000 that are facing unexpected financial hardships. The COPS Small
     Community Grant Program will provide one-time grants for a fourth year of COPS
     funding for some of our smaller grantees to help them make the transition to 100% local
     funding when the grant expires.

COMMUNITY POLICING AND CRIME RATES

Q.   Isn't crime really falling because of aging baby boomers, or the decline in crack
     use? Isn't is just a matter oftime before crime goes back up?

A.   There is no. doubt that community policing and these additional officers have had an
     impact on crime. Police chiefs and sheriffs across the country have consistently credited
     community policing with the gains we have experienced over the last six years in our
     fight against crime. And an increasing number of researchers are also concluding that
     increased police staffing levels and community policing can cause significant reductions
     in crime.

     Demographics do not need to be our destiny. The federal government can help by
     working with police, prosecutors, and community leaders to give them the tools they need
     to make a difference. By working together and taking a balanced approach -- of more
     police, fewer guns on our streets, tougher punishment for violent offenders, and better
     opportunities for our kids -- our efforts are showing results.
