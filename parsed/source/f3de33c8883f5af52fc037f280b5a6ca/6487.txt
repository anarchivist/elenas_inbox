    Feinstein Education Ballot Initiative. Sen. Feinstein sent you a copy of the "Excellence and
    Accountability in Education Act of 1998", a California ballot initiative she has proposed, The
    initiative contains many elements that reflect your own agenda: requiring grade-by-grade
    education standards; ending social promotions and providing mandatory summer school for
    students who do not meet standards; expanding California's existing class size reduction
    program; lengthening the school year; improving teacher quality through such steps as providing
    incentives to recruit well trained new teachers, raising teacher certification requirements and
    rewarding outstanding teachers; and lowering voter approval of school construction bonds from
    2/3 to a simple majority, The initiative would fund these activities through a $1 per pack
    tobacco tax, Despite the attractiveness of the education proposals, we believe that the funding
    proposal contained in the initiative would make it very difficult for you to support.

    Education Opportunity Zones. DPC staff has met with a coalition of education and advocacy
    groups concerned about urban education (e.g., US Conference of Mayors, Council of Great City
    Schools, Urban League, MALDEF, AFT and NEA) to review the details of your Education
    Opportunity Zones proposal. While some raised concerns with the requirement that school
    districts end social promotions, overall the groups are very supportive and are all likely to
    strongly support the initiative. Mike Cohen and Secretary Riley met with Bill Clay earlier this
    week to share the details of your proposal and seek his support. A stafflevel follow-up meeting
    is scheduled for next week. As with the advocacy groups, we expect some resistance to the
    requirement to end social promotions, but otherwise anticipate his support. We expect that the
    legislation will be ready for transmittal to Congress within the next several weeks, and we are
    working on developing a suitable transmittal event.

    Class Size Reduction Initiative. DPC and Education Department staff are consulting with
    education, advocacy and other organizations on the final design of the class size reduction
    initiative. We are paying particular attention to Democratic governors, such as Carper, Miller
    and Chiles, who either have expressed interest in class size reduction, or concerns about our use
    of the tobacco funds. We expect to have legislation drafted on this initiative within the next
    several weeks.
