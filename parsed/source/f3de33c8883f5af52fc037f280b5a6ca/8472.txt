TEXT:
The following is the suggested language for the EEOC letter. As you will
see, it is shorter and more concise than that presented as a draft from
the agency.  If this looks o.k. to you, we would like to get clearance
from EEOC, read it to the Dems., and then decide how best to present it to
the Republicans. We may want to have a WH person accompany Eller). in the
negotiation with Frank. What do you think?


Dear xxx,

You have asked whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
intends to use Fiscal Year 1999 appropriated funds to operate employment
tester programs. We understand this question occurs in the context of
Speaker Gingrich's March 23, 1998 letter.

The FY~9 budget request for the EEOC does not provide for the use of FY99
appropriated funds to operate employment tester programs.



Julie
