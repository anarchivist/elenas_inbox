TEXT:
We've had some trouble picturing Presidential events that focus on our
legal immigrant fix proposals.  Picturing him going to a nursing home with
a bunch of elderly immigrants who are afraid they can't pa.ss the test in
time raises a lot of interesting questions and cross-fire -- our fix
wouldn't help everyone there, the INS waiting time is increasing, there
would be anger that we signed the bill in the first place.   But here's
just a thought:  an event with Giuliani and George Soros, who's giving
money to help the elderly take naturalization classes, would probably get
some play and might come off with some less negative vibes.   I assume
they'd both do it.  I just thought I'd throw it out given the search for
events.
