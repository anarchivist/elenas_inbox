TEXT:
Paul Glastris sent around the memo below describing an idea to launch a
drive to get federal tutors for students in the DC public schools who are
in danger being retained. Several people pointed out that many agencies
already have on-going tutoring efforts -- and that we ought to assess what
current efforts agencies are making in this regard.

Tomorrow, I will meet with the inter-agency group (originally pulled
together by Diana Fortuna)  to get an update on the second-year progress
of federal agencies in meeting service commitments made as part of the
Presidents' Summit for America's Future. At tomorrow's meeting, agencies
will also be providing information on the types of tutoring efforts that
they are involved with in the DC schools.

I don't know what you thought of this idea, but - if it turns out to be
feasible - it could be a sub-part of some service or social promotions
event.

MEMORANDUM        FOR CIRCULATION

FROM:                     PAUL GLASTRIS

RE:                       SOCIAL PROMOTION/VOLUNTEERISM EVENT IDEA FOR
D.C.                      SCHOOLS

        HereD,s an idea that for a newsmaking policy event that would
highlight a key part of our education agenda (ending social promotion
D&the right wa0J8), would cost little, would not require Congressional
approval, and would do some good for the children of D.C. The idea is for
the President or the First Lady to announce a drive to mobilize federal


employees to work as volunteer tutors to D.C. public school students    who
have been, or who are at risk of being, held back a grade because of    the
DistrictD,s new policy of ending social promotion. A possible venue     for
this announcement is the DC D&Literacy SummitD8 on February 25, 1999    (the
President will be traveling that day but the First Lady is in town) .

        Under the new school superintendent Arlene Ackerman, the DC public
schools are now pursuing precisely the policy that the President, in his
SOTU address, called for all schools to follow: end social promotion, but
end it the right way, by giving failing students the extra academic
support they need to meet tough new standards.   In the DC schools, kids
who score too low on end-of-the-year tests must go to summer school and be
drilled in math and reading.  If their test scores still donD,t meet
minimum standards, they are held back.  ThatD,s what happened to 3045
elementary school students last fall.  Now·, Ackerman wants to find
individual tutors for each of those 3045 kids, and for thousands of others
at risk of being held back this year.

        The problem is, there simply arenD,t that many tutors to go
around, especially for the out-of-the-way schools in far Northeast and
Southwest. And even if there were, the DC schools donD,t now have the
personnel to coordinate a vast volunteer tutor program.

        ThatD,s where the federal government can, and should, help. And
fortunately, the Clinton administration has already built a strong base
from which to help.  Three years ago, the administration founded DC Reads
(forerunner of our America Reads program). DC Reads places AmeriCorps
members in the 16 lowest-performing public elementary schools, and uses
those members to coordinate about 250 volunteers to tutor some 500 young
students. Most of those tutors are college students doing work-study.   But
some are federal workers from a few agencies (State, Education, the
Comptroller of the Currency, the Navy Yard) that D&adoptedD8 individual
schools. The State Department, for instance, began mobilizing volunteers
in September of last year and now sends 80 tutors to Miner Elementary
school. An independent evaluation is underway to see if the DC Reads
program actually improves studentsD, performance, but initial signs are
quite good.

        So, hereO,s the plan: have the President announce a three step
plan by which the federal government will help make sure that every young
DC school child who needs a tutor in order not to be held back a grade
gets one.

1--the President issues an executive order requiring every federal agency
to have a point person responsible for mobilizing volunteers within the
agency to tutor DC schoolchildren.  This is a necessary follow-on to
another executive order he issued last April allowing federal workers to
use flexible schedules so that they can do volunteer work during business
hours.  The goal should be to have a set number of civil servant tutors
(say, 1500) by the end of the school year.

 2--the President announces that he is expanding DC Reads so that every
young DC school student has access to a tutoring program. Right now, DC
Reads serves the 16 most needy of DC's 111 elementary schools.   Each of
those 16 schools has 2 AmeriCorps members on site to coordinate the
volunteers, who come from colleges, government agencies, the private
sector, and the neighborhoods. The Corporation for National Service
believes that it may well be possible to do the same job with
only one member per school.  If so, DC Reads could double in size to 32
schools with very little increase in staff and budget.  To cover the whole


    city, many more AmeriCorps members would have to be detailed to this
    program, but the remaining 79 schools could probably be covered with fewer
    than 79 new AmeriCorps members.  Some of those 79 schools are upper-middle
    and don't need the help.  In other cases, programs can be set up in public
    libraries to serve two or more neighborhood schools.  ItO,s unrealistic to
    expect enough federal employee volunteers to meet the huge demand for
    tutoring.  But with AmeriCorps members in every neighborhood, the
    managerial infrastructure would be in place so that if the private sector
    and neighborhoods would do their part and send enough volunteers, every DC
    child who needs a tutor could get one.

    3--The President should announce, if possible, that OC will receive some
    kind of already-appropriated grants for literacy training or after school.
