TEXT:
I'm so glad you are now able to attend the NACW briefing and make
remarks.   The briefing should start at appx. 3:30 p.m. and run until 5:30
p.m.   (depending upon whether Larry Irving will be able to speak at 5:00
p.m. or not, otherwise, it will be over by 5:00 p.m. or thereabouts).
When would you like to speak on the program? Joan Lombardi will be able
to speak anytime during the event as she will be present throughout; and
Eldie Acheson has not give me a preference yet.   Just let me know when you
can stop by for appx. 20-30 minutes and we'll make it work.

Also, could you fax me your bio, please? I want to include it along with
the others in our packets.
Call me if you have any questions at 6-7310. Thanks again for agreeing to
participate!
