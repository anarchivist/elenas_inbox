     AIDS Researcher Hopes for Vaccine

     .c The Associated Press

      BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- American AIDS researcher Robert Gallo has said
     that recent work has raised his confidence that a vaccine can be developed
     against the deadly disease in four years.

     Speaking to Thai researchers Friday at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University,
     Gallo, credited for co-discovering HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, said
     he was more confident of a vaccine than a year ago.

     "Recent researches make me confident that we will have something in the
     form of a preventive vaccine, say, in the coming three or four years, ' ,


Gallo was quoted by The Nation newspaper as saying.

Gallo said recent laboratory studies show that a protein in the urine of
women early in pregnancy can inhibit the replication of HIV virus in the
test tube.

Study on a vaccine is meanwhile under way on 80 volunteers in several
European countries and Israel made by combining interferon, used in
treating Hepatitis B and cancer, with TAT, an HIV-generated protein.

Trials are likely to begin in the United States after it receives approval
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, possibly in February, Gallo was
quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying.

Clinical trials could begin in Thailand after that, he said.

Gallo is a director of the Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore,
Maryland.
