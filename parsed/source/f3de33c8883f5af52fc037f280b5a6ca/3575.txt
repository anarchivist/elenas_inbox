TEXT:
Q:      The Wall Street Journal reports today that the Administration
task force reviewing the settlement will recommend that the President
support it with relatively few changes.   Can you confirm that?

A.      No. The task force reviewing the settlement -- led by Secretary
Shalala and Bruce Reed -- has not yet finished its work or made
recommendations ,to the President. The President has personally reached a
final conclusion on only one part of the settlement: the requirement that
the FDA find that there will not be a black market before mandating any
product changes. That is an unreasonable requirement, which will too
greatly limit the FDA's ability to make tobacco products safer or less
addictive.
