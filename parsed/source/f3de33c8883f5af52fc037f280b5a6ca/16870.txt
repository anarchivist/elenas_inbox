    Dear Governor - - - - -

           The continuing explosion of new technologies gives us a groundbreaking
    opportunity to work together to link our federal and state law enforcement efforts
    in ways we never thought possible even a few years ago. For example, we are
    now able to track the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders to prevent them
    from committing new crimes. If we begin now to coordinate our efforts, I am
    convinced that American public safety will benefit significantly.

            From the historic 1994 Crime Act through the Interstate Compact on
    Criminal History Records that I will soon submit to Congress, my Administration
    has strived to pass legislation to harness computers and other technology for the
    public good. Many of our states' governors have played crucial roles in fighting
    to pass this legislation, and I thank you again for that assistance. Although these
    laws are an important foundation for federal and state cooperation, the new
    technologies can do only what we commit them to do, and we still need to do
    much more -- including exchanging criminal records between states for
    employment checks on workers in occupations that deal with children, and using
    incident-based crime reports to help police solve specific types of repeated crime,
    such as church arson or serial murder. Federal and state governments must forge
    a close partnership to realize the full potential of these new technologies. I am
    prepared to take actions to intensifY our federal efforts in the coming months, but I
    will need your help in order to ensure our success in several initiatives.

            In June of 1996, I directed the Attorney General to develop a national
    sexual predator and child molester registration system to link the sex offender
    registration and notification systems being developed in all 50 states. The
    Interim national sex-offender registry became operational earlier this year, and the
    Attorney General recently wrote to enlist your assistance. I arn encouraged that
    ten states have already loaded their infonnation onto the system, with many of you
    pledging to do so within the next few months. I am grateful for any help you can
    provide in making this national sex offender registration system a reality. To
    move further ahead, I am directing the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense
    today to take steps to expand the national sex-offender registry to include
    convicted sex offenders being released from federal and military facilities.

            Next month, I will submit to Congress an Interstate and Federal-State
    Compact to facilitate the exchange of criminal records by establishing an FBI
    index of state-maintained criminal infonnation that states can consult along with
    the National Fingerprint File. The Compact would standardize policies for
    sharing of criminal records for purposes such as pre-employment background
    checks. It would improve access to criminal records and save the states and the
    federal government money by avoiding duplication of effort. I hope I can count
    on your support of the Compact as it moves through your State legislature.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
        Many Federal laws --including the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System --include
provisions to help states automate and improve their criminal records, especially
to block handgun sales to prohibited gun purchasers. The Department of
Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) stands ready to help states reach this
goal through the National Criminal History Improvement Program. BJS has
already awarded more than $112 million to states, with a total of $226 million
authorized. I urge your State to take full advantage of this program.

         As you know, the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program gives us data
that help us measure our progress in reducing crime. The next generation ofUCR,
the National Incident-Based Reporting System, will usher in a new era of crime
data -- so that we can tell that a crime was a hate crime, an incident of domestic
abuse, or a crime directed at a child. Such information will help law enforcement
agencies identifY local and national trends, and lead to quicker arrests of violent
offenders. The Justice Department is working with states, counties, and cities to
expand the NIBRS. I hope that you will lend your support to this effort.

         With your State's active participation, we can make significant progress in
all of these initiatives. I look forward to working with you to achieve our mutual
goal -- using new technologies to make America safer for all our citizens.

Sincerely,

                                      #1#1##
