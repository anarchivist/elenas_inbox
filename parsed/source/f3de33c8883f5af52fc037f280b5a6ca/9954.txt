PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON BRADY LAW
WASHINGTON, DC
November 6, 1998

        Good morning. This week, the American people sent a clear message
to Washington that we must put politics aside and take real action on the
real challenges facing our nation: saving Social Security for the 21st
century ... passing a PatientsD, Bill of Rights ... and strengthening our
schools by finishing the job of hiring 100,000 teachers, and passing my
plan to build or modernize 5,000 schools across the country.

        Over the past 6 years, we have taken real action to address
another important challenge: making our communities safe for our


families.  For too long, it seemed as if rising crime was a frightening
fact of life in America. In too many communities, children could not play
on the street or walk to school in safety ... older Americans locked
themselves into their homes in fear ... and gangs armed with illegal guns
boldly roamed our streets and schools.

        I took office determined to change this.  We committed ourselves
to a comprehensive anti-crime strategy based more community policing,
tougher penalties, and better prevention.   Today, our strategy is showing
remarkable results.  We're ahead of schedule and under budget in meeting
our goal of putting 100,000 police on the street. All across America
crime rates have fallen to a 25-year low -- and respect for the law is on
the rise.  Families are beginning to feel safe in their communities
again.

        Keeping guns out of the hands of criminals has been at the center
of our strategy -- and an essential part of our success.   Since I signed
the Brady Bill into law, background checks have put a stop to more than a
quarter million handgun purchases by fugitives and felons.   Law
enforcement officers from around the country have told us that fewer guns
on the streets have made a huge difference in the lives of the families
they serve.

         At the end of this month, we will make the Brady law even
stronger. For the first time ever, we will require background checks for
the purchase of any firearm -- handguns, rifles, and shotguns -- no matter
where they are purchased -- from a licensed gun dealer or a pawn shop.
Under this new D&Insta-CheckD8 system, as it is called, we will be able to
run nearly four times as many background checks -- most in a matter of
minutes.

        We have spent five years working with state and local law
enforcement to put this system in place.  But when it comes to our
familiesD, safety, we must take another important step.

        Every year, an untold number of firearms are bought and sold at an
estimated 5,000 gun shows around the country.  I come from a state where
these shows are very popular, and I have visited and enjoyed them over the
years. They are often the first place parents teach their children how to
handle firearms safely, and I know that most gun dealers are dedicated to
promoting safe, legal gun use.

         But at too many gun shows, a different, dangerous trend is
emerging. Because the law permits legitimate, private collectors to buy
guns without background checks, unlicensed gun dealers are slipping into
the system and selling guns on a cash-and-carry, no-questions-asked
basis. All too often, their customers are criminals, who depend on these
dealers to supply them with the guns they cannot buy any other way.

        On Tuesday, the people of Florida voted overwhelmingly to put a
stop to these tainted transactions and make it harder for criminals to buy
firearms.  Under the new law, all gun sellers -- licensed or unlicensed,
professional dealer or part-time collector -- must conduct background
checks for every gun they sell.

         I believe this should be the law of the land: no background check,
no gun, ·no exceptions. Today, I am directing Secretary Rubin and Attorney
General Reno to report back to me in 60 days with the best way to close
the loophole in the law and prohibit any gun sale without a background
check. We did not fight as hard as we did to pass the Brady law only to


let a handful of unscrupulous gun dealers disrespect our laws, undermine
our progress, and put the safety of our families at risk. with this
action, we are one step closer to shutting the~ down.

        I look forward to working together with members of both parties in
the new Congress to meet this challenge, and to build a safer and stronger
America for the 21st Century.

       Thanks for listening.
