      FYI: On Thursday, September 24, the President is scheduled to meet with
      the Congressional Black Caucus. There are several issues, taken from the
      ten point placard for the CBC Legislative Conference, that they will
      likely raise with their meeting with the President.   I would appreciate
      your assistance with background and talking points which our office will
      need to put together the President's briefing paper. Please provide a
      brief paragraph along with two or three talking points for the following
      issues by 12:00pm on Monday:
