TEXT:
Crime Team:

 FYI -- I just heard from Treasury that they are doing an emergency
 impromptu press conference on their interim taggants report.  It seems
 that NAS (the National Academy of Sciences), to whom ATF had contracted
part of the taggants study, was planning to do a press conference on the
"Hill tomorrow morning, and Treasury though it'd be better for Ray Kelly to
 get ahead of NAS and talk to press tonight.  I'm unclear as to why things
 turned out this way, and hope to know more by tomorrow's crime meeting.
 In the meantime, I thought I should circulate a note and let everyone know
 -- in case it makes any news.

Jose'
