                              Remarks as prepared for delivery by
                        U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley
              regarding school safety and the tragedy at Columbine High School


Good afternoon. Today is a day of grief and suffering for all Americans in light of the great
tragedy that has occurred in Littleton, Colorado.

Like all Americans I extend my prayers to the many, many families in Littleton who are suffering
today.

As the father of 4 children and the grandfather of 10 children, my heart goes out to each and
every one of these families and to the teachers, faculty and staff at Columbine High School.

This tragedy represents a new scale and level of school violence that we have never seen before.
And it says something about the easy ability of young people to get access to guns. If this type of
tragedy doesn=t bring about a public outcry I don=t know what will.

My message to every gun owner in America is very direct .- lock up your guns today. Think hard
about what has just happened and please don=t assume anything. This is not an issue of being
pro-gun or anti-gun. The issue here is the safety of children. Time and again, the young people
who have caused these types of tragedies have been able to get access to guns. America needs to
realize that kids and unsupervised gun use do not mix.

My message to parents is to reach out to your children and listen to them. We have to do
everything we can to connect even to the most angry and alienated young person. Young people
who are cut off and isolated can be, as we have seen, deeply disconnected.

I urge parents to slow down their lives. As a society we must make much more of an effort to
help families, to make sure that there is some responsible adult in the life of every young person
_. even the most alienated and angry young person.

My message to the young people of South Carolina and all across America is to think hard about
what has happened because this concerns you and your friends. If you are worried and concerned
about a friend who is becoming disconnected and isolated please contact an adult who can help
you help your friend before it is too late.

At the beginning of this school year, at the instruction of the president, a copy of the "Early
                                                      2                         Automatea Records Management System
                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
     Warning Guide" was sent to every school superintendent and principal in the country. I ask
     every principal and educator in South Carolina to take out a copy of this "Early Warning Guide:::
     and read it again. This guide was written by a group of national experts
     and it is based on sound research.

     The guide places a strong emphasis on prevention and gives educators and teachers a clear
     understanding of the 16 warning signs that can help school officials prevent tragedies similar to
     Littleton. This guide must be used in a responsible manner and schools must not use it to over-
     label and stereotype a few individual children .. Our national experts, who have holding
     workshops all across the country, stand ready to assist you.

     As you will note in the cover letter for this AGuide,::: which was signed by the Attorney General
     Janet Reno and myself, one of the the key insights of this document is that keeping children safe
     is a community wide effort. This is why we will be sending out an additional 100,000 copies to
     community groups, PTA=s and PTO=s, faith communities and other concerned citizens.
     There is no single answer to this type of tragedy and we should not look for one. Every level of
     society -- from community groups, to schools, to faith communities, state officials and national
     leaders -- can contribute to supporting families as they seek to raise their children safely.

     I urge all concerned citizens to become involved in helping to make our schools safer. Copies of
     this AGuide::: can be found on our website at www.ed.gov and are also available free of charge
     by calling 1-800-USA-LEARN.

     In addition to the AGuide::: other federal efforts to improve school safety include a new $300
     million comprehensive school violence prevention initiative, and a proposal to the Congress to
     establish AProject SERV::: -- a $12 million effort to help school districts that have to confront
     these types of tragedies.

     I will be happy to answer any questions.

                                                       ###
