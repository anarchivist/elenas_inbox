MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                       Bruce Reed
                            Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                    DPC Weekly Report

           Tohacco: Medicaid Recoupment: Despite efforts by Senators Harkin, Durbin, and
Spectcr, 011 Thursday the Senate Appropriations Committee added to the supplemental
approj.1I"iations bill the Hutchison bill which lets states keep all tobacco settlement funds
wi IhOll t any conunitment to use the federal share to prevent youth smoking, protect tobacco
farmers, promote public health, or assist children. Before the min-kup, the Chainnan of the
Finance Committee, Senator Roth, sent a letter to Senator Styvctts saying Appropriations
COl1ll11itlcc action on the Hutchison bill would "bypass the, jurisdiction of the Finance
Committee" and that the bill "has enonncius ramifications f6~ the Medicaid program and
should be thoughtfully considered through the committee process,.~i:,.'He. noted the amendment
                                                                  ..    ~'"

w:!s not p:lid [Ot' and urged the committee, if it was compelled t9,,~~t, to prevent recoupment
OJ.: y ill 1909 or 2000 to give the Finance Committee time to act. '. "J:he Hutchison bill now has
40 co-sponsors, including 9 Democrats (many of whom say they Wb~ld be willing to accept an
                                                                  , <.' ,"    ~
alternati\'c along the lines we've proposed). While we continue to;j1rge;tl}e Congress to adopt
a 111casure which ensures the federal share is used to promote pi.i1)Ji,ch.ea~th, assist children and
protect f:nmers, we recommend we issue a veto threat to underscore' our opposition to the
Hutcll!s:)Il111easure.                                               .,      ;

          Tobacco -- New Evidence Confirms Higher Taxes Reduce 'Smoking: Two new
stl ,lies show cigarette sales declined sharply in Alaska and Oregon after the states instituted
hio:!icr wb,lcco taxes. In October 1997, Alaska tripled its tax,'from$.29 to $1.00 a pack,
raisins thc rei ail price of cigarettes by 39 percent to $3.14 a pack. The next year, tobacco
sa:cs deciincli' 17 percent from 1995 and 1996 levels and average monthly tobacco tax
CQ,:cctions increased from $l.5 to $4.3 million per month. Moreover, the state found no
e,idcilCC 0 i' iilcreased smuggling or crime.                               .
          Gl'cgoll raised its tax by $.30 per pack in February 1997, increasing cigarette prices by
 l() perc'::]I, :1I1d devoted 10 percent of the proceeds for tobacco-use prevention programs.
'[C:1:ICC" s:des in 1997 and 1998 fell 11.3 percent compared to 1993-1996 levels, The
al ;.ly"i5. by the .Centers for Disease Control and the Oregon Health Division, found that this
cc :1lp'C~1l'11Sivc approach of a price increase plus prevention prograIns had a much bigger
eF'.:cl lb:; :1 price increase alone. Most studies of price increases have found that every 10
pc .:cnt : ;:':'e~,se in price will reduce overall smoking by about 4 percent. (the effect is higher
for )'llll':i -- about 7 percent) -- essentially the effects found in Alaska. According to this

m0Lic I, a 16 pcrcent price increase in Oregon should have resulted in a 6.3 percent decrease in
CO'1sul11l'lion, not the 11.3 actually achieved. The CDC attributes the higher smoking
reduction rates to the state's $8.5 million a year tobacco use prevention program which fupded
COll1l1lLluity-based tobacco-use prevention coalitions in every county, a statewide public
mvarcncss and education campaign, comprehensive school-based programs, tribal tobacco-use
pr;vcntiOI1 programs, multicultural outreach and education, a quitters' help line providing
smoking cessation support, and projects evaluating new approacl1es to prevent or reduce
t011<1CCO lise. Nearly all (93 percent) of the program's' funds Were .. awarded in grants or
CO:1tr~lcts outside state government (~, county health departments, community-based
ag ·ncies. tribal governments, private sector agencies implementing public' awareness
call1p~if'Il). These findings bolster the rationale for ensuring that states use at least part of
their ::cl'1c:ncllt on tobacco use prevention.
