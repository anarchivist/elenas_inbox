    KIDS AND GUNS =YOUTH VIOLENCE. The mix of kids and guns is at the
    heart of our nation's youth violence epidemic. Guns -- and handguns in
    particular -- have fueled the surge in juvenile murders. Since 1984, the
    number of kids killing with a gun has quadrupled. And teenage boys
    today are more likely to die of gun shot wounds than all natural causes
    combined.      Juvenile crime legislation passed by Congress must address
    this issue.

*   ADMINISTRATION BILL IS TOUGH ON GUNS.          It takes on the issue of kids
    and guns by: (1) increasing penalties for illegally transferring guns to
    juveniles; (2) expanding the Brady Law to prohibit violent juveniles from
    owning guns as adults; and (3) requiring federal gun dealers to provide
    child safety locks with every gun sold.

*   WE CAN -- AND SHOULD -- DO MORE. Although we need Congress to
    act, there's more we can -- and should -- do to cut off the easy access to
    guns for our kids. In most circumstances, existing law (youth Handgun
    Safety Act) already prohibits adults from transferring handguns to
    juveniles(punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment) -- and kids from
    possessing them, period (mandatory probation). For almost every gun
    that gets into a juvenile's hands, an adult had an opportunity -- in fact, the
    legal responsibility -- to stop that transfer from taking place.

*   THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTIVE: PUTTING ADULT GUN PURCHASERS ON NOTICE.
    Our directive on juvenile handguns ensures that our Administration and
    Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs)are doing everything possible to put adult
    gun purchasers on notice about their responsibilities -- under current law --
    to help keep handguns away from our kids. The directive calls for all FFLs
    to post signs and issue written warnings with each handgun sold that:

          (1) Make clear that it is generally illegal for any adult to transfer a
          handgun to a minor (under 18), or for that minor to possess a
          handgun, period;

          (2)Make clear that violators of this law will be prosecuted;

          (3) Warn that handguns are a leading cause of juvenile fatalities;
          and

          (4) Suggest that safely storing and locking handguns can help
          ensure compliance with this law.
