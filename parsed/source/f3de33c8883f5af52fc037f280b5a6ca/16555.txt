TEXT:
Attached is a revised response to Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard of
California, who wrote to Erskine asking us to support the Senate domestic
violence provision in the budget act.

Elena -- you had wanted me to include a statement that he's asked Bruce
Reed to make himself available to meet with her to discuss this issue.
Sally Katzen's office tells me that kind of conversation is verboten once
OMB gets the draft regs.  If there were to be a meeting, it should involve
all the concerned members of Congress and Sally as well, and should be a
listening session to hear their views (we're not supposed to reveal what's
in the draft reg). Sally did hold such a broad-scale meeting on PM ozone
issue, but it's rare.

Sally is on Cape Cod at the moment; her deputy Don Arbuckle is here if we
have more questions.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

    DRAFT REPLY TO CONGRESSWOMAN LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD
    FROM ERSKINE BOWLES



           Thank you for writing to me about the Family Violence Option that was in the Senate
    version of the budget reconciliation bill. As you know, the conferees did not include the
    provision in the final version of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

            The Department of Health and Human Services has drafted regulations on this and other
    issues relating to the implementation of the new welfare law and recently submitted them to the
    Office of Management and Budget for review. We plan to take your comments into
    consideration as part of this review.

           Thank you again for letting us know of your concerns.
