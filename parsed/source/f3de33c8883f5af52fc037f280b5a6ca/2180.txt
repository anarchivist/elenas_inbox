       Today, the House of Representatives is missing an important opportunity to fight and
prevent the scourge of juvenile crime. I oppose passage of H.R. 3, the Juvenile Crime Control
Act, because it fails to provide a comprehensive plan to crack down on youth and gang violence.

         As I began my second term as President, I made juvenile crime and gangs my top law
enforcement priority over the next four years. I called on very police officer, prosecutor, and
citizen in America to work together to keep our young people safe and young criminals off our
streets.

         My Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy declares war on gangs, with a requirement
that dealers sell child safety locks with firearms, to protect our kids from using guns to hurt each
other or hurt themselves; targeted funding for additional local prosecutors to pursue, prosecute
and punish gang members; a Brady Law extension so violent teen criminals will never have the
right to purchase a gun; and targeted resources to keep schools open late, on weekends, and in the
summer, so young people have something to say yes to.

       H.R. 3 fails to provide any of these necessary measures to give law enforcement,
prosecutors, and families the tools they need to combat gangs and youth violence in their
communities.

      Four. years ago, we made a commitment to take our streets back from crime and violence.
 We had a comprehensive plan of 100,000 new community police officers on the street, tough
new penalties on the books and keeping guns out of the hands of criminals with the assault
weapons ban and the Brady Bill.

        Our plan is working. Last year, violent crime came down for the fifth year in a row. And
for the first time in seven years, the rate of young people arrested for violent crime and murder
has gone down. But we cannot waste this opportunity to bring down violent juvenile crime even
further. I will continue to work with Congress to ensure passage of legislation that will give our
children the safest and most secure future as possible.
