TEXT:
I realized that the sheet you all have has one more problem, which I've
corrected:

It read that Shaw was not "restoring" benefits to those in the US on 8/96
who "are -- or will in the future become -- disabled". This is wrong
because he is nice to people who were already on the rolls.    The people he
is hurting are those in the US on that date "who become disabled." So it
will read "fails to protect ... benefits for legal immigrants who were in
the US as of 8/96 and become disabled."

Otherwise, I've signed off.
