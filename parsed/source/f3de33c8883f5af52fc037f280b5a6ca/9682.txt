PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON THE BUDGET
THE WHITE HOUSE
October 10, 1998

        Good morning.  In the next few days, Congress can make enormous
progress to renew and strengthen our schools, as it completes work on the
budget. There is no more critical task for our nation.

        Ten days ago, we closed the books on our fiscal year -- and yet
Congress still has not opened the books for the fiscal year at hand.
Last night, for the second time in two weeks, I signed stop-gap
legislation to keep our government running.  But I cannot keep granting
extensions indefinitely.  For Members of Congress, school is almost out.

        And frankly, the American people deserve better. This is a year
when we should be able to make real, bipartisan progress. We have created
the first balanced budget and surplus in 29 years. Our economy continues
to create jobs and broaden prosperity, despite economic turmoil abroad.
We must use this moment of good fortune to make an historic investment in
the quality of our public schools.
  ·

         In recent days Congress has chosen progress over partisanship by passing
a higher education bill that will help millions of Americans afford
college.  For the first time in our history, because of tax cuts, expanded
scholarships, and lower student loan rates we have enacted over the past
six years, every American can afford to go to college.

        We know our colleges are the best in the world.  Now we must work
with the same resolve to make our elementary and secondary schools the
best in the world.

        This budget should help our children learn in smaller classes.  It
should make a strong down payment on our drive to hire 100,000 new highly
qualified teachers to reduce class size in early grades.

         It should modernize our schools so that every child has a chance
to learn in classrooms that are modern, safe, and wired for the 21st
Century. This budget should include targeted tax cuts to help communities
build or modernize 5,000 schools. And it should bring cutting-edge
technology to the classroom, and make sure that teachers are trained to
use "it.

         It should fund innovative charter schools, so that parents and
teachers can bring the benefits of choice and competition to our public
schools.

         It should fully fund after-school programs, so young people learn
their lessons in the classroom, not the streets ... expand Head Start for
the early years ... and insist on high standards in the basics.   It fund
our childhood literacy programs so that every child will be able to read
independently by the 3rd grade. And it should support our new mentoring
drive to encourage young people to go to college.

        Small classes, trained teachers, modern schools, high standards,
public school choice and more. This is the plan that can revolutionize
education in America.  But the Republican majority in Congress hasnO,t
even brought the education investment bill to a vote. When it comes to
education, Congress canO,t get an O+incomplete.O,  I ask the Republicans
in Congress to put progress over partisanship and send me a full education
investment bill.

        Remember:  this is the last complete budget of the 20th century.
We cannot pass up this golden opportunity to invest wisely for our
children and for the next the American century -- the century that will be
theirs. Thanks for listening.
