      TEXT:
      FYI: USDA sent us and OMB paper outlining the options for allowing states
      to count food stamp toward work wages for families with kids under age 6.
      Elena, the options are as Bonnie O'Neil laid out to us verbally:

              1) Advise states they can use the Simplied Food Stamp option to
      import TANF rules -- such as work requirements -- into the Food Stamp
      program for dual eligible individuals.  Downside: could alert states that
      they could adopt TANF's less restrictive worker protections in the food
      stamp program.

                2) Notify states that USDA will grant waivers to exclude
      able-bodied recipients from food stamp workfare exemptions. Downside:
      states will have certain reporting requirements because of the
      "experimental" nature of the waiver (some of these could perhaps be
      waived) ;

              3) Propose legislation to require able-bodied TANF recipients to
      participate in workfare.  Downside: could encourage Congress to legislate
      a different solution such as a subminimum wage.

      Next steps -- let me know what you think:

              1) I will ask OMB to examine which waiver requirements they would
      feel comfortable exempting so we could see how "painless" we could make
      the waiver option;

              2) I will ask USDA to prepare (if they haven't already)
      legislative language so we'll have it ready;

                 3) Then, we will need to choose:

                      a) We could simply inform states of their options.   This
      will allow us to play the "honest broker" informing states of our
      interpretation of the law;

                      b) We could suggest a particular intermediate step for
      states (either Simplified Program or waiver) and push for legislation as
      the longer-term solution.

                      c) We could suggest either Simplified Food or waiver and
      not push for legislation but share legislative language with others who
      want to do so.



                d) We could suggest either Simplified Food or waiver and
not push for legislation but wait and see what happens in the Senate.
