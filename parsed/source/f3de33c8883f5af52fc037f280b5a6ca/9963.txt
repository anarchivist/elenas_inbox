      COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT INITIATIVES

      Access to Capital and Credit

      1. CDFI Tax Credit. We are looking at a proposal to extend tax incentives to encourage
      investment in CDFls, which would leverage additional private investment in distressed areas and
      stimulate the economic revitalization of those areas. Under the proposal, $100 million in
      non-refundable tax credits would be made available to the CDFI Fund to allocate among equity
      investors in qualified CDFls using a competitive process. One downside with this proposal is
      that it would neither assist non-profit CDFls nor those that issue stock, such as mutual
      organizations.

      2. Microcredit Initiative. We are working to identify means to amplify Administration
      support for microenterprise finance -- both domestically and internationally. We are examining
      whether to build on Senators Kennedy's and Domenici's PRIME legislation which would
      provide technical assistance to microenterprise. We are also looking at increased funding for
      CDFI initiatives specifically targeted to microenterprise, and CRA and other regulatory reform
      designed to enhance bank lending to microenterprise funds. On the international side, we are
      looking at whether we can increase microenterprise funding for USAID or through MDBs (either
      as a direct appropriation or potentially more innovative means, e.g., "debt for development"
      swaps), some portions of which may come under the aegis of support for countries hardest hit by
      the financial crisis.

      Creating Jobs/Making Work Pay

      1. Clean Water, Parks, and Communities Bonds. We are examining three potential
      proposals to encourage "green" infrastructure projects. The first model uses the same financing
      mechanism as your school construction proposal for a menu ofprojects: protecting and
      improving water quality; cleanup of contaminated sediments; waterfront reclamation and
      revitalization; stormwater runoff control; purchasing of green spaces to prevent sprawl; park
      enhancements and revitalization, and brownfields cleanup. The second model, which provides a
      smaller incentive than the first model, would create new tax-exempt bond authority for these
      state and local areas to invest in clean water, parks, and communities. The advantage ofthis
      model is that it builds on the current system of bond finance. The final model would allocate tax
      credits (like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit) to states and local areas to provide to the
      developers of these green infrastructure projects.

      2. Re-Develop 10,000 Abandoned Buildings. Abandoned buildings are a symbol of urban
      blight and an action plan to tum this around will be a powerful signal of change. We are
      examining different proposals to help re-develop 10,000 abandoned buildings, combining several
      existing programs or providing grants or tax incentives to spur private-sector redevelopment of
      these sites.

      3. Employment Tax Credits. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the
      Welfare-To-Work Tax Credit (WTW) will expire on June 30,1999. We believe that the credits

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
there when they file their taxes. Therefore, we are considering whether to make these two tax
credits permanent.


Affordable Housing and Promoting Homeownership for All Americans

1. Expansion of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Last year, you proposed a 40-percent
expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) to spur the private-sector to develop
more affordable rental housing for low-income Americans. However, Congress failed to act
despite large bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. We recommend you
re-propose increasing the cap on the LIHTC from $l.25 per capita to $l.75 per capita. This
proposal would restore the value of the credit to its 1986 level and will help develop an
additional 150,000-180,000 affordable housing units over the next five years. This proposal
would cost $1.6 billion over five years.

2. Homeownership Tax Credit. We are examining two different types of tax credits to
promote homeownership among lower-income families, who generally do not benefit from the
mortgage interest deduction. The first proposal would use the model of the Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit to create a Low-Income Homeownership Tax Credit. Under this proposal,
low-income families would receive a low- or zero-interest second mortgage, which would reduce
their up front costs (e.g., downpayment and closing costs) and investors would receive tax credits
in return. The second proposal is a $5,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers in Empowerment
Zones or Enterprise Communities. (The 1997 Balanced Budget Act included a similar proposal
for first-time homebuyers in the District of Columbia.)

3. Expansion of Private Activity Bond Cap/Mortgage Revenue Bonds. Within their
volume cap, states and local government may issue tax-exempt bonds for a variety of purposes.
State and local governments use about one-third of their private activity bond allocation for
mortgage revenue bonds (MRBs), which helps state and local areas provide below-market
mortgages to first-time homebuyers with relatively low incomes. The volume cap on private
activity bonds, and thus MRBs, has not changed since 1986. Most community development
groups view private activity bonds as yours, since you were the one who permanently extended it
in 1993. If Congress acts this year to increase the cap -- which is likely since it is supported by
a majority of both houses -- we are concerned that you may lose this issue as one of your
legacies. Therefore, we are looking to accelerate the increase in the cap that was included in this
year's budget agreement. Treasury estimates that a 50-percent increase in 2000 -- which would
restore its value to its 1986 level -- would cost $500 million over five years.

4. Incremental Tenant-based Section 8 Vouchers. In order to build on the success of
securing new incremental vouchers last year, we recommend seeking an additional 50,000
welfare-to-work housing vouchers and another 25,000 units to meet the needs of the homeless,
including elderly homeless and homeless veterans.

5.   Regional Affordable Housing Initiative. We are examining whether to propose a

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

        Regional Affordable Housing Initiative (RAHI) as a competitive pilot program. This proposal
        would be designed to result in a more balanced distribution of affordable housing across
        participating metropolitan regions. In particular, the program seeks to increase the availability
        of affordable housing in areas with high growth in low-skilled jobs and inadequate supplies of
        housing for low-income workers. This proposal could be funded through HUD's HOME
        program and would cost $125 million over five years.

        6. Elderly Housing Initiative. This proposal includes a three-pronged approach to tackle the
        needs for elderly housing. This initiative would provide new capital to improve the quality of
        elderly housing, meet the changing needs of elderly residents and provide an alternative to
        nursing home care -- such as assisted living. One interesting part of this initiative would be to
        provide housing vouchers targeted specifically to very-low income elderly who live in
        Low-Income Housing Tax Credit developed housing. Because the tax credit helps subsidize
        rent, this proposal would allow us to leverage our resources and provide more vouchers to the
        poor elderly.

        FINANCIAL SERVICES INITIATIVES

        1. Consumer Financial Literacy and Education. We are currently developing a set of
        proposals to promote consumer financial awareness and enhance consumer credit literacy,
        ranging from a public awareness campaign to establishing an educational clearinghouse to
        disseminate quality curricula to high school students. We are also working on a study to
        identify what the biggest problems are with how Americans use consumer credit, and what
        basic banking services and steps they can take to help themselves (this may be very
        important if bankruptcy reform is a live item next year). Part of our focus is on reaching
        out to low-income households, building on (and expanding) two existing government
        programs -- Treasury's Electronic Funds Transfer program that was a first step in helping
        the "unbanked" enter into electronic commerce and a USDA extension program that is
        providing some (limited) services to rural low-income families. This proposal would cost
        $5-10 million.

        2. Consumer Financial Bill of Rights. In order to respond to the outrage consumers feel
        about ATM surcharges, without supporting economically questionable regulation of ATM
        fees, we are considering a proposal either for the government or for financial institutions
        voluntarily to make publicly available a list of basic banking services and fees on an
        individual or geographic basis to be published periodically over the Internet. The services
        profiled would include, but would not be limited to, charges for access to ATMs. We are
        also considering the adequacy of current credit card disclosure requirements (again,
        relevant to bankruptcy reform) and other areas where information about financial service
        arrangements would be helpful to consumers. This would cost $3-5 million.

                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
