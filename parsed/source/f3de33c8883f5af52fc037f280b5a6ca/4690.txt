TEXT:
By my count, there are currently five types of tobacco farmer approaches
floating around: tobacco companies promise to buy for 25 years; a
legislative buy-out of quotas; a legislative gaurantee not to alter the
existing program; a legislative subsidy to encourage the growing of
alternative crops; and a commission inside USDA. We seemed to favor the
first.  Lugar has suggested the second.  Some farmer representatives have
recommended the third. Anti-smoking groups and some farmers the fourth.
Others the fifth.

Absent our involvement, there is some reason to believe that the farmer
state representatives may coalecse around a proposal that has a
legislative guarantee with a legislative buy-out option. This might be
fine (although costly) but it would be inconsistent with the companies
promising to buy for 25 years. I'll ask OMB to cost the Lugar option out
($8 a pound) .

In any case, the high level of interest in this topic suggests some
position will start to form soon if they sense a vacumn.  I suggest we
have our meeting with legislators soon to make sure we stay a part of it
and don't get caught on the wrong side of a proposal we don't agree with
but which has already gotten substantial backing.

The choices regarding the meeting I see are:
* Who hosts? (POTUS, VPOTUS, Bruce/Donna)
*who comes? (Legislators, or legislators plus farmer leaders, or possibly
adding some Governors to the mix)
*What's said? I think if we do the meeting relatively soon, we can still
be soliciting input and discussing process (staying in touch), and hearing
about options.

Any thoughts on these questions?
Regards, Tom
