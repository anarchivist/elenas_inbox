TEXT:
We have made some changes in the conference room to make it more
comfortable, useful, and presentable.

1) There is now a refrigerator in the conference room with sodas.   These
sodas are for guests attending meetings in the Conference Room.   Please


help keep the refrigerator stocked.

2) We have replaced the old chairs in the room with what are hopefully
more comfortable and bigger chairs.  These chairs are courtesy of Chris
and Jeanine.

3) There will be additional changes.

Please help keep the conference room clean, as we all must share it.
After meetings, please make certain the room is presentable for the next
group of visitors.  Thanks.
