TEXT:
Do you know yet if we are going to release the WTW plan, rework it, send
up principles to the Hill, or something else? Since the SOTU, I've been
fielding a flood of calls on this from both the agencies and outside
people/groups.   I've managed to avoid saying much of anything on it, but
outside pressure for definitive direction from the Administration is
mount.ing. Also, many folks are proceeding on the assumption that what was
released at the Convention is the plan, and they are mounting their
attacks accordingly (particularly two of our favorites:  Bob Greenstein
and Wendall Primus).

Any advice?
