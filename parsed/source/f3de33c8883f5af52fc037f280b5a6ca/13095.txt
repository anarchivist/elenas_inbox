     Next Monday, September 25, the President will participate in a
     Sperling Lunch.
     This event is named for Godfrey "Budge" Sperling of the Christian
     Science Monitor. Sperling has held over 2,600 Sperling
     Breakfasts/Lunches. The luncheon guests consist of approximately
     55 prominent Washington journalists, including bureau chiefs and
     syndicated columnists.  The first hour of the lunch will be in a
     question-and-answer format, and the topics of discussion are not
     restricted.
     Therefore, we need to prepare Qs-and-As as we would for a regular
     press conference, on only a slightly lesser scale.  The Qs-and-As
     you prepared for today's Westwood One radio interview will be a
     good start. The difference is that instead of taking questions
     from a wide range of audience listeners, the President will be
     taking questions from studied journalists whose questions will be
     more political.
     In preparation for this forum, please e-mail and get a hard copy
     of the Qs-and-As to me tomorrow (Friday, sept. 22) by 2:00pm.
     Please call me questions x62712, and let me know if you need to
     see a sample of the specific Q-and-A format Staff Secretary now
     requires. Thanks.
