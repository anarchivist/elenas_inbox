TEXT:
Elena, I put a paragraph together that is located on the h drive at
h:\weekly1.scw.   I did not put a heading on it.  You can do it as factual
and neutral:  INS to publish new disability and naturalization regs.

Or you can do the eye-grabbing alert: New Administration Regs Preclude
Citizenship For Some Severely Disabled    Benefits Remain at Risk Without
Legislative Fix.

I'll let you decide.   Thanks and let me know if you want anything else.
