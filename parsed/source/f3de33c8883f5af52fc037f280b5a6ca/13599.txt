Re: LRM 4243 (Magnuson fishery act) I have some concerns reo section 108 which
contains some ethics provisions (maintains Fishery Management Councils'
exclusion from the ethics statutes -- for no good reason).  Please do not clear
for our office until I have had a chance to discuss with Commerce and OGE.
Thanks.
