TEXT:
It incorporates all the agreements we made with DOL, except that it
modifies the "because" language to reflect the compromise Treasury worked
out with the IRS.  I will fax copies to Cynthia and Bill, and to Marvin
Krislov as well. Not as bad as I feared a few hours ago, but DOL may
still perceive as back-sliding off on Friday's deal.  Bill, what do you
think?

Here's the compromise (most relevant language in italics):

Language DOL loved that the IRS balked at:
"Because this ruling is based on the general welfare doctrine and assumes
that a recipient of payments is in a common law employment relationship,
and because the considerations underlying the general welfare doctrine are
unique to the determination of federal tax liability, no implication is
intended as to the treatment or effect of such payments or as to whether
an employment relationship exists under any other provision of law,
including the FLSA and other federal and state employment laws."

New compromise with IRS that we must vet with DOL:
"Because this notice is based on the general welfare doctrine, which is
unique to the determination of federal tax liability, no implication is
intended regarding the treatment or effect of TANF payments (or regarding
whether an employment relationship exists) under any other provision of
law, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and other federal and state
employment laws.    This notice does not reach a determination as to
whether the recipient of TANF payments is a common law employee or is
self-employed.   For purposes of the analysis set forth herein, however, it
is assumed that the recipient of the TANF payments is a common law
employee."
