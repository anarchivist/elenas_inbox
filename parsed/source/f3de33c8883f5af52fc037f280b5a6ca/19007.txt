TEXT:
Participants in the education roundtable will be gathering in the
Roosevelt Room Monday Morning from 9:30am to lOam before they go out to
the school.  I've invited Erskine, Podesta, and Rahm to drop-by.  Mickey
Ibarra, Secretary Riley and Secretary Pena will be there.  Bruce,
hopefully you can come by before the briefing.  It would be great to get
Erskine to drop by, so I was hoping you all could encourage him and anyone
else to come -- and make these folks feel like we haven't screwed them!
