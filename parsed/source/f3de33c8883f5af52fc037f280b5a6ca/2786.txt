TEXT:
In yesterday's "Statements" meeting we left out two upcoming statements;
the right to die and religious freedom. I talked to Bill Marshall in
counsel's office and he wanted me to check with DPC if these two subjects
are 1. Something that DPC covers and
2. If DPC could do the first draft of a Presidential statement is reponse
to the Court's opinions.

Could someone let me know? Thanks -Michelle 62531
