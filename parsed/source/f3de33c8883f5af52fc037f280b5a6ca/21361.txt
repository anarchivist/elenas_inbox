TEXT:
Attached is a draft letter to Jim Graham, Commissioner of the North
Carolina Department of Agriculture. The letter concerns declining tobacco
quota and tobacco exports. Tom and Dallas Smith at USDA have looked this
over. Do you want to look this over? Would Erskine want to look it over
given his interest in NC and since Graham has already called him? I will
send you a hard copy of the original letter as well as USDA's draft
response. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

Dear Commissioner Graham:

Thank for your recent letter concerning the future of tobacco farmers in the South and for your
suggestions on policy options the Administration should consider.

I share your concern for the tobacco farmers and their communities. Last September, I included
protections for farmers and their communities as one of my five key principles for tobacco
legislation. I remain committed to working with all parties to make sure we reduce youth
smoking while also protecting farmers, tobacco workers, and the communities in which they live.

I am please that you contacted my chief of staff, Erskine Bowles. Recently, Mr. Bowles and
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman met with members of Congress from tobacco states,
representatives of state governments, growers' representatives, and others to explore possible
alternatives to the projected cut in next year's poundage quota if the current marketing trends
continue throughout the 1998 marketing season. I am forwarding your list of policy options to
Secretary Glickman and his staff so that we can consider them fully.

As you may know, it is my Administration's policy, in light of the serious health consequences of
tobacco use, to not promote the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products. At the same time,
we will continue to insist that all U.S. commodities, including tobacco, are treated fairly in any of
our trade agreements or market access negotiations. The overall objective is to ensure equal
access to a shrinking global market for tobacco.

Thank for sharing your concerns, and I look forward to working with you on ideas to bring more
certainty and stability to the future of tobacco farmers.
