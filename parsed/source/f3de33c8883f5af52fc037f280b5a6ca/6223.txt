TEXT:
At our tobacco farmers meeting last week we discussed inviting Ford's
tobacco guy, Rob Mangus,  in to talk about the state of the tobacco
farmers piece of the legislation and what is happening with buy-outs,
Robb, etc..  I thought we'd invite Dallas Smith and Charlie Rawls as well
but not much more as Rob is likely to be more candid in a small group.
Should we set it up?
