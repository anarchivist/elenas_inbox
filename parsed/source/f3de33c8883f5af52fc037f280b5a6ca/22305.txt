Statement of Gregory Craig
Assistant to the President and Special Counsel
January 14, 1999


The Senate has given us ampie time to present the PresidentO,s defense.
It is a strong defense, and we will be making the PresidentO,s case at the
appointed time next week,

The purpose of my appearance before you tonight is to make a point of
personal privilege on behalf of Mr. Ruff.

When he gave his opening earlier today, Mr. Sensenbrenner falsely
characterized Mr. RuffO,s testimony to use it against the President, and
he misled the Senate. Last month, when Mr. Ruff testified before the
House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sensenbrenner asked him if the President
told the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth when he was
before the grand jury.

Mr. Ruff answered directly, and I quote,   "He surely did."

Mr. Sensenbrenner surely knew that, and I would urge him to correct the
record tomorrow.
