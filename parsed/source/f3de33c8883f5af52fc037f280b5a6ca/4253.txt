Penalties

       The settlement sets ambitious targets for reductions in teen smoking of 30% in 5 years,
50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years. The most recent data show underage prevalence at 18.2%
in 1996, which means approximately 3.5 million youths aged 13-17 are daily smokers.
Because the settlement targets are based on youth prevalence over the past decade, which has
averaged 15.2%, the declines from current levels necessary to comply with the agreement would
have to be 42% over 5 years, 58% over 7, and 67% over 10.

         It is extremely difficult to predict how much teen smoking would decline under the
settlement. Restrictions on youth access and cigarette advertising should have a significant
impact, but no one can say how much. And while teen smokers are particularly sensitive to
price -- the standard elasticity is that a price increase of 10% leads to a reduction in youth
prevalence of7%, compared to 2.6% for adults -- we have never had a price shock of this
magnitude. The Treasury Department estimates that the combined price rise from the current
settlement and the IS-cent excise tax increase in the budget agreement would be about 80 cents
by year 5, which would translate into a 22-28% decrease from current levels from price alone --
but still well short of the settlement targets. The additional reductions brought about by
restrictions on access and advertising are anybody's guess.

        Under the settlement, companies would have to pay $80 million for each percentage point
they fall short, which is supposed to recapture the industry's projected profits from hooking that
many young smokers. (The Treasury Department says a more accurate projection of profits
would be $60 million a point, which is roughly equal to $80 million after taxes.) Public health
groups have praised the idea of targets and penalties, but complain that the current scheme does
not give companies sufficient incentive to stop hooking teenagers. The major criticisms against
the current penalties are that they are tax-deductible, abatable, capped at $2 billion in a given
year, and too small to serve as a deterrent.

       The companies might accept penalties of $80 million a point that were not tax-deductible
and could not be abated. They say they are unwilling to increase the price per point and
eliminate the $2 billion annual cap.

         We recommend a two-tier system, with graduated penalties that get stiffer ifthe industry
misses the targets by a substantial margin. For example, the first tier of penalties could require
companies to pay $80 million per point if the industry missed the targets by less than 5 points in
year 5, less than 10 points in year 7, and less than 15 points in year 10. This penalty would be
non-deductible, could not be abated, and would reflect a company's share of the youth market.
If the industry missed by a greater margin, companies would pay the full first-tier penalty, and a
non-deductible second-tier penalty that represented a larger multiple of profits and rose over time
-- e.g., $ _ million a point in year 5, $ _ million a point in year 7, $ _ million a point in year
10. Companies could be required to lock in this second-tier penalty as a permanent price
increase that would help further reduce smoking by youth (and adults). Under this approach, the
penalties could reach as high as _ cents a pack by year 10 if youth smoking failed to decline.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

Farmers

       We have made clear that tobacco farmers should receive protection in any legislative
settlement, and that the Administration will work closely with members of Congress from
tobacco states to forge a consensus_ Secretary Glickman has traveled to tobacco markets in
Virginia and North Carolina to express this commitment directly to farmers.

        Farmers are primarily interested in continuation of the governmental tobacco program,
guaranteed purchase at set levels oftobacco crops by cigarette companies, and some provision
for buyout and transition to other crops, on a voluntary basis. Because farm groups and tobacco
state members have not yet coalesced around a consensus proposal, we may not need to commit
to a specific plan yet. The most discussed proposal is one released this month by Senators Ford
and McConnell that would require companies to buy a minimum amount of domestic tobacco
over 25 years and would install penalties on companies that do not meet the stated goals for
tobacco buying. The proposal would also create a "Tobacco Community Revitalization Fund"
administered by USDA, but not subject to the appropriation process, which could spend up to $1
billion a year for 25 years from the settlement fund and would cover costs related to the tobacco
program such as administration and crop insurance, make supplemental payments of up to $500
million to producers whose income from tobacco drops substantially below the 1996 level, pay
up to $100 million in benefits for displaced cigarette factory workers, and provide up to $250
million a year for rural economic development grants.

       Because of GATT, Congress cannot require companies to purchase a set level of
domestic tobacco. However, a private contract between growers and the industry would
probably not trigger a GATT violation.


Funding

         Although the settlement is advertised at $368.5 billion, a variety of factors conspire to
leave us with considerably less than that to spend on any new initiatives. The $368 billion is a
25-year number, and must be adjusted downward to reflect a projected drop in cigarette
consumption of about 15%. For scoring purposes, OMB adjusts the amount down still further to
reflect lost business tax revenue and lost federal excise tax revenue from decreased consumption.
 Most of the rest of the money in the settlement is already spoken for, to pay for civil suits,
cessation programs, counteradvertising, and the states' Medicaid claims.

        At current funding levels, the main decision to be made is how best to spend the $25
billion research trust fund, which could serve as a 21 st Century Research Fund dedicated to
cancer and other tobacco-related research.

       Additional funds could be raised by:

        1) Eliminating the $50 billion tax credit in the budget agreement. This would increase
the 25-year number from $368 billion to $430 billion, and free up about $2 billion a year for new


                                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
            initiatives. That money could be used to double tobacco-related illness research ($1.3 billion per
            year) and make targeted investments in tobacco-related public health initiatives such as
            school-based clincis, Healthy Start programs, cancer prevention, and substance abuse treatment.

                     2) Strengthening the penalties for failing to reduce teen smoking. The current penalties
            generate about $25 <ck> billion over 25 years, all of which goes to the states to expand
            anti-smoking efforts. A graduated penalty scheme could increase the 25-year number to $ _
            billion, which could be evenly divided between the states and the federal government. This
            would generate $_ billion a year beginning in year 5, which could be dedicated to additional
            research and/or coverage expansions, such as allowing people between ages 55 and 65 to buy
            into Medicare ($2-4 billion per year); covering workers between jobs ($2-3 billion per year) and
            Medicaid outreach ($500 million to $1 billion per year).

                    3) Increasing the industry's upfront one-time payment, from $10 billion to $30 billion,
            and indexing the inflation adjuster to GDP rather than CPI (since GDP is more in line with
            medical cost growth). This would increase the 25-year number to $ _ billion, and generate $_
            billion a year, which could be used for any of the initiatives outlined above, other investments
            such as child care ($500 million to $1 billion per year) or medical education for doctors training
            in children's hospitals ($300 million per year), or deficit reduction (offsetting lost federal excise
            tax revenue from declining cigarette sales).

                    The industry will vehemently resist any effort to move beyond current funding levels.
            The most outspoken tobacco opponents, such as Senator Kennedy and Skip Humphrey, have
            called for a 25-year number in the range of $600-800 billion. Rep. Waxman and David Kessler
            would like to see a $1.50 a pack increase, which would require either $900 billion over 25 years
            or the current base payments with enhanced penalties that could reach 90 cents a pack.
