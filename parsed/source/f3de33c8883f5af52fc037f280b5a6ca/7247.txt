, TEXT:
  It's looking pretty likely that the stars (and calendars) are aligning for
  May 7th around 2 p.m. to have Secretaries Slater and Herman, and Dep Sec
  Thurm do an event here to release joint guidance on transportation, and
  build support for Access to Jobs funding.  We'll be identifying a few key
  states (maybe Govs) to invite, as well as key Congressional supporters.
