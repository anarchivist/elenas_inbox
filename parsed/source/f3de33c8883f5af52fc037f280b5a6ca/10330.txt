Policy Rational and Cost: The initiative has four parts, taking steps in each of the areas the
President identified at the Native American Economic Development Conference.

1.     1000 New Teachers for Native American Students. American Indian children have
       the highest drop-out rate and the lowest high school completion rate of any,racial or
       ethnic group in the country. Despite this tremendous need, American Indian school
       children have few role models to guide them. Of the Nation's more than 2 million
       elementary and secondary teachers, less than 1 percent -- only 18,000 teachers, are
       American Indian/Alaska Native. Recognizing these needs and challenges, the plan
       seeks to train 1000 new Native American teachers. At the Native American Economic
       Development Conference, the President signed an executive order that called for an
       interagency plan to be developed with recommendations identifying initiatives,
       strategies, and ideas for future action to support the goal of improved education.
       Our plan seeks to increase the number of American Indians entering the teaching field
       and to enhance the skills ofthose already in the pipeline. The Department of Education
       proposal has three parts: (1) a fellowship program that will support the training of 1000
       new American Indian and Alaska Native teachers over 5 years by providing for their
       expenses while attending school, including child care; (2) funding for 25 grants to
       educational institutions, with priorities for partnerships with tribal colleges, to create
       teacher training programs in Native American communities; and (3) providing continuing
       education for in-service teachers to improve the quality of teaching in Native American
       communities. (Cost.: $10 million.)

       Uncertainties and vetting: This initiative was not included in the Department of
       Education's initial budget request, but had requested $3 million for a related effort on
       professional development. In its appeals, the Department has included a request for our
       $10 million initiative. (The Department would require approximately $7 million in
       additional money above their initial request initiative coupled with another $3 million
       from their initial budget request that theyhave reallocated to this initiative.) Education
       and DPC have been working with OMB very closely and OMB has become more
       supportive of the idea. Both Interior and Education are very much in favor of this idea.


2.     Technical Assistance for Economic Development. At the Native American Economic
       Development Conference, the President directed the Department of the Interior, the
       Department of Commerce, and the Small Business Administration to develop, within 90
       days, a strategic plan for coordinating economic development initiatives for Native
       American and Alaska Native communities. The centerpiece of the strategic plan would
       provide a toll-free number, located at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in which tribes could
       access information about how the federal government can assist them in economic
       development efforts. This number would provide one point-of-contact for tribes across


                                                1        Automated Records Management System

     intricacies of specific government programs. In addition, the BIA will organize business
     seminars throughout Indian country (staffed by various agency representatives) which
     will consist of both general sessions and individualized technical assistance. (Cost:
     $1,043,640).

     Uncertainties and vetting: Interior did not include this in their initial budget request or
     their appeal stating that they had to make hard choices and that they hoped the WH would
     push the plan. OMB is generally supportive of this request, but doesn't know where
     additional money would come from. Interior, the groups (National Congress of
     American Indians), and the tribes are very enthusiastic about this initiative.

3.   BIA School Construction and Repair. Compared to other schools, Bureau of Indian
     Affairs schools are generally in worse condition. Two-thirds of the educational facilities
     are over 30 years old and more than one-quarter over 50 years old. The backlog to
     correct safety and code deficiencies and to replace existing facilities exceeds $1 billion
     and is growing. With new funds, BIA will build three new schools and provide much
     needed repairs to several others. This proposal follows the President's initiative from
     last year that sought a 61 percent increase over FY 1998 ($87 million was in the
     President's budget, Congress gave $60 million) and is also included as a response to the
     President's Native American education executive order. (Cost: For FY 2000, BIA
     requested $108.8 million but received only $78.3 million from OMB, they request the
     difference --$30.5 million.)

     Uncertainties and vetting: Interior strongly supports this measure. The groups have
     listed this as one oftheir priority areas. OMB is generally supportive, but doesn't know
     where the additional money would come from.


4.   Improving Health Care. There is a high degree of well-documented unmet health care
     needs in the Native American community. Because of inflation and the fact that the
     Native American population is one of the fasting growing, a major emphasis of the illS
     FY2000 budget is on increased funding'to restore access to basic health care services such
     as immunizations, emergency care, primary care visits, well-child visits, and needed
     improvements in basic facilities. This proposal also includes program enhancements in
     health care for women, children, and the elderly. (Cost: $207 million. illS requested
     $382 million above FY 1999 enacted, the passback provided $175 million).

     Uncertainties and vetting: OMB is supportive of increasing funding for health care,
     but feels that the entire amount should not be given in one year because illS doesn't have
     the capacity. OMB fully funded the access to clinical care part ofthe request and feels
     that is the most important area. illS feels it can absorb these funds and has appealed for
     the full amount of its request.
