Subject:         White House statement on meehan/hansen bill

As you probably know, Meehan and Hansen are planning to introduce their
menu bill tomorrow, tuesday march 9. They would like to know if we are
interested in putting out a statement supporting their effort.  It is
likely they will drop the bill in the mid afternoon.

Waxman is still working on his bill which would bring a large percentage
of the money back under the control of the federal government (largely to
finance a national anti smoking ad campaign), give a portion to the states
with conditions, and put the rest into debt reduction or other uses.
Waxman is not supportive of the Meehan effort.

Meehan's staff believes they will be able to get all of the cosponsors
they had last year (almost 100, 16 republicans) with more republicans
because the tax and lookback provisions are not in the bill. Meehan is
planning to introduce the FDA legislative authority bill separately this
week. Hansen is reportedly working with the leadership in the House to
build a broader base of support.
