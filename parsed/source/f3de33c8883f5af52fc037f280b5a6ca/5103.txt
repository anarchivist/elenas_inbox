TEXT:
Elena: As you can see, this bill is turning into a serious Christmas
tree.  It needs to wrap up soon or it will sink of its own weight. (Mixed
metaphors, but I think you get the picture.)

Immigration -- Central Americans/Haitians:  This week, House and Senate
Republicans continued to negotiate over the legislative package intended
to remedy certain problems the 1996 immigration law created for Central
Americans. Two key issues remain uncertain.   First, the Senate-- Chairman
Abraham in particular-- opposes the House proposal to eliminate the
unskilled worker category (10,000 visas annually) as a tradeoff for
giving certain Central Americans permanent legal status. The Senate is
considering a counter proposal to reduce the annual numbers of unskilled
worker visas and diversity visas by 5,000 each. ( The diversity category
is 50,000 visas annually, which are designated for individuals from
underrepresented countries. This category is primarily used by nationals
from Africa and Europe.)

Second, different caucuses are now seeking expand the final legislation to
afford relief to immigrants who otherwise would not have been covered by
existing proposals. The CBC is pushing to get amnesty for Haitians who
were paroled into the U.S. by the Bush Administration following the coup
d'etat against President Aristide in 1991. Our preference would be to
afford relief to the Haitians similar to what our legislative proposal
would give to the majority of Central Americans.  In addition, Senator
Abraham has proposed including relief for asylum-seekers from Eastern
European countries who fled communist governments before the end of 1990.
