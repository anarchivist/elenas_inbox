    Brad--My friend at INS is Joel Ginsburg, special asst to the
commish.
    He's at:
               Joel.Ginsberg@justice.usdoj.gov

        Please send him the INS stuff, and let him know you've been sending
        stuff to Diegeman. I think he'll take care of it.   Thanks.

        Bob

         Most of the comments that come to our web site are about the
         site or about NPR, but we get a fair number of comments about
         government in general, or agencies in particular.

         The complaint about INS below is typical of the comments to the NPR
web
         site about this agency. This is a highly visible HIA and it needs
help.
        Brad Leonard, who responds to most program-related comments on our
site,
        could give many more examples of poor service by INS.

          Brad always forwards web comments about agencies to appropriate
agency
