Bruce received a proposal from Stanford requesting that the President
write an article on education for the tenth anniversary of the Stanford
Review, which he forwarded to ""Ann. We have written a draft memo to the
President and would like to know if we can include a line saying that
"Bruce Reed agrees with the proposal." Please let me know soon so that I
can get the memo to staff sec'ry. Thanks.
