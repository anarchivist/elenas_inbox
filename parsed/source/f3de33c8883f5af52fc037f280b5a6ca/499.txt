TEXT:
HHS has almost resolved the New York state tanf plan
certification. New York (Bryan Wing) sent HHS an outraged, angry
letter, but it included a sentence on the state's intention to
comply with the time limits that essentially satisfies HHS's
concerns and allows them to offer NY the same deal we offered
California. As a result, HHS is anxious to wrap this up and
certify the state's plan as complete. This will happen as soon as
later today or tomorrow.  I will assume you don't have a problem
with this unless you let me know.
