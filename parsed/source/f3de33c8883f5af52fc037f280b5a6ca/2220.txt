TEXT:
Yes, the hearing was last Thursday and went fine.   I referred to it
briefly in this mornings DPC meeting.   Shays focus was mainly on the
Dessert Storm / DOD issues and only briefly looked at the informed consent
questions.   Satcher and Varmus presented their positions followed by Peter
Lurie's testimony, but there was not time (or interest) in follow up
questions.

I am just starting this memo, would tomorrow AM be soon enough? If not I
can get you something this afternoon, I wanted to run it by HHS for
accuracy, but if this is not crucial I can have it to you today.

Eric
