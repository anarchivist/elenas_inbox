 TEXT:
 Jennifer Palmeri asked where in tobacco country the President should go,
 if he goes some where on April 9.  I told her I thought the best place to
 go would be North Carolina.

 Reasons:
   (1) It is the regional center for flue cured tobacco for several states
 and would get a lot of media attention (NC/SC/GA/VA);

 (2) Glickman went to NC and was well received by farmers,. KY may be more
 unpredictable;

 (3) Governor Hunt and ago commish Graham are very good for the President
 and are good with the farmers, KY again is more difficult poltically;

  (4) Dallas Smith says that NC would be the best place. He suggests he
 fly into Raliegh Durham and there are some farms within about 10 minutes
 or into an AFB near Goldsboro which is in the heart of tobacco country;

  (5) Erskine is from NC which would be good;

 (6) VA. is close,but Richmond is closely identified as the home of the
 companies, and the growers are in the south part of the state which means
 you'd have to get down near Durham anyway.  I ' l l look around for the
 closest tobacco farm to DC to see the closest place we could get a
 backdrop.
