        TO address a few concerns:

        This version is NOT more comprehensive than Local Flex bill last
year.

         That bill was govt-wide, and included regulatory agencies -- was a
        lot of opposition from regulatory side, particularly
        environmentalists.

        This version also includes only programs under jurisidiction of
        Labor-HHS-Ed Appropriations subcommittee - not justice, agriculture,
        et al.

        Strong opposition last year came from, in addition to
        environmentalists, the education voucher issue (which needs to be
        addressed through exclusion) and from labor unions. Re: labor unions,
        the Admin's exclusions list for Local Flex addressed this ... a more
        specific list is part of the Workforce Flexibility provisions passed
        in approp. act last year. These were worked out with labor unions and
        include the following exclusions:

        For Title I-III of JTPA (EXCEPTIONS for requirements relating to wage
        and labor standards, grievance procdures and judicial review,
        non-discrimination, allotment of funds (would not want this if want
        funding flexibility), and eligibility (don't recommend this; really
        restricts flexibilityO)

     For Wagner-Peyser Act (EXEMPTIONS FOR: requirements relating to the
     provision of services to unemployment insurance claimants and
     venterans, and to univesal access to basic labor exchange services
     without cost to job sekkers)==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ===============
