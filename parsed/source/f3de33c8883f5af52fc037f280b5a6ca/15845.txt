TEXT:
The next meeting will be from 2:30 to 3:30 on Friday, in room 231.
Everyone will be cleared in. Topics are: (i) negligent entrustment; (ii)
small business exceptions; (iii) misuse and alteration; (iv) workers
compo We'll move quickly.

What follows are the options currently extant.   Please be careful.

Joint and several
Proposal 1 - Reallocation
        DD      Joint and several if the plaintiff is fault-free
        DD      If the plaintiff is at all at fault, liability is
several, but if the plaintiff cannot collect from one or more defendant
after a specified period of time        the plaintiff can petition the court for
reallocation of damages not attributable to the plaintiff among the
remaining defendants, but no defendant less at fault than the plaintiff.
may be charged with more than twice his proportionate share of damages
        DD      This would be two-way preemptive
Proposal 2A - Guaranteed recovery, two-way preemption
        DD      Joint and several liability of any defendant is than 30%
at fault (taking into account the fault of the plaintiff and settling
defendants)
        DD      If any defendant is less than 30% at fault, that
defendantD,s responsibility would be limited to a maximum of twice the
defendantD,s proportionate share of non-economic damages except where a
greater multiplier was needed to ensure the plaintiff recovery of at least
50% of the assessed non-economic damages.
Proposal 2B - Guaranteed recovery, one-way preemption
        DD      Joint and several liability of any defendant is than 10%
at fault (taking into account the fault of the plaintiff and settling
defendants)
        DD      If any defendant is less than 10% at fault, that
defendantD,s responsibility would be limited to a maximum of twice the
defendantD,s proportionate share of non-economic damages except where a
 .,
greater multiplier was needed to ensure the plaintiff recovery of at least
60% of the assessed non-economic damages.

 Punitive damages
 Proposal 1 - Procedural changes only
         00       Support the provisions in S.648 providing for uniform
federal standards of clear and convincing evidence and the right to
request bifurcation.
         00       Support a uniform federal liability standard for
punitive damages that would not include recklessness, but (i) would not
require that the conduct that is the subject of the punitive damages is
the O&proximate cause08 of the plaintiff D,s harm and (ii) would explicitly
permit circumstantial evidence of intent or malice.
         00       This would be two-way preemption, except that it would
not require states that currently do not allow punitive damages in
products cases to allow such awards       .
Proposal 2 - Personal cap plus allocation of remaining punitive damages to
state
         00      Authorize the jury to impose punitive damages without
any cap
         00      Vest the plaintiff in a 25% share of the total punitive
damages, which amount will be assumed to include attorneyO,s fees (i.e.,
no additional attorneyO,s fees will be payable out of the punitive award)
         00      The remainder of the award would be payable to the state
whose substantive law applies to the determination of punitive damages.
         00       States would be forbidden to intervene in the
prodeedings at any stage.
         00      Combine this with the procedural reforms outlined in
Proposal 1
         00      This would be two-way preemptive except (i) it would not
require states that do not allow punitive damages in products cases to
allow such awards and (ii) states would explicitly be allowed to opt out
of the allocation to the state, in which case prior state law with respect
to caps and allocation would apply
Proposal 3 - Advisory jury opinion with judicial determination
         00      The jury would render a solely advisory opinion on
punitive damages
         00      The actual deterimination of punitive damages would be
made by the judge
         00      The judge would be required to consider the factors in
S.648, and would be required to explain why the judgeD,s award differs
 (either higher or lower) from the juryO,s advice
         00      Combine with procedural changes from proposal 1
Proposal 4 - Cap with easier breakthrough
         00      Cap punitive damages at the greater of $250,000 or twice
compensatories (the lesser of the two for small businesses)
         do      Do not tell the jury of the cap
         00      Allow the judge to award punitive damages above the cap
without an additional proceeding and on a simple finding that the capped
amount is O&insufficient to punish or deter,08 the standard in S.648, with
no consideration of specified factors
         00      Insist that there be no legislative history suggesting
this authority is to be used any more sparingly than implied by the
statutory standard
         00      Couple this with the procedural changes described in
proposal 1
         00      This would be two-way preemptive, except with respect to
states that do not allow punitives in products cases at all

Statute of repose
 l.


        00       Two-way preemption of state law (as in S.648)
        00       18 year statute of repose (as in S.648)
        00       Which a plaintiff may overcome by clear and convincing
evidence that the product had a longer useful safe life (not included in
S.648, and responsive to the victim of the hay-baler accident cited in the
veto message and to accidents involving products clearly intended to be
longer-lived, such as elevators)
        00       Covering only durable goods in the workplace (narrower
than S.648, retaining plaintiff rights concerning consumer goods in states
without any statute of repose and responding to your concern about
handguns)
        00       With further exceptions for toxic substances, vehicles
used in transportation for hire, and express warranties (as in S.648)
        00       And with a provision that extends the statute to allow
full benefit of the two-year statute of limitations after injury or
discovery of harm in, for example, year 17 (not in S.648, but not expected
to be a problem)
