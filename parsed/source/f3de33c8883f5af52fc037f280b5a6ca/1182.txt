TEXT:
everyone just listened to ken talk (about why we should do it, but why it
may take some steam out of the fix package) so I guess we can take that as
agreement.

(On my brain question, I do know about the timing of the Reiner TV
special. What the CEO of the summit asked me is if we are planning a WH
event on the brain on the night of the Reiner special.  I assume based on
your answer that we aren't.)
