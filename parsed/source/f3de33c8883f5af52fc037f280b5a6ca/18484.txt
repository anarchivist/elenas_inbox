                          WELFARE TO WORK HOUSING VOUCHERS

       The President's FY99 budget will take further steps to promote work and welfare reform
through a new plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need
housing assistance in order to get or keep a job.

       Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long
commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting
to work every day on time. These targeted vouchers will give people on welfare a new tool to
make the transition to a job and succeed in the work place.

         The $283 million proposal will help address the problem that in many regions, jobs are
being created far from where many welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new
jobs are being created in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or
central cities. To make this daily commute possible, the President is fighting for a $600 million
welfare-to-work transportation initiative as part of the reauthorization of ISTEA. But in some
cases it makes more sense for someone to move closer to work -- and this new proposal will make
that move from welfare to work possible.

How It Will Work

        These vouchers will provide States and communities with a new flexible tool to help
families who need housing assistance in order to achieve self-sufficiency.

·      The additional vouchers will be available on a competitive basis to local housing agencies.
       Local housing agencies, including Indian housing authorities, may submit an application,
       developed in consultation with the state, local, or tribal welfare agency and the local
       Welfare-to-Work formula funds grantee (typically the Private Industry Council).

·      The vouchers will be used where they are essential to a successful transition from welfare to
       work--that is, where housing assistance is critical for a family to get or keep a job.

·      Families who receive the vouchers must be eligible for or currently receiving Temporary
       Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or have received TANF within the past year.

         The initiative recognizes the direct link between affordable housing and self-sufficiency.
Along with the Administration's proposal to increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, this
initiative will make decent, affordable housing available to more Americans.

       The most recent data (1993) show that approximately 2.7 million African American
households and 1.8 million Hispanic American households were eligible for but did not receive
housing assistance. These new vouchers will help address the unmet housing need for some
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
