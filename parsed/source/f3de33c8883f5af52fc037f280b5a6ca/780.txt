Caseworker Discretion in Welfare Refonn -- You asked about a recent New York Times Op Ed
asserting that welfare refonn's work requirements will be undercut because of the liberal
attitudes of welfare caseworkers. You asked "how much caseworker discretion is left?"

As you know, the welfare law allows only 20% of the case load to be exempt from the five-year
time limit, has a strict definition of work, and sets work participation requirements for the states.
As the article notes, however, state waivers with features that vary from the Federal standards are
grandfathered for the life of the waiver, and some of them last for 10 years. Although the law
does not allow us to override waivers, we have made it clear to the states that they should not use
waivers to evade the work requirements of the bill, and that we will seek legislation to amend the
law if we learn that states are doing so. This is an area we must continue to watch closely, since
HHS would be inclined to give states more leeway in this area than we would.

[Elena: Not sure Bruce would concede the following sentence is true, i.e., that we would
allow states to operate weaker versions of the time limits or work requirements.] Even
given all of the above, caseworkers will have far less discretion than they have in the past, since
every state will now have some type oftime limit and work requirement, whether under Federal
rules or state waivers.

State Devolution to Local Government in Welfare Refonn -- In response to a Washington Post
report that many states will give counties or other local governments responsibility for
implementing welfare refonn, you asked how much devolution the law allows.

The law allows states tremendous latitude to devolve responsibility. Although states are
ultimately responsible for ensuring that the Federal law's requirements are carried out, they can
require or penn it local governments to design benefit systems, and even to share in or bear the
total burden of any Federal penalties if they fail. As the article notes, local variations in benefit
packages could be a positive development, as counties use their funds to meet needs unique to
their area.

A greater concern is whether states will distribute funds equitably across regions. Since AFDC
required standard state-wide per capita grants, the states did not have to deal with this question in
the past. Presumably this question will be subject to the usual political debates in state capitals.
It is an important issue in all states, but states that give counties responsibility for outcomes have
a special responsibility to ensure that the money goes where the need is. In addition, certain
regions will argue that distributing aid on a per capita basis is unfair to them because their needs
are greater and it is more expensive to return their welfare population to work than in other
regions.

Of course, state fonnulas will be subject to court challenges, but the outcomes will undoubtedly
vary by state.
