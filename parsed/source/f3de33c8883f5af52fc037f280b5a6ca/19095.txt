TEXT:
They called DOJ, who told them not possibly before Wednesday, not
tentatively for Wednesday at 10:00. I think we can't not do this
meeting ... we'll just need to decide what we can say by then.  Also,
Conrad's and John Kerry's office have similar questions .... once we meet
with Daschle, we will probably need to do those meetings (what do you
think about combining them?)
