     PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS CONTINUES TO RISE


         Many Noted National Organizations Recognize Efficacy

  WASHINGTON -- Needle exchange programs continue to gain support among
  responsible Americans as mounting scientific evidence shows they are an
  effective way to curb the spread of HIV and AIDS, according to the Human
  Rights Campaign.

          "From the American Medical Association to the American Bar
  Association, respected professional'and public health organizations are
  lining up behind these programs because they save lives without increasing
  drug use," said Kim Mills, an HRC spokeswoman.

          Needle exchange programs provide intravenous drug users with
  sterile syringes in exchange for used ones. Such programs have been
  implemented in more than 100 communities around the country, and have been
  shown to stem the spread of HIV and other blood-borne diseases transmitted
  through the sharing of injection equipment.

          Approximately one-third of reported AIDS cases are related to
  intravenous drug use.   In February, a report by the Department of Health
  and Human Services found that needle exchange programs are effective in
  slowing the spread of HIV and AIDS. six federally funded studies have
  reported that needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and do not
  increase drug use.

          Also in February, a panel of public health experts at the National
  Institutes of Health concluded that needle exchange programs are a powerful
  and proven weapon in the war against HIV and AIDS.

          Plus, a majority of the American public -- 55 percent -- favors
  needle exchange programs as a method to curb the spread of HIV and AIDS,
  according to a bipartisan poll conducted for the Human Rights Campaign.

           The poll found 55 percent "strongly favor" or "somewhat favor"
  needle exchange programs while 38 percent "somewhat oppose" or "strongly
  oppose" them. The poll was conducted for HRC by the Tarrance Group, a
  Republican firm, and Lake Sosin Snell and Associates, Democratic pollsters.
  The results are based on a survey of 1,000 registered voters contacted
  between April 8-10.

          The poll found that 64 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of
  independents and 45 percent of Republicans favor needle exchange programs.
  In addition, needle exchange finds support in ever region of the country,
  with 64 percent of Americans favoring it in the West, 60 percent in the
  Northeast, 51 percent in the South and 49 percent in the Midwest. The
  poll's margin of error is +/- 3.1 percent.

          Earlier this month, the American Bar Association endorsed the use
  of needle exchange programs, joining such groups as the American Public
  Health Association, the Association of State and Territorial Health
  Officials, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Black Caucus of
  State Legislators and the u.S. Conference of Mayors.

       "Science should drive the debate over needle exchange programs and
  their efficacy," Mills
  said. "But we hope members of Congress and the administration will heed
  this message from their constituents and work together to allow federal
  funds to be used for these life-saving programs."

         By law, federal funds may not be used for needle exchange programs


 unless the Department of Health and Human Services gives the green light,
 which it has not done.

         The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
 political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
 lobbies Congress, provides campaign support and educates the public to
 ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest and saf·e at home,
 at work and in the community.
