Subject: Deputies Meeting

At the Deputies Meeting Maria committed to working with Sens. Dodd and
Graham on the issue of the Central America trip interfering with the vote
on edflex.

The issue of whether to do over the counter drugs or the crime/guns EO
that was not used last week for next weeks radio address was discussed.
The group expressed interest in the VPOTUS doing the crime/guns EO (Lyn
Cutler).  I said I would check with you on our view.

Maria also asked about elder crimes, whether we could dig up the stuff
from last September.  I told her Chris might have some reservations for a
variety of political reasons (upsetting certain health care groups) and my
understanding from Jose is that the window for doing the September
announcement probably has past.
