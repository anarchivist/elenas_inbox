TEXT:
Elena,
I spoke with Bob Bach from INS last week.   He said that the draft
legislation was not finished and that they had some questions about our
strategy for moving forward.  According to Bob, INS still wants to include
pay equity for inspectors (equivalent to law enforcement officers) in the
legislation. The last time we discussed this, OMB made clear that this
was not do-able at this time (it would be very expensive and was not
anticipated in FY99). According to Peter, we must get draft legislation
introduced -- a vehicle to nail down Reyes and others and to keep the
discussion moving with our proposal as a frame.

Last week, Abraham made a speech in which he stated his intention to hold
oversight hearings (starting after the Memorial day recess) to determine
the best way to reform the agency and that he would consider the
Administration's proposal and other alternatives.  He also stated that he
does not think that the issue of INS reform will be resolved this
Congress. This is a good sign, b/c it signals to the appropriators
(Rogers) that Abraham sees this as his (not their) issue.   However, INS
has indicated that they may want to move forward with reform without
blessing from the Congress.  Peter's instinct, given Abraham's statement,
is for INS not to move forward without Congress's o.k.  He would, however,
want to know if INS has any different intelligence on this.   Peter has
calls into their leg. person (Alan Erenbaum) .

I have a call into Bob to make clear our strategy and to ask that we set
something up with us and OMB later in the week to resolve any.lingering
issues that they may have with the legislation and our overall legislative
strategy.

Julie
