                 Questions and Answers on Tobacco Taxes and Budget
                                  January 19, 1998

Q.   Are you concerned by comments by some members of Congress that tobacco
     legislation may be getting stalled -- that you may not be serious about getting a bill --
      and suggesting that you should take a more active role in pushing legislation?

A.   I am committed to enacting comprehensive bipartisan tobacco legislation. So any
     comments to the contrary are just wrong. We are making very solid progress towards
     enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation that will reduce teen smoking. I've
     proposed a very clear set of principles about what should be in the bill -- the first issue
     being that this is about protecting kids, not money or political advantage. I've met
     personally with senior members involved in this issue -- I've assured them that we want
     to get this done, that we will. Our staff has met with members of both parties. My
     budget will contain some details on how we should get this done, but we will work with
     Congress in a bipartisan way. Already there have been several bills introduced and I
     expect a few more will in the next couple of months and that is the natural way in
     Congress. This has been a long battle we have been fighting and we will stay with it,
     and it will make a difference to the health of millions of children over the next few years.
      We have to get it done.

Q.   Do recent events, the tobacco settlement in Texas or the release of documents
     showing some companies were marketing to children, diminish the need for
     legislation or the chance that it would get passed?

A.   No. It is a good sign that industry is being held accountable for the harms it has caused,
     and that we are getting information out about how the industry has hurt children. But
     that should serve as an impetus for comprehensive legislation. We need a
     comprehensive system of penalties to make sure companies reduce teen smoking, we
     need the FDA to have authority over tobacco products to protect our health, to make sure
     advertiSing doesn't go after our kids. So we need legislation, and it should be
     bi-partisan. I think all the attention from these events makes it clear why we need a
     national solution, and that we should try and get it done soon.

Q.   Your proposed budget call for a tax on tobacco products, how much money do you
     believe can be raised in this manner?

A.   I have urged Congress to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce teen smoking,
     and my proposed budget assumes some revenues from the passage of such legislation.
     It's very important to understand that these revenues need not come from a tax; they
     could result from industry payments and penalties pursuant to a settlement agreement.
     The revenues assumed in the budget will be consistent with my prior demand for a
     combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up
     to $1.50 over the next decade, as necessary to meet youth smoking reduction targets.
                                                                                      \
                                                                         Automated Records Management Systerr
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

    Q.   Are the revenue estimates reported in The Wall Street Journal accurate -- i.e., that
         your budget assumes that tobacco payments will raise $10 billion in FY 99 and $40
         to $60 billion over five years?

    A.   I won't comment on particular budget numbers until we actually release the budget. The
         projected revenues we use in the budget will be consistent with what I have called for in
         the past: a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of
         cigarettes by up to $1.50 over the next decade, as necessary to meet youth smoking
         reduction targets.


    Q.   There are various reports about how much money from tobacco legislation will go to
         the states, and whether the federal government has any right to this money. What
         do you think the states are entitled to?

    A.   My first goal is to pass national tobacco legislation to reduce teen smoking. The specific
         allocation of monies is a secondary issue, which I will work to resolve with the states and
         Congress. Both the states and the Administration have worked hard to create the
         conditions for national legislation -- by bringing suit against the tobacco companies and
         by asserting regulatory power over them. I am confident we will be able to reach -- and
         to incorporate in legislation -- a mutually agreeable approach to the allocation issue that
         fully recognizes the states' contribution.
