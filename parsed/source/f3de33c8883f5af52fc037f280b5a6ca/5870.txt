TEXT:
Sylvia has been asking about the guidance and whether there is a proposed
roll-out plan.  Is it possible to get our (Bill's and my) memorandum
describing the status of the document and proposing a roll-out to her soon?

Bill:  I am reviewing the most recent DoJ and ED drafts tOday.  Can we
talk at the end of the day about next steps?  (We should probably meet
again with the agencies to go over this draft before we start vetting.)
