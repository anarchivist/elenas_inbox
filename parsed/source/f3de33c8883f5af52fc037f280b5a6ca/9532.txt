TEXT:
It was decided that Gene would call Abraham this afternoon to try to get
him to agree (in a low temperature way) to remove the "$60K or masters (or
equivalent)" exemption from the attestations.   If unsuccessful, he will
try to push for $80K and for defining "equivalent" to mean a foreign
degree equivalent to a U.S. masters.  If Abraham says no, we will go ahead
with the bill, with the intent to clarify what "or equivalent" means in
regulations. If Abraham makes a floor statement re: what he means by
equivalent, we will ask a member to make a statement re: what we mean.
