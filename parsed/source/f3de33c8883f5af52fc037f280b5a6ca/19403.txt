                         FOR PASSAGE OF COMPREHENSIVE
                              TOBACCO LEGISLATION

                                          April 9, 1998

Today, the President traveled to Carrollton, Kentucky to meet with tobacco farmers and to
address students at Carroll County High School. The President's trip highlights his
commitment to protecting farmers and reducing youth smoking, which were two of the five
key elements of the bipartisan comprehensive tobacco legislation the President has called
on Congress to pass this year.

Roundtable with Tobacco Farmers and Members of the Farming Community

The President held a roundtable discussion in the Kentuckiana Tobacco Warehouse with
tobacco farmers and members of the community, including a student and tobacco
warehouse owner. The panel also included Rod Kuegel, the President of the Burley
Tobacco Growers Cooperative -- an organization that represents 150,000 tobacco farm
families in five states -- and Bill Sprague, the President of the Kentucky Farm Bureau -- the
largest farming organization in the state. This roundtable provided an opportunity for the
President to listen to the concerns of farmers and the community regarding comprehensive
tobacco legislation.

The President said that legislation proposed by Senator Ford, which is included in Senator
McCain's comprehensive tobacco bill, satisfies his principle of protecting farmers and their
communities. The legislation continues a production control system for tobacco, gives
farmers the option of buying out of the program, and provides for economic development
grants for rural communities.

Addressing Students at Carroll County High School

The President also addressed approximately 2200 students and adults at the Carroll
County High School where he emphasized his commitment to reducing youth smoking.
The President was joined by Senator Ford, Governor Patton, and Agriculture Secretary
Glickman. The President urged Congress to act ~ to pass comprehensive tobacco
legislation. There are as few as 70 working days left before this Congress adjourns. On every
one of those days, 3,000 children will become regular smokers, and 1,000 adults will die from
smoking. To prevent this hann, Congress must pass comprehensive, bipartisan legislation
which raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, expressly
confinns the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, gets tobacco companies out of the
business of marketing to children, furthers public health research and goals, and protects tobacco
fanners and their communities.
