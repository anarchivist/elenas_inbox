        first, thank you for joining the meeting this morning, especially
on such short notice.  second, sandy feldman wants to meet with our social
security team for a briefing. sweeney thought this would be very good
since sandy is very inclined to be helpful. gene, pIs feel free to have
whoever you want in the meeting ---larry stein would be helpful -- and
perhaps bruce may want to join us for at least part of the meeting since
he does so much work wi sandy

melissa would you set this up probably directly with sandy feldman's
office -- gigi georges could give you some guidance.

thanks, all, kt
