MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT:       Expanded Family and Medical Leave Policies

        As you know, I have strongly supported meeting Federal employees' family and medical
needs through enactment of the Family and Medical Leave of 1993 (FMLA) and the Federal
Employees Family Friendly Leave Act of 1994 (FEFFLA). However, Federal employees often
have important family and medical needs which do not qualify for unpaid leave under the FMLA
or sick leave under the FEFFLA. I ask you to take immediate action to further assist Federal
workers in balancing the demands of work and family.

         Last year I prposed to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. My legislation
would allow Federal and eligible private sector workers 24 hours of unpaid leave each year to
fulfill certain family obligations. Under the legislation, employees could use unpaid leave,
scheduled 7 days in advance, to participate in school activities directly related to the educational
advancement of a child; accompany children to routine medical and dental examinations; and
tend to older relatives needs.

         I ask that you take immediate action to use your existing authorities to implement the
FMLA expansion set forth in the proposed legislation. Specifically, I ask that you ensure that
employees may schedule and be granted up to 24 hours of annual leave, compensatory time off,
credit hours under flexible work schedules, or leave without pay each year for the following
activities:

       (1) SCHOOL ACTIVITIES -- to allow employees to participate in school activities
       directly related to the educational advancement of a child. This would include
       parent-teacher conferences, interviewing for a new school, or participating in volunteer
       activities supporting the child's educational advancement. Here, as in my proposed
       legislation, "school" refers to an elementary school, secondary school, Head Start
       program, or a child care facility licensed under State law.

       (2) ROUTINE FAMIL Y MEDICAL PURPOSES -- to allow parents to accompany
       children to routine medical or dental appointments, such as annual checkups or
       vaccinations. Although these activities are not currently covered by the FMLA, the
       FEFFLA does permit employees to use up to 13 days of sick leave each year for such
       purposes. Agencies should assure that employees are able to use up to 24 hours of
       annual leave, compensatory time off, credit hours, or leave without pay for these purposes
       in the rare cases when sick leave is'not available to employees.

       (3) ELDERLY RELATIVES' HEALTH NEEDS -- to allow employees to accompany an
       elderly relative to routine medical appointments or other professional services related to
                                                                    He)(-Dump Conversion

       the care of the elderly relative, such as making arrangements for housing, meals, phones,
       banking services, and other similar activities, when these activities are not covered by the
       FMLA or the FEFFLA.

         This new policy will assure that employees can schedule and receive up to 24 hours
away from the job each year for these exceptional family and medical circumstances. To the
extent possible, I urge you to accommodate employee needs as mission requirements permit even
when it is not possible for employees to anticipate or schedule leave in advance for these
purposes.

I encourage you to use a partnership approach with your employees and their representatives in
developing an effective program that balances the employees need to succeed at work and at
home. I ask agencies, unions, and management associations to continue to work together to
assess and improve the use of family friendly programs and to make certain that employees are
aware of the expanded family and medical leave policy.
