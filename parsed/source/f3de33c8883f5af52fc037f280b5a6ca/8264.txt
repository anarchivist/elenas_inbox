     TEXT:
     It looks like the Hill is not going to send us the Child Support/Deadbeat
     Parents Act before POTUS leaves for China, which means that Wednesday
     morning is now open for the FDA announcement -- or if better suggestions
     come up fora message event on Wednesday, the FDA Commissioner
     announcement will be made Monday Monday morning before the President
     leaves for the Family Conference.

     Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for message
     events for Wednesday.
