Q:   Doesn't this mean that many of the policy proposals you've announced simply may
     not happen if there isn't tobacco legislation?

A:   No. As we've said all along, our budget proposal makes clear that these proposals
     can be fully paid for within the context of a balanced budget. Our budget assumes
     that Congress will pass tobacco legislation, and we believe that this is a realistic
     assumption. The budget we are sending to Congress includes a number of
     proposals to pay for our new initiatives -- including tax proposals and spending
     offsets. Of course, no offset proposed in a budget is guaranteed; Congress can
     reject any proposed way of financing a program. If Congress does not pass
     comprehensive tobacco legislation, we will work with Congress to find other offsets.
      This is a high Administration priority, and we will find an effective funding
     mechanism.

Q:   Why are some of the President's key priorities funded with tobacco money? Isn't
     this just a ploy to increase pressure on Congress to pass tobacco legislation? What
     is the Administration going to do if Congress doesn't pass a bill this year?

A:   First, let's remember that every initiative in our budget submission, including these,
     are paid for within the context of a balanced budget. The President is committed to
     that goal, and we'll simply find other offsets to support our key priorities if
     necessary. That's what happens in the budget process every year.

     But we expect Congress to pass tobacco legislation -- it has bipartisan support. So
     does funding for the NIH, and so does child care. We believe we're going to be able
     to work with Congress to pass these important initiatives.
