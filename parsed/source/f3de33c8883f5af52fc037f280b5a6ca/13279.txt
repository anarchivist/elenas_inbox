           SALVAGE LOGGING:  JUDGE LOOSENS PROTECTIONS FOR MURRELET
              A federal judge on 1/19 "threw out the protocol the US
        Forest Service used to keep loggers from cutting old-growth
        forests" where the threatened marbled murrelet is believed to be
        nesting. The ruling by US District Judge Michael Hogan was
        "another loss for environmentalists" fighting the salvage-logging
        law signed by Pres. Clinton in 7/95 (AP/mult., 1/21).
              The timber industry had asked the district court to order
        the release of dozens of timber sales being held up because of
        the murrelet. This request was opposed by the federal government
        and enviro groups (Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund release, 1/19).
                            CLARIFYING PROOF OF NESTING
              The salvage law stipulates that no logging can occur if the
        murrelet is "known to be nesting" in a timber sale unit
         (GREENWIRE sources). The scientific protocol used by the USFS to
        determine nesting areas was based on bird sightings, but the
        timber industry argued that nesting must be proven by finding
        physical evidence such as a nest or eggshell fragments.
              Hogan ruled that when Congress enacted the rider, it
        rejected the USFS protocol and put in place a new standard for
        judging whether murrelets are nesting in a timber sale. Hogan
