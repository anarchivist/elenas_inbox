. AT tHE SAVER SUMMIT PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES A NEW STEP
                  TO BOOST PENSION COVERAGE
                                             June 4,1998


        American workers generally need Social Security coverage, an employer-provided pension
        and personal retirement savings -- which constitute FDR 's famed three-legged stool of
        retirement security. Today, Social Security is the sole source of income for 18% ofsenior
        citizens and, for two-thirds of the elderly, it is the primary source of income. These figures
        show that we must do more to promote employer-provided pension coverage and increase
        personal retirement savings. This is the purpose of the SA VER Summit.
         ·      Today, President Clinton is announcing that under current law, employers can
                structure their 401(k) plans so that workers are in unless they opt out. Under
                standard practice, workers are out unless they opt to participate in the 401(k)
                plan.



PRESIDENT CLINTON'S RECORD OF EXPANDING AND PROTECTING PENSIONS. For
over five years, President Clinton has worked closely with the House and Senate, Democrats and
Republicans, to expand pension coverage, make pensions more secure, and simplify pension plan
administration.

The Retirement Protection Act of 1994, proposed by the Administration and passed by Congress,
protects the benefits of more than 40 million American workers and retirees. The ~mall Business Job
Protection Act of 1996 included measures that expanded pension coverage by creating a simplified
dermed contribution plan for small businesses that is proving to be a big hit, and also promoted
portability and streamlined pension plan administration.

THE NEED FOR ACTION. Despite these achievements, there is more to be done. And the
SAVER Summit will help to tum our nation's attention to the critical issue of private retirement
savings, focusing on the best methods to encourage workers to plan and save for retirement.

Thanks to President Clinton's efforts to eliminate the Federal budget deficit, the net national savings
rate has doubled -- from 3.1 % of gross domestic product in 1992 to 6.4% in 1997. CBO and OMB
both project that this year, the Federal budget will be in surplus for the first time in 30 years. While
net national savings are up,however, the personal savings rate is far too low.

In addition to lacking adequate personal savings, many workers also do not have pension coverage
through their employers:
·       Half of all American workers, more than 50 million, are not covered by a pension plan.
The problem of low pension coverage is especially acute for young and/or low and moderate income
workers.
·       Only 21 % of workers earning under $15,000 per year have pension coverage, as opposed
        to 81 % of workers earning $50,000 or more per year. [private sector workers only]
·       Just 15 percent of workers under age 25 are covered by a pension plan, compared to 58
        percent of workers age 35 to 49. [private sector workers only]
·       Only 24% offull-time workers in firms with fewer than 100 employees have pension
        coverage, as opposed to 68% of full-time workers in finns with 100 or more employees.
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
A NEW EFFORT TO INCREASE PENSION COVERAGE. The Clinton Administration is
taking another step to promote pension coverage, especially for workers of modest means. The
President is announcing that under current law, employers can structure their 401(k) plans so
that workers are in unless they opt out. Under standard practice, workers are out unless they
opt in to the 401(k) plan.

A number of employers have reportedly been deterred from establishing such automatic
enrollment 401(k) plans due to concern about whether this is allowable under current law; this
step responds to these concerns.

Automatic election works as follows:
·    A newly eligible employee is automatically enrolled in the 401(k) plan, with contributions
     through payroll deduction set at a standard percentage of pay.
·    The worker must be given notice of the automatic enrollment and have the opportunity to
     opt out (or change the contribution percentage) before the first deduction is made.
·    Employers would not be required to structure their 401(k) plans this way; the ruling only
     clarifies that firms have this option.

      ·      The information available suggests that for firms with automatic enrollment,
             participation rates in 401(k) plans are about 90 percent, compared to the overall
             401(k) participation rate of67 percent.

     .·       For some workers, the need to complete a 401(k) electionform - opting in - may be
              a deterrent to participation. Automatic enrollment gives employers an opportunity to
              encourage participation by eliminating this extra step.

BUILDS ON PRESIDENT'S PLAN TO EXPAND PENSION COVERAGE. This step builds on
initiatives that President Clinton proposed in his budget, all of which respond to the problem of
inadequate pension coverage and savings rates;

·     A tax credit for small businesses that adopt pension plans and a simplified defined benefit
      plan for small firms. Both of these proposals should boost pension coverage among small
      businesses, where coverage rates are lowest.
·     The Administration's pension package would also encourage those employers who do not
      offer a pension plan to give workers the option of contributing to individual retirement
      accounts (IRAs) through payroll deduction. This should be particularly helpful for
      low-income workers, who are disproportionately employed by fiims without pension plans.
·     Shortening the vesting period for employer 401(k) and other matching contributions from
      five to three years. This is particularly important for low and moderate income workers and
      women, whose average job tenure is less than men's.
