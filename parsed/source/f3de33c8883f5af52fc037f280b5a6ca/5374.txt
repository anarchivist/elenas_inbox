1. I'll check with Rahm on talking to Post and Times. Do it embargoed for
Sunday paper~, I don't care if it's background or record.

2. Be nice to Joan Huffer, but don't tell her too much about our big
surprises yet

3.   I know what you mean about the Zones, but Gene is going to take
another several weeks on the mentoring deal, so it's zones or nothing.
You don't have to firm up Dems for the tests until next year anyway, and
we"ll be for school construction, teachers, and mentors by Jan 28 at the
latest.   (We might be able to do teachers in mid-Dec, if we figure out
how. )

1. Have you had a chance to check with Rahm on whether I should talk
today to Peter Baker at the Times and Rene Sanchez at the Post, on an
embargoed basis. If we want them to be able to call Ravitch I should get
started on that soon, because she will take off this afternoon.

If I do this, should I talk on background or on the record?

2.   I indicated to Elena this morning that I think it would be a mistake


to announce the urban zones initiative as the first of our education
pieces. Regardless of its impact on the race dialogue, I'm convinced it
will make the job of solidifying (gaining?) key Dem. support for the tests
much more difficult.The social promotion stuff will just confirm their
worst fears.

far better for the long term prognosis for the testing initiative if we
led with the mentoring program, with a message along the following lines:
(1) we've made college affordable for all kids, now we just need to help
them get there; (2) here is my mentoring initiative that will give kids a
helping hand and let them take advantage of higher ed opportunities; (3)
we also need tough standards to help kids prepare for college--to make
sure that they learn something and are academically prepared to take advan
tge of the opportunities.
                                                                /

The school construction and class size initiatives will both help
tremendously with the opportunity crowd, but each time we talk about those
we should also talk about how they will create learning environments to
help kids reach high standards, and how we must have high standards to
make these big investments payoff.

In the context of these initiatives, we will have far less trouble with
our hard-edge no social promotion and other accountablity policies, and
far less trouble with the tests.

3. Joan Huffer from Daschle's office is calling me to find out what kind
of education agenda we are thinking about for next year. How much can I
tell her about what we are considering, with the usual caveats about
nothing yet actually decided?
