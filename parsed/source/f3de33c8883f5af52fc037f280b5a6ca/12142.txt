I would put the 2nd Whereas clause first--

Sect 3, if you are going to list federal law enf. agencies, you should
list all, for example OSI, NCIS, CID, EPA Investigators.

Subject: Draft Executive Order on Data Collection for Fed Law
Enforcement


 As discussed at our meeting on Wednesday, attached is a rough first
cut for an executive order that would require federal law enforcement
agencies to collect data on the use of race and national origin in covered
law enforcement activities.  We would like to circulate something to folks
at Treasury late today, if possible, so please forward me your comments
today so that they can be incorporated.   My fax number is 514-9962.
Thanks.
