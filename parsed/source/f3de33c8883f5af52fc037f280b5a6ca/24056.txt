  TEXT:
  FYI -- the chronology of the Administration's position on the child
  custody bill in the 105th Congress was as follows:

  June 24, 1998 - Justice letter (the one that is being circulated for
  clearance) was sent to the House Judiciary Committee.  The letter opposed
  the bill as drafted.

  July 8, 1998 - Chief-of-Staff Bowles sends a letter to Sen. Leahy on the
  Senate version of the bill strongly opposing the legislation.

  July 14, 1998 - SAP noting that if the bill fails to address the
  Administration's concerns, the President's senior advisers would recommend
  that he veto it.

  Last year's bill passed the House 276-150, but went no further in the
  Senate.

Subject:          Justice letter on Child Custody Bill

You will shortly receive via fax Justice's proposed letter for tomorrow
morning's markup of HR 1218, the Child Custody Protection Act. This
legislation would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines
to obtain an abortion in order to circumvent parental consent laws.

The Justice letter opposes the legislation and attaches its letter from
last year on HR 3682, an almost identical bill from 105th Congress.

Comments are due at 5:30 p.m.
