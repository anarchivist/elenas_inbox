TEXT:
Attached is a draft of the memo we discussed last night for your review.
The executive memorandum itself should probably be modified to include the
reference to balancing the budget, the interagency working group, and the
SOTU.  Nicole thought you had the latest version of the memo on your
computer.

As the memo is drafted, the executive memorandum would be calling for the
formation of an interagency working group that would have already met for
the first time a few days before.  This doesn't bother me, but I wanted to
flag it.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
                THE SECRETARY OF ....


FROM:           BRUCE REED
                Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:        Formation ofInteragency Working Group on Early Childhood Development


As the President announced in his State of the Union Address, he and the First Lady will hold a
White House Conference on Early Learning and the Brain this Spring, and the Administration
will be accelerating the its efforts focusing on the earliest years of a child's life before she or he
starts school. Recent brain research, funded in large part by the National Institutes of Health,
indicating the importance of these early years has potential policy implications in areas such as
education, health, nutrition, work, and transportation.

Before, during, and after the White House conference, the Administration will be highlighting
ongoing and new initiatives to support families and children during these critical, early years.
To this end, the President will be issuing an executive memorandum to identify the
Administration's accomplishments and current and potential plans to support further healthy
early childhood development. This memorandum will also call for the formation of a senior
level interagency working group to share, examine, and develop plans and proposals. Attached
is a draft of this memorandum.

We will hold the first meeting of this working group next Thursday, February 13, from 1:30-2:30
p.m. in Room 180 of the Old Executive Office Building. Please designate a Presidential
appointee to join this working group and to attend this meeting. Because the President will
formally issue the executive memorandum within days after this meeting, your designee should
provide comments on the memorandum before or at the meeting. In addition, designees should
bring with them a list of the top five programs or initiatives the agency would like to highlight.
Given the Administration's firm commitment to balancing the budget and fiscal discipline,
please indicate what, if any, additional funds would be required by these initiatives.

Feel free to contact me directly with any questions or have your staff contact Jeanine Smartt at
the Domestic Policy Council (202) 456-5228.
