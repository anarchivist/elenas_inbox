TEXT:
Along with FDA and Bill Schultz, we have been talking to the food safety
groups about the initiative. The groups had been fearful that FDA was
planning on turning over federal responsibility to the states, while
weakening federal inspection generally. After Carol Tucker Foreman and
Caroline Smith Dewall understood from FDA that the state program was
adding to, not subtracting from federal efforts, she and Caroline called
to say they are comfortable supporting the program.   Schultz thinks there
was a communication gap. Carol said they also wanted to talk to the head
of the parents group STOP tonight to get them on board as well, but that
the groups now understood and supported the project.
