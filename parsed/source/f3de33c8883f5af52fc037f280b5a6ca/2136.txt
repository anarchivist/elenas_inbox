TEXT:
Sylvia is out of the country, but not out of reach. She called to say the
President wants to aggressively pursue solving our Nicaraguan problem.
He's not going to say anything about it on this trip, but he would like us
to look into how we might try letting 100,000 illegals in for the next 3
yrs. Sylvia said members on the trip were pressing him in this direction.

Can we set in place a process to advise the President on this and any
other ideas he might corne up with over the course of this expedition?
Sylvia thought we should give him advice next week if possible.
