Draft April 4, 1997,                                                 Confidential

                                  FACT SHEET
      President Clinton's Petition To. The Federal Election CommissionTo
                                Ban 'Soft Money'
                                           April -' 1997


        Today, the President petitioned the Federal Election Coinmission (FEC) to revisit its rules
on 'soft money' and act to ban the use of soft money in federal elections, as proposed in
bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation now before Congress. The petition proposes to
end the current soft money system by requiring that candidates for federal office and national
parties only be permitted to raise and spend 'hard money' -- funds subject to the restrictions,
contribution limits, and reporting requirements of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA). This ban would apply to all political party committees, as anticipated by the
bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation.


'Soft money' and federal elections

        Soft money plays an increasingly large role in funding political parties and campaigns.
So-called hard money contributions are those that are given to candidates or parties subject to the
limits and disclosure offederallaw. Soft money, on the other hand, goes to national or state
political parties, and can be raised in large amounts and from sources that could not give under
federal election law (directly from corporations and unions).

      The role of soft money has grown dramatically in the past several elections. In 1996, the
Democratic Party raised $123 million, and the Republican Party raised $138 million in soft
money -- more than triple the total of four years before.

        Soft money is today lawful under a series of regulations put forward by the Federal
Election Commission (FEC). The FEC first issued advisory opinions on this in 1978. It did not
take further action during the 1980's, as the role of soft money grew. In 1990, ordered to take
some action on soft money by a federal court, the FEC promulgated regulations that govern how
parties can allocate funds between federal and non-federal activities. (The court deferred to the
agency as to how to address the issue, but noted that the agency could go as far as to ban the use
of soft money for mixed federal- and state-political activity.)

     In addition, the 1979 statutory amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA) authorized allocation of national and state hard money for joint activities.

President Clinton's support for a soft money ban

     President Clinton has consistently called for legislation that would ban the use of soft
money in federal elections. He called for this legislation during the 1992 campaign, and
                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


supported the campaign finance refonn legislaiton thatt was vetoed that year by President Bush
(which would have banned soft money). The campaign finance refonn plan he proposed in May
1993 included a soft money ban; this proposal was passed by both chambers but was killed by a
Senate filibuster in 1994.

        The bipartisan campaign finance refonn legislation introduced by Senators McCain and
Feingold and Representatives Shays and Meehan would prohibit the use of soft money in federal
elections.

       In January, 1993, the Democratic National Committee voluntarily announced that it
would restrict contributions it can currently accept under the law. It would not accept soft
money contributions in excess of $1 00,000 per year, and it would not accept contributions from
individuals who are not citizens or from domestic subsidiaries offoreign corporations.

Contents of the request to the FEC

        The President will call on Congress to enact the bipartisan legislation to refonn campaign
financing and ban soft money. In the meantime, he is fonnally requesting the FEC to act now,
under existing law, to write new regulations banning the use of soft money to influence federal
elections, as envisioned in the legislation. Specifically, the President is requesting that the
Commission consider new rulemaking to accomplish the following:

·      Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or agents)
       from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of
       FECA. (This would preclude, for example, contributions directly from corporate or
       union treasuries, or contributions from individuals in excess of the amount an individual
       can give to a national parties federal account.)

·      Prohibit any federal officeholder or candidate (and their agents) from soliciting or
       receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FECA.

·      Provide that any amount of funds expended by a political party during a federal election
       year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter registration or
       get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising, or any communication that refers to a federal
       candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA. (This would end the
       allocation system, currently authorized by the FEC, under which hard and soft money are
       mixed for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)
