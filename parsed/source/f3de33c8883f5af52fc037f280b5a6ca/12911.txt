         TEXT:
         The following was discussed at the message meeting this afternoon:

         1. POTUS will do a short live video feed (speechwriters say 5-7 minutes
         though Mickey is pushing for 15) for Friday afternoon opening session.
         Right now, that's scheduled for about 4 p.m. (probably because of news
         conference Friday afternoon), in which case POTUS would follow Senator
         McCain. There was some interest in having POTUS go earlier.   Speech would
         review our accomplishments for cities, featuring the good news in the
         State of the Cities report, make case for New Markets initiative, and
         highlight how the Republican budget would be bad for cities.  May want
         POTUS and/or VP to highlight guns depending on what's going on on the
         Hill. We'll give speechwriters a sentence to praise USCM for their support
         for WtW reauthorization and urge them to do more. IGA will also push for
         this (though they'd left it off their initial list).

         Right now the plan is to leak a story Thursday for Friday that previews
         the key points in the State of the Cities report to be highlighted by
         POTUS and delivered in more detail on Saturday by Cuomo.  Jen and Loretta
         will coordinate with HUD to make sure they're "on message" and that the
         focus stays positive.

         2. VP gives speech Monday. Will build on themes in State of Cities,
         particularly about importance of urban/suburban regional cooperation and
         livability, but main message will be education (urban schools). Sounds


like they're still exploring specific announcement (Jon/Tanya - you
probably know more) .

3. Paper to be done by COB Tuesday:
1 pager summarizing State of Cities (DPC to work with HUD)
Impact of Republican budget cuts on cities (NEC to pull from earlier
document they did with OMB)
Administration's urban accomplishments (DPC and NEC to update previous
documents)
Administration's FY 2000 budget initiatives that help cities (NEC, with
help from DPC)
Press paper summarizing State of Cities and budget cuts (NEC and DPC)

4.  Cabinet Affairs/IGA/Speechwriters to do joint conference call with
agencies on Wednesday.

Paul, let's discuss assignments.
