TEXT:
Just a head up that, in an interview with NPR tomorrow at 10 a.m.,
Governor Carper will announce the results of the first survey conducted by
the Wirthlin group of 400 business partners' attitude towards welfare
reform.  The survey was conducted at the request of the governors on the
Partnership's National Advisory Council (now includes 26), chaired by
Governors Thompson and Carper, to provide direct feedback from businesses
to government officials on the successes and challenges of welfare reform
and hiring former welfare recipients.   Results are positive, but support
that we have more work to do on tax credits and transportation.
Highlights (excerpted from talking points Partnership staff prepared for
Carper) include:
Businesses are hiring and will continue to hire--79% of those interviewed
expect to hire someone off welfare this year.
Welfare recipients make successful employees--76% of those who have hired
found their new hires are good, productive employees.
Welfare recipients are getting full-time jobs with benefits--72% of
companies that hire are hiring into full-time positions and 72% provide
new hires with medical benefits.
Some businesses are using tax credits, but need more information--12% of
small companies and 31% of large companies are using the WOTC or WtW Tax
Credits.  Those that are not need more information.   (NOTE: the


partnership has created four toll-free tax credit hotlines to provide
information to small businesses) .
We still must work to overcome transportation problems--51% of the
companies consider employee transportation a problem, with more than a
third saying it's a serious problem (NOTE: we've suggested Carper mention
Access to Jobs initiative and funding status in Congress here) .
