    TEXT:
    FYI -- OMB has just notified us that the Wellstone amendment passed the
    Senate 55-43:

    Adding to the welfare work options postsecondary education or vocational
    education not to exceed 24 months (previously only 12 months of voc ed
    counted)

    Expanding the educational cap by removing teen parents in high school from
    the no more than 30 percent of all work participants that can be in
    education (previously, both teen parents in high school and those in voc
    ed counted toward the 30 percent cap) .
