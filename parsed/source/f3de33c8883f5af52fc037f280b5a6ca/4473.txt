TEXT:
Unfortunately, the CHC staff mtg only convenes once a month and cannot
reschedule.  I asked Janet and she said worst case scenario-- if neither
Jen nor Nicole can make the mtg-- she would like to have both Cynthia and
Elena at the mtg.  She did ask that both Jen and Nicole try to be at the
mtg if at all possible. Apparently, the CHC has prepared and Becerra's
office has made a special effort to turn out its staff for the mtg. Janet
wants to make sure that the Administration is well represented.
