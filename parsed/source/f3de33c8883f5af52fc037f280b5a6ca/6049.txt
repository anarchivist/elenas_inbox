TEXT:
Larry Stein called me on Thursday and Friday about the Medicare
Commission.  During the discussions, he repeatedly said he was growing
increasingly concerned that the tobacco legislation was becoming more and
more difficult to see how we could get to closure. He said that he
thought another legislative strategy meeting was advisable.   I said that I
would pass on to you.  Do you think you have had enough of .these or do you
think we should set something up?  I am getting the sense that we need to
do something to coordinate ourselves internally and on the Hill and would
advise that you give Larry a call.

I have a need to do something like this on the quality front        as well.  I
would like to bring in Rich, John H., Janet M., and Larry to        discuss
options.· Would you two like to sit in on such a meeting?  I        would welcome
your participation.  Call or write when you can, and we will        set up.
Thanks.
