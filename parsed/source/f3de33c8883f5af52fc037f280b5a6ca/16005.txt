TEXT:
Today, AMA and ACOG released a joint statement on HR 1122. The statement
highlights where the two organizations agree and disagree to assure that
interested parties get a fair understanding of the exact nature of their
disagreements.

They state that although they took different positions on the legislation
they agree that clarity in definition is critical to any legislation
prescribing the conduct of physicians, particularly when the penalties are
criminal.  If the application of the statute expands beyond what AMA
believes is the intent, AMA and ACOG, will oppose such applications and
will fully support any physician who is prosecuted.
