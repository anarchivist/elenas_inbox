TEXT:
I have talked to DOJ about the wording for interrogatory #5.
Peter Coppelman and Ellen, who argued last week's motions in front
of Judge Hogan. They feel very strongly that while we are
technically correct in our proposed modification to the response
because Rutzick didn't phrase his question correctly, it is too
cute by half to take advantage of that and that we need an
explanation of why no WH, EOP or CEQ names appear in the response.
DOJ believes Hogan wi without an explanation, Hogan will consider
it nonresponsive, with ill consequences towards the gov.   I am not
inclined to die over this, but if either of you are, now is the
time - otherwise, it's out the door.
