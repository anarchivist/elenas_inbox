TEXT:
Last Thursday, Congo Riggs introduced a problematic, partisan Head Start
reauthorization bill scheduled for mark-up in full committee this
Wednesday. (The Senate already marked up its reauthorization bill, which,
after negotiation, is both bipartisan and consistent with the President's
budget and policy.)   HHS is drafting a letter from Shalala to the House
Ed and Workforce Committee outlining our significant concerns with the
bill as introduced, which include:

(1) Bill is inconsistent with the President's budget request (underfunded);
 (2) Bill restricts Head Start expansion, denying Head Start services to
tens of thousands of children and curtailing expansion of Early Head Start
(it significantly increases the quality set-aside for expansion dollars
(from 25% in current law to 75% in FY 1999), and mandates full-day,
full-year services for all kids currently in Head Start before any
expansion to new kids);
(3) Bill opens up Head Start to vouchers (by enabling the Secretary to
provide certificates to parents for comparable services);
(4) Bill increases Governor authority; and
(4) Bill includes partisan provisions such as repeal of the Davis-Bacon
requirement, and attacks on bilingual education.

Bruce, HHS may request that in the coming days you call Dems (such as
Congo Roemer) to express our strong concerns, if you are willing.
