                                    PATIENTS BILL OF RIGHTS
                                          March 17, 1999


     Q:   What is the President's response to the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation that will
          be marked up by the Senate Labor Committee this Wednesday?

     A:   Today represents the first test of this new Congress to see if it is serious about patient
          protections. The President is urging that the Committee take the steps it needs to take to
          pass this test.

          Unfortunately, while we have not seen the details of the legislation Senator Jeffords
          intends to mark up today, all indications are that it will fall far short of passing the test of
          seriousness when it comes to meeting the needs of patients in a rapidly changing health
          care system. We understand that the Chairman's plan:

          I. leaves tens of millions of Americans without protections because they will not be
          covered by the legislation;

          2. does not have a standard to prevent HMOs from making arbitrary coverage decisions;
          and

          3. has a wholly inadequate mechanism for enforcing patients'rights.

          This helps explains why every major patient, doctor, and nurse advocacy organization has
          concluded that Chairman Jeffords' proposal is flawed and will not adequately protect
          patients.

          Senator Kennedy and the rest of the Committee Democrats are planning on offering
          amendments that, if passed, would make this legislation acceptable to the President
          by addressing these issues. It is our hope that Senator Jeffords and the rest ofthe
          Committee will work toward passing a strong, comprehensive, and bipartisan Patients
          Bill of Rights that the President can sign.
