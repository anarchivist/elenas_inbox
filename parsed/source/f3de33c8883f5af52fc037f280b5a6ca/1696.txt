Subject:         Re: separate immigration bill

Re your note below and my earlier response this morning, we have asked HHS
to prepare the immigration provisions as a freestanding bill for HHS to
transmit to Congress on behalf of HHS, SSA, and USDA.  We asked that the
bill be submitted to OMB by no later than c.o.b. on this Wednesday, and
the HHS staff has agreed to do so.  This gets the ball rolling and does
not preclude "White House [Presidential] transmittal" of the bill if your
final guidance is to do so.
