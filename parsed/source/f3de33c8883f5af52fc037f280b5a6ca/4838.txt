TEXT:
This is to confess that I have fallen far behind the timeline you set out
at the last meeting you attended on this subject -- that we get the draft
into clearance by October 3. The only thing I can say in my defense is
that the process has continued to be fairly excruciating at every step.
Here's the latest status.

The major outstanding issue is now funding. All the smart people want DOL
to chair it, and DOL is willing to do so IF we can settle the budget and
the source of funds.  But DOL and OMB are having a chicken-and-egg
argument about who should be first to estimate what the task force would
cost.   DOL refuses to have this put into clearance with them listed as
chair until this is settled, and everyone thinks it's a bit wacky to put
it into clearance with a blank where the chair ought to be. DOL also
wants a meeting with all the top people at agencies in the task force
(Thurm, Apfel, Higgins, Mike Smith, etc.) to "validate" this -- which
should be a nightmare to put together.

I will keep pushing, but if we don't get it into· clearance in the next few
days, it will be impossible to issue this in October. That's not the end
of the world, but I would like to get this settled.   If you think I should
just put it into clearance without a chair, or ignore Seth and put in
DOL's name, let me know.

P.S. The other messy issue is on the good idea of having Defense's nice
computer accommodations program service all the agencies. Turns out that
this can't be done by executive order, according to OMB general counsel,
and I suspect they're right. So it looks like we have to turn this into. a
legislative proposal, which I will try to do to coincide with the release
of the EO.
