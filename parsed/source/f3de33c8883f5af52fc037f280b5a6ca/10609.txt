Possible State of the Union Welfare Announcements

(1) Caseloads Continue Their Record Declines: Unveil new caseload data showing the welfare
rolls have fallen below 8 million for the first time since 1969 and have fallen nearly 2 million
since last year's State of the Union. The welfare rolls have declined by 43 percent. since January
1993, when they stood at 14.1 million, and by 35 percent since their August 1996. The
percentage of the U.S. population on welfare is at its lowest since 1968 -- 2.9 percent.

(2) More Welfare Recipients are Working than Ever Before: Data released December 30th
shows nearly every state is meeting the welfare law's overall work requirement (requiring 25
percent of all welfare families with an adult to·work). Data also show the percentage of welfare
recipients working has greatly increased. Since 1992, the percentage of adults on welfare in
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion


direct work activities -- employment, work experience, and community service -- has tripled,
rising from 7 percent in 1992 to nearly 22 percent in 1997. Nationwide, 28 percent of all adults
on welfare are participating in direct work activities or other welfare-to-work activities, such as
vocational training, and nearly every state met the law's 25 percent participation rate for FY
1997. (Source: Caseload data reported by the states to HHS.)

Estimates based on Census Bureau data show that 1.5 million individuals who received welfare
in 1997 were working in March 1998. This reflects an impressive 28 percent increase since
1996 in the percentage of people Who were on welfare in one year and working the following
year -- from 26.5 percent in 1996 to 33.8 percent in 1998. (Source: HHS calculations of Census Bureau
data.)

Census Bureau data also show a dramatic shift towards employment among welfare recipients:
the percentage of single women on welfare who were working increased by 50 percent from 1992
to 1997. In 1992, 40% of single women on welfare had earnings from employment and 60% did
not; by 1997, these ratios had switched and 60% of single women on welfare had earnings from
employment while 40% did not. In addition, the Census Bureau data show that the proportion of
single mothers working has increased dramatically since 1992 and the number of women
receiving welfare and not working has decreased dramatically. (Source: Harvard University Professor
Jeffrey B. Liebman's calculations using Census Bureau Current Population Survey data. The data from 1996 and
earlier appeared in Table III of his article "The Impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit on Incentives and Income
Distribution" Tax Policy and the Economy, 12,83-119.)

(3) The Public and Private Sectors Are Hiring from the Welfare Rolls. Announce that the
Welfare to Work Partnership has met the President's challenge to sign up 10,000
businesses, and (possibly) that federal agencies have met the challenge to hire 10,000
welfare recipients -- ahead of the target date of 2000 (we'll know by the first week of
January if we've met the federal hiring goal).

                            President's Statements

 Welfare Bill Signing       "Now that we are saying with this bill we expect work, we have to make sure the
 (8/96)                     people have a chance to go to work. If we really value work, everybody in this
                            society -- businesses, non-profits, religious institutions, individuals, those in
                            government -- all have a responsibility to make sure the jobs are there."

 1997 State of Union        "To every employer in our country who ever criticized the old welfare system, you
                            can't blame that old system anymore, we have tom it down. Now do your part. Give
                            someone on welfare the chance to go to work. Tonight, I am pleased to announce that
                            five major corporations -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King and United
                            Airlines -- will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal America's
                            businesses, large and small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to
                            work."

 Cabinet Meeting on         Announced plan to hire 10,000 welfare recipients in the federal government by
 Federal Hiring of          the year 2000, an effort to be led by the Vice President (this announcement was
 Welfare Recipients         the result of a Presidential directive issued 3/8/97 for agencies to develop welfare
 (4/10/97)                  to work hiring plans).
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


 Welfare to Work       Announced the Partnership had grown from 5 to 105 companies and set a goal of
 Partnership Launch    achieving 1,000 within a year_
 (5/20/97)

 1998 State of Union   "We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success -- providing
                       child care, helping families move closer to available jobs, challenging more companies
                       to join our welfare-to-work partnership, increasing child support collections from
                       deadbeat parents who have a duty to support their own children."

 Welfare to Work       Announced the Partnership had grown from 105 to 5,000 companies and that
 Partnership           Partnership companies had hired 135,000 welfare recipients in 1997. The
 Anniversary           President challenged the Partnership to double its number of hires and the
 (5/27/98)             number of companies participating. The President also announced that federal
                       government has hired 4,800 people from welfare to work in the last year, of the goal of
                       10,000 by the year 2000.


(4) We Must do More to Ensure Those Still on the Rolls Go to Work. Announce our
proposal for $1 billion more in Welfare-to-Work funds to help those welfare recipients still
on the rolls who face the greatest challenges get jobs and succeed in the work force. This
revised program will contain a new emphasis on increasing the employment of low income
fathers so they can better meet their responsibilities to their children, with a minimum of $150
million for Responsible Fatherhood Grants. (See separate one pager for more details.)
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


(4) New Resources for Child Support Crackdown. Unveil a new child support law
enforcement initiative to double the number of prosecutions of egregious child support
violators by providing resources to identify, investigate, and prosecute these cases. This effort will
be part of a challenge to law enforcement in every state to join our national effort to ensure
America's children receive the support that they need and deserve. (See one pager for more
details -- level of funding is still undecided, so it's unclear if we can pledge to double the
number of prosecutions.)

We may also be able to release new 1998 figures showing additional increases in child
support collections. (We do not have these data yet but are working on getting them by
early January. These data will update our current statistics showing a 68 percent increase
in child support collections since the President took office, which are based on 1992-1997
comparison).

                        President's Statements

 1996 State of the      "In particular, I challenge the fathers of this country to love and care for their children.
 Union                   If your family has separated, you must pay your child support. We're doing more
                        than ever to make sure you do, and we're going to do more, but let's all admit
                        something about that, too: A check will not substitute for a parent's love and
                        guidance. And only you -- only you can make the decision to help raise your children.
                         No matter who you are, how low or high your station in life, it is the most basic
                        human duty of every American to do that job to the best of his or her ability."

 Welfare Bill Signing   "It's the most sweeping crackdown on deadbeat parents in history .... With this bill we
 (8/96)                 say, if you don't pay the child support you owe we'll garnish your wages, take away
                        your driver's license, track you across state lines; if necessary, make you work off what
                        you pay -- what you owe. It is a good thing and it will help dramatically to reduce
                        welfare, increase independence, and reenforce parental responsibility."

 1997 State of Union    "In the last four years, we have increased child support collections by 50 percent.
                        Now we should go further and do better by making it a felony for any parent to cross a
                        state line in an attempt to flee from this, his or her most sacred obligation."

 1998 State of Union    "We still have a lot more to do, all of us, to make welfare reform a success -- providing
