                                                                         Hex-Dump COi!version

    DOT is ready to deliver to the White House a report you requested on measures to increase seat
    belt use. I am seeking your clearance of a key proposal in the report. The report will set an
    ambitous national goal for belt use (85% by 2000). To reach the goal, DOT is proposing, among
    other things, that the Administration send legislation to Congress giving states a stonger
    incentive to pass primary seat belt laws (i.e. laws that allow for ticketing soley for failure to use
    a seat belt). The NEXTEA bill you announced March 12 includes financial incentives (grants)
    for states to adopt primary seat belt laws. The new porposal would add a "soft sanction" -- states
    that do not pass primary laws or achieve 85% belt use by October, 2002, would have 1.5% of
    their federal highway funds (3% in subsequent years) transferred into their highway safety
    programs.

    The proposal is likely to be effective, since primary belt laws significantly increase belt use and
    sanctions have effectively moved states to enact safety laws (e.g. zero tolerance laws). Eleven
    states and DC already have primary seat belt laws, covering a third of all Americans. Belt use in
    these states is 15% higher than in states with secondary enforcement laws. NHTSA estimates
    that enactment of a primary law by the remaining 39 states would save 1,800 lives in the first
    year alone.

    The NGA and the governors' safety offices oppose the proposal (Governors Voinovich and Bob
    Miller sent a letter to Frank Raines) as they have opposed other sanctions. The National
    Mortorists Association, individual liberties groupus, and conservative and western Members of
    Congress who allied to repeal sanctions in 1995 are also expected to oppose it. A broad
    coalition will support the proposal, including auto maufacturers, insurance companies, safety
    advocates, health groups, law enforcement officials, and the National Urban League. DOT
    believes the proposal has a very good chance of getting congressional approval, particularly
    because the air bag issue has focused public attention on the importance of seat belts.

    Given your and Secretary Slater's commitment to improving auto safety and the expected benefits
    of the proposal, I recommend you support it.
