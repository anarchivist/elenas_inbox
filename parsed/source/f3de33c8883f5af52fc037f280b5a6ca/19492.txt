STATEMENT OF JOHN R. FRASER
DEPUTY WAGE AND HOUR ADMINISTRATOR
EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
BEFORE THE
SUBCOMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION AND CLAIMS
OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

April 21, 1998


Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:


         We appreciate this opportunity to share the views of the
Administration on whether this countryD,s important high-technology
industry should be afforded increased access to temporary foreign workers
to meet its growing demand for highly skilled workers.   In doing so, I
want to again call your attention to the need to strengthen our education
and training system to provide u.s. workers with the opportunity to
acquire the skills needed to compete in our rapidly changing economy and
the need pressing for reform of the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program.
         Our information technology (IT) industry is essential to our
continuing strong economic growth and wider prosperity. Our interest in
the industryO,s strength is evidenced by our participation in a recent
convocation in Berkeley that assessed IT work force needs.   Further, as
you know from Administration proposals advanced since 1993, we believe
that the H-1B program needs fundamental reform.   I would like to commend
the Subcommittee for its interest in these issues.
         We believe the issue of whether to increase the IT industryD,s
access to temporary foreign workers should be evaluated within the
framework of the following three questions:
 (1)     Is there a shortage of skilled u.S. workers to fill jobs in the
IT industry and meet future workforce needs?
 (2)     What would be the consequences of raising the annual H-1B cap?
 (3)     Does the current H-1B program need to be reformed in order to
provide industry appropriate access to temporary foreign workers while
protecting the job opportunities, wages and working conditions of u.S.
workers?
I will address each of these in turn.
Tight Labor Markets and IT Skills Shortages
         Proponents of increasing the annual cap on H-1B visas argue that
this increase is necessary for the IT industry to be able to overcome an
acute shortage of skilled u.S. workers.   While there is no dispute that
there is strong growth in demand for workers in the IT industry, it is
much less clear that there is a shortage of skilled u.S. workers to meet
this demand or that the domestic labor market wonO,t be able _[l) as it has
over the last decade -0) to satisfy projected job growth.
         u.s. employment has been growing rapidly, labor markets are
increasingly tight, and they are likely to remain so.   Though this is true
for the nation as a whole, IT labor markets appear to be particularly
affected.   Employment opportunities for computer systems analysts,
engineers, and scientists have been growing by 10 percent a year 0* well
above the growth of comparable occupations 0* and are expected to
continue growing at a comparable rate through 2006. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) predicts that the u.S. will require more than 1.3 million
new workers in IT core occupations between 1996 and 2006 to fill job
openings projected to occur due to growth and the need to replace workers
who leave the labor force or transfer to other occupations.
         The IT skills shortage issue is very controversial.  Some industry
advocates assert that there exist more than three hundred thousand
unfilled jobs within the IT industry, and that these vacancies are raising
business costs and hurting u.S. competitiveness.   On the other hand,
critics argue that the IT industry: (1) overstates the problem by
producing inflated job vacancy data and equating it to skills shortages;
(2) continues to layoff tens of thousands of workers (e.g., Intel,
Netscape, Cypress Semiconductor and Silicon Graphics recently announced
large lay-offs); and (3) fails to tap reservoirs of available talent by
insisting on unnecessarily specific job requirements and not providing
more training to develop incumbent workers~, skills.
         Equating job vacancies and actual skills shortages is particularly
controversial. While an industry association-sponsored survey indicates
that there may be as many as 350,000 job vacancies in the IT industry, as
you will hear, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has concluded that this


does not necessarily signal an acute shortage of skilled workers.    In
fact, most industries and firms (particularly those with rapid employment
growth and high worker turnover) will have large numbers of job openings
that do not indicate skills shortages.
         While higher than average wage growth can be a reliable indicator
of skill shortages, the wage growth record for the IT industry is mixed.
Though BLS wage trends for broad computer-related categories show only
average wage growth between 1988 and 1997 for all categories, it only
shows above-average wage growth in 1996 and 1997 and only in the
lower-skill computer-related categories, such as programmers.    At the same
time, a variety of industry wage surveys show larger wage increases in
1996 and 1997 in specialized, high-skill occupations.
         The Commerce DepartmentO,s September 1997 report and the
subsequent GAO evaluation of that report both were inconclusive on the
issue of a shortage of U.S. workers with IT skills and both concluded that
more information and data are needed to understand and properly
characterize the IT labor market.
         The Subcommittee should also take into consideration other factors
that bear on the question of the scope and duration of any labor shortage
in the IT industry:
The current O&Year 200008 problem is now occupying thousands of IT workers
for the short-term;
New technologies are being introduced that are creating more efficient
ways to produce software, store and retrieve data, speed up computations,
and generally improve the productivity of the IT work force;
The number of computer science enrollments has risen significantly in the
last two years and nearly three-quarters of all IT workers got their
education in other disciplines.
Consequences of Raising the H-1B Visa CAP
         We strongly urge that any decision to raise the H-1B visa cap
carefully consider the possible adverse impact of such a move on the
normal process by which labor markets adjust to a growing demand for
workers. The labor market should be permitted to adjust to this increased
demand without the introduction of artificial factors (such as increasing
access to temporary foreign workers) that could delay, if not prevent,
these normal market adjustments.   Indeed, the IT labor market has already
begun to respond to the signals of increased demand. A survey of U.S.
Ph.D. departments of computer science and computer engineering showed
bachelor-level enrollments were up 46% in 1996, and another 39% in 1997
nearly doubling over the two year period (q: does this include foreign
students?) .
         It is also important to remember that tight labor markets are good
for U.S. workers. A tight labor market causes employers to raise wages,
improve working conditions, and provide increased training to enable
currently employed workers to keep pace with technology.   An increased
demand for trained workers induces educational and job training
institutions to teach new skills. With more opportunities for training,
workers acquire skills needed to obtain better, higher-paying and more
secure jobs, thereby creating open jobs and career ladders for those just
entering or reentering the labor market (e.g., young people, welfare
recipients, displaced workers, and other disadvantaged groups) .
Therefore, tight labor markets create incentives for employers and workers
to react in ways needed to achieve many of the NationO,s top priorities:
moving welfare recipients, out-of-school youth, and dislocated workers
into jobs; providing greater opportunities for lifelong learning; and
raising wages and reducing income inequality.
        However, while tight labor markets are good for U.S. workers,
labor markets can sometimes be slow to respond to skills shortages.    In
these circumstances, it is often argued that temporary foreign workers are
needed in the short-term to provide necessary skills while the labor


market adjusts to provide U.S. workers with the requisite training.
Without needed foreign temporary workers, industries experiencing genuine
skill shortages may adjust in ways that do not serve the short-term or
long-term priorities of the country, either by reducing job creation or by
moving jobs overseas.   Further, because the IT sector is so critical to
our global competitive edge, the U.S. economy could suffer
disproportionate harm if skill shortages do become acute.
         Because the expanded use of foreign temporary workers may
interfere with labor market adjustments and may make achieving our other
priorities more difficult, we must make sure that any increase in the
annual number of foreign temporary workers is done with care to ensure
that the use of these foreign temporary workers is responding to a genuine
skill shortage and does not interfere with healthy adjustments in the
labor market.
         We must also be cognizant that raising the H-lB cap will almost
certainly increase both legal and illegal immigration. We know that
nearly half of the workers who obtain permanent residency in the US as
employment-based immigrants convert from H-visa nonimmigrant status.    And
according to the INS statistics, nearly one-half of all illegal aliens
resident in the United States are visa over-stayers. With the attachments
and equity they will form in the U.S. during their nonimmigrant stay of 6
years (or more), one can expect many of the additional H-lB entrants will
eventually join the ranks of visa over-stayers.
         The Department of Labor has heard from many concerned individuals
and groups on the issue of the adverse impact on U.S. workers of raising
the annual cap on H-lB visas. I would like to request that copies of the
many letters we have received from these people be included in the record
of todayD,s hearing.
         The Administration believes that our first response to meeting the
workforce needs of the IT industry should be' to provide the needed skills
to U.S. workers to qualify them for IT jobs. The Administration already
has taken significant steps to increase our capacity to enhance workforce
skills.   The President continues to pursue comprehensive reform of the
NationO,s employment and training system by working with Congress to enact
the principles embodied in his GI Bill proposal.   Moreover, in the
historic balanced budget agreement of last summer, the President insisted
on and achieved the largest increase in 30 years in the Federal investment
to expand the skills of American workers, including:
the largest Pell Grant increase in two decades;
Hope Scholarships to make the first two years of post-secondary education
universally available;
the Lifelong Learning Tax Credit for the last 2 years of college and
continuing adult education and training to upgrade worker skills;
a major increase in employment and training resources, including increases
for dislocated workers and disadvantaged adults and youth; and
a $3 billion program to help long-term welfare recipients secure lasting,
unsubsidized employment.
         Further, the Administration announced several new initiatives at
the recent Berkeley Convocation to help address the growing demand for IT
workers:
A Labor Department Technology Demonstration project to test innovative
ways of establishing partnerships between local workforce development
systems, employers, training providers and others to train dislocated
workers in needed high tech skills;
The expansion and integration of AmericaD,s Job Bank and AmericaO,s Talent
Bank to allow employers and workers to list and access job openings and
worker resumes in one integrated system;
The convening of four town hall meetings by the Commerce Department to
discuss IT workforce needs, identify innovative practices, and showcase
successful models; and


                 In addition, last week President Clinton and Secretary
Herman announced that grants, totaling $1.6 million, are being provided to
projects in four states to continue highly successful programs to train
dislocated workers for high paying jobs in information technology.
         Finally, with the Technology Literacy Challenge and related
educational programs, the Administration has put strong emphasis on
effective use of educational technology to strengthen our nationO,s
schools and school-to-work transition. Linking elementary/secondary
schools, institutions of higher education, and business can produce the
knowledge, know-how, and skills our nationO,s businesses and young people
need in IT. This creates opportunities for business and American,s
students alike. [need more information on this to be able to answer
questions. ]
         We believe that there is more that can be done to move U.S.
workers into high technology jobs, and we welcome the discussions that may
be sparked by this hearing. We are committed to continuing to pursue a
dialogue with the major stakeholders on this critical workforce issue 0*
government, industry, workers, and education and training institutions 0*
to better define the workforce needs of the IT industry and develop
appropriate solutions to meet these needs domestically through commitments
from each of the stakeholders.
         In sum, Mr. Chairman, our assessment of the likely effects of
raising the H-IB cap reconfirms our strong conviction that our primary
public policy response to skills mismatches due to changing technologies
and economic restructuring must be to prepare the U.S. workforce to meet
new demands.   Yet we recognize that short-term demands for skills may
require that we develop a balanced, short-term, response to meet urgent
needs while we actively adjust to rapidly changing circumstances.
However, increased numbers of temporary foreign workers should be the last
0* not the first 0* public policy response to skills shortages.
         Given this broader context, let me now turn to the third of the
issues I listed 0* the pressing need for reform of the H-1B nonimmigrant
program.
H-1B Nonimmigrant Program Must be Reformed
         The H-1B visa program allows the admission of up to 65,000 workers
each year (to stay for as long as six years), to meet short-term,
high-skills employment needs in the domestic labor market. Temporary visa
programs, like H-1B, are intended to allow employers who are faced with a
domestic skills shortage to have access to temporary foreign workers with
the requisite skills while the domestic labor market makes appropriate
adjustments.
         However, there exist serious structural flaws in the current H-1B
program. These flaws are documented in a May 1996 report by the
DepartmentO,s Inspector General (IG).   I would ask the Subcommittee to
accept the IGO,s full report in the record of todayO,s hearing.
         The IG found that, despite the legislative intent:
0& . . . the [H-1B] program does not always meet urgent, short-term demand
for highly-skilled, unique individuals who are not available in the
domestic work force.   Instead, it serves as a probationary try-out
employment program for illegal aliens, foreign students, and foreign
visitors to determine if they will be sponsored for permanent status.OB

        The IG also found that O&some [H-1B] employers use alien labor to
reduce payroll costs either by paying less than the prevailing wage to
their own alien employees or treating these aliens as independent
contractors, thereby avoiding related payroll and administrative costs.[JB
It found, in addition, that D&other [H-1B] employers are D+job shopsD,
whose business is to provide H-1B alien contract labor to other
employers.OB The IG concluded that the H-1B program does little to
protect the jobs or wage of U.S. workers and it recommended eliminating


the current program and establishing a new program to fulfill CongressD,
intent.
         Employers obtain H-1B workers by simply filing a labor condition
application (LCA) with the Department affirming that they have complied
with four requirements:
that the higher of the local prevailing rate or the wage paid to the
employer's similarly-employed workers will be paid to the foreign workers;
that no strike or lockout exists involving the occupation;
that notification has been provided to U.S. workers or their union; and
that the employment of H-1B nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the
working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed.
         By law, the Labor Department can do no more than review these
attestations for completeness and obvious inaccuracies 0* to determine
whether an employer checked all of the boxes, made no flagrant errors, and
signed the attestation 0* and must do so within 7 days of receipt.
         Because current law does not require any test for the availability
of qualified U.S. workers in the domestic labor market, many of the visas
under the current cap of 65,000 can be used by employers to hire foreign
workers for purposes other than meeting a skills shortage.    In addition,
current law allows a U.S. employer to layoff U.S. workers and replace
them with H-1B workers, and allows employers to retain H-1B workers for up
to 6 years to fill a presumably D&temporaryu8 need.    We simply do not
believe this is right.
         In 1993 the Administration asked the Congress to amend the H-1B
nonimmigrant program to address these structural problems. Unfortunately
for many U.S. businesses and workers, these amendments have not been
enacted.   The amendments requested in 1993 were carefully designed to
ensure continued business access to needed high-skill workers in the
international labor market while decreasing the H-1B programD,s
susceptibility to misuse to the detriment of U.S. workers and the
businesses that employ them.    Briefly stated, the amendments would require
employers which seek access to temporary foreign D&professionalD8 workers
to also attest that:
they have taken timely and significant steps to recruit and retain U.S.
workers in these occupations; and
they have not laid off or otherwise displaced U.S. workers in the
occupations for which they seek nonimmigrant workers in the periods.
immediately preceding and following their seeking such workers.
         In addition, the Administration urged enactment of another
amendment to reduce the allowable period of stay under the H-1B program
from six to three years to better reflect the D&temporaryD8 nature of the
presumed employment need.
         Enactment of these reforms will help employers actually facing
skills shortages, including those in the IT industry, obtain needed
workers through the H-1B program. Under existing law, employers facing
skills shortages must compet~ for available visas (up to the cap of
65,000) on a first-come, first-served basis with other employers that do
not face such shortages. Thus, enactment of the proposed amendments would
reduce pressure on the visa cap by screening out employers that are not
faced with skills shortages and have no interest in recruiting U.S.
workers.
         Some employers contend that adding these requirements will
substantially slow down the admission process for foreign temporary
workers and add many bureaucratic requirements to approval of their
application. This contention is simply untrue. The AdministrationD,s
proposed reforms would add two more boxes to be checked on the employerD,s
one-page application.   The Labor Department would still be subject to the
existing requirements that the application be processed within seven days
and only rejected where incomplete or where there are D&obvious
inaccuracies.D8 There would be no new procedures that could cause delays


in processing and approval. The employer would simply attest that it had
tested the u.s. labor market in attempting to fill the job(s) and that,
during certain times, it had not or would not layoff U.S. workers in the
same occupation.
        Many industry representatives assert that they search exhaustively
in the u.s. labor market to fill open jobs and that the tight IT labor
market does not allow layoff or displacement of U.S. workers.
Accordingly, attesting to these two common sense reforms should impose no
additional burden.
        Some employers contend that any attempt to monitor the
truthfulness of these attestations 0* after the application is approved
and the nonimmigrants admitted 0* would subject the employerC,s hiring and
termination decisions to D&second guessingD8 by the government.   Such
decisions are already subject to review in the context of enforcement of
employment discrimination laws, including the anti-discrimination
provisions of the immigration laws. Moreover, under existing law,
employersD, authority to import foreign workers is conditional and there
are few impediments to the exercise of this authority by employers before
the approval of the nonimmigrant admission.  Subjecting employersD, hiring
and termination decision-making to scrutiny after-the-fact is the least
burdensome way to ensure that the employers are not discriminating against
u.S. workers in favor of temporary foreign workers.
        If the AdministrationD,s reforms are not implemented and the two
new attestation elements are not added to the H-1B program, the Labor
Department will not be able to assure that the intended purposes of the
program are actually served. The H-1B program exists to assure that U.S.
employers can meet short-term labor needs by limited access the
international labor market. Under current law, as the Inspector General
has pointed out, the government is effectively powerless to assure that
employers use the H-1B program for its intended purpose, and that purpose
only.
Conclusion
        Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by restating that the growing
workforce needs of the IT industry can only be met 0* and the strength and
growth of the industry secured in the long run 0* if We take the steps
needed to fully develop and utilize the skills of U.S. workers.   Increased
reliance on temporary foreign workers should, at most, only be a small
part of the solution and must be viewed as a minor complement to the
development of the U.S. workforce.  Further, let me repeat that reform of
the H-1B program is essential to eliminating abuses under the program and
providing appropriate protections for U.S. workers.   Enactment of these
reforms would effectively allocate a greater share of H-1B visas to
employers facing actual skills shortages.
        I appreciate the interest shown by the Subcommittee and staff in
our views, and your thoughtful consideration of them.   The Department
looks forward to continuing to work closely and cooperatively with you and
your staff on these issues.
        Mr. Chairman, that concludes my prepared statement.   I would be
happy to respond to any questions.
