MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM BRUCE REED
          RAHM EMANUEL

RE           Options regarding "Sporterized" Assault Weapons Directive


       Attached is draft directive on the importation of a new class of modified,
or "sporterized", assault weapons. As you know, the 1994 Crime Bill bans 19
specific assault weapons, their duplicates and certain other semiautomatic
weapons with various military-style features. The 1968 Gun Control Act prohibits
the importation of firearms that are not "generally recognized as particularly
suitable or readily adaptable to sporting purposes." Despite these restrictions,
some otherwise prohibited weapons have been redesigned in order to
circumvent the ban and meet the sporting purposes test criteria for importation.

       Generally, the directive to the Treasury Department we are proposing
mirrors your action in 1993 to ban the importation of assault pistols and the
action taken by President Bush in 1989 to ban the importation of assault rifles.
Specifically, the directive would: (1) require Treasury to reexamine, and if
necessary, modify the criteria used to keep non-sporting weapons out of the
country; and (2) temporarily suspend the approval of any pending and future
applications for permits to import sporterized assault weapons. Although only a
limited number of these firearms has come into the country since passage of the
assault weapons ban (approximately 14,000 in 1994, 12,000 in 1995,30,000 in
1996, and nearly 20,000 to date this year -- as opposed to nearly 160,000 in 1993),
applications are now pending to impo~ as many as 1.1 million of these firearms.

      As you know, we have not yet resolved whether the Administration should
take the additional step of temporarily suspending permits that already have
been granted. While ATF originally estimated that 300,000 sporterized assault
weapons could be legally imported under roughly 50 existing permits, they now
put the figure at about 600,000. The difference is due largely to an erroneous
action taken last week by ATF staff to approve 3 permits for an additional
175,000 sporterized firearms -- despite Treasury's internal instructions to not act on
pending applications until the scope of this directive was determined.
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       We have worked with Treasury, Justice and White House Counsel to
develop the strongest possible case for suspending existing permits. For
instance, over the weekend, ATF re-reviewed gun tracing data -- a key factor in
upholding the Bush Administration's 1989 suspension of all permits (Gun South,
Inc. v. Brady) -- to determine the number of sporterized assault weapons being
recovered at crime scenes. And while ATF discovered that there was a 145%
increase in the number of sporterized weapons traced since 1994, this is due
mostlyIo the Administration's more than doubling of the number of crime guns
traced.

        Despite our efforts, Justice litigators continue to have serious doubts that
we have a sufficient factual basis for temporarily suspending existing permits.
They point out that, in upholding the Bush Administration's 1989 action, the court
relied on a combination of specific facts, including: (1) the dramatic
proliferation of assault rifles in criminal activity; (2) a 57% increase in the number
of assault rifles recovered at crime scenes; (3) several highly publicized shootings
involving assault rifles, such as the Stockton, CA murders; and (4) data indicating
the smuggling of assault weapons for use in foreign crimes. Arguably, these
circumstances do not exists today. Overall sales and imports of assault-type
rifles are down significantly from previous levels, and current gun tracing data is
skewed by the overall increase in the number of weapons traced. Only the
large number of approved and pending permits are comparable to the
circumstances in 1989.

       Although Justice litigators believe that this is a high risk case, they have
clearly stated that they will defend it. However, they -- and we -- remain
concerned that a loss on the temporary suspension of existing permits could
undermine our ability to defend any future action taken by Treasury to modify
the test for non-sporting weapons.      For instance, an unfriendly court could
decide to rule more broadly on the Administration's authority to interpret the
sporting purposes test under the 1968 Gun Act.

       You must decide among the following options to finalize the scope of the
directive:

      Option 1: Suspend action only on pending and future permits (about 1.1
      million firearms and growing). The 50 existing permits to import 600,000
      firearms could be exercised during the review period, but -- if the sporting
      purposes test is ultimately changed -- permits for firearms that no longer
      meet the sporting purposes test would be revoked. Treasury and Justice
      lawyers believe this option is entirely defensible. Senator Feinstein and
      other Members of Congress would complain that this action is not
      sufficiently bold.
Option 2: In addition to suspending action on peH8iR~trej1fmiJre
permits, temporarily suspend all existing permits (roughly 50 permits for
600,000 firearms) while the sporting purposes criteria is reviewed. After·
this review, if the sporting purposes test is changed, permits for firearms
that no longer meet the test would be revoked. Justice litigators believe
that this option presents a substantial litigation risk and could undermine
our ability to defend future action by Treasury to modify the sporting
purposes test. Additionally, key Treasury staff would spend much of the
review period in court - and not necessarily working on re-examining the
sporting purposes test.                                                   .

Option 3:     Immediately suspend action on the importation of pending
and future permits, and require Treasury to closely monitor the levels of
importation and criminal use of sporterized firearms during the review
period. Existing permits could be suspended if there is a significant
change in either of these categories, and if Treasury and Justice establish
that there is a sufficient factual basis to do so. Although this solution may
not be acceptable to Senator Feinstein, it is likely to lessen criticism from
others -- and reduce our litigation risk.

Option 4: In addition to suspending pending and future permits, also
suspend the 3permits for 175,000 firearms erroneously issued last week.
These 3 permits were mistakenly granted prior to finalizing our interagency
process on the directive -- during which time Treasury had informally
placed a moratorium on issuing permits. Treasury and Justice lawyers
believe there is at least some basis to defend this action. As with Option
# 1, Senator Feinstein and other gun control advocates may not find this
action to be sufficient.
