        BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

                               A PROCLAMATION


     Americans always have believed in the dignity of work.                  The

American Dream means that if we work hard and play by the rules,

we will be able to provide for our families and give our children

a head start on a better life and a brighter future.                 But for many

women in America,    that dream is not yet a reality.

     This year, National Equal Pay Day falls on April 3, the day

on which an average U.S. woman's 1998 earnings, when added to her

1997 wages, will finally equal the wages earned by an average U.S.

man in 1997 alone.     This means that, in general, women who work

full-time earn just 74 cents for each dollar that men earn.                   For

women of color, the wage gap is even wider -- African American women

earn only 65 cents for each dollar earned by men, and Hispanic women

earn only 55 cents.      While women now hold almost half of all

executive and managerial jobs, their wages are only 70 percent of

the average pay of their male counterparts.                 And, according to the

Department of Labor's Glass Ceiling Commission report, women

in management jobs generally remain at entry-level and

mid-level positions.       In part, these differences in treatment

exist because of differing levels of experience, education,

and skill.   But study after study shows that, even after legitimate

differences are accounted for, a significant gap still persists

between what men and women are paid, in comparable positions.

     Equal pay not only treats women fairly,                 it benefits us all

--particularly this Nation's families.                It empowers women to become

more self-sufficient, reducing the dependence of many families on

government assistance.        It also raises women's purchasing power,

increases their pensions, and improves their capacity to save, all

of which help to strengthen our economy.

        During the past three decades, our Nation has made a strong

commitment to ensuring that every American is treated with dignity

and equality in the workplace.          Such legislation as the Equal Pay

Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act have helped us to make

progress in correcting discriminatory practices, but we still have

a long way to go before the wage gap between men and women is

eliminated.     This year the President proposed in his Fiscal Year

1999 budget an additional $43 million for the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Labor in order

to strengthen enforcement of the laws that prohibit discrimination,

including wage discrimination; to encourage mediation; and to help

the EEOC reduce the average time it takes to resolve private-sector

complaints).     This additional funding will help all victims of

discrimination, including wage discrimination, obtain relief in

a more timely manner.     Over the years, the EEOC and the Department

of Labor have helped thousands of workers to fill better-paying

positions in industries from which they have been excluded in the

past.     The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor will continue

to make resources available through the Fair Pay Clearinghouse to

highlight model pay practices and educate employers about the

practical benefits of assuring equal pay for their employees.

        As we observe National Equal Pay Day, I urge businesses

and State and local governments across our Nation to make a solemn

commitment to recognize the value of women's contributions to the

workplace and to reward them appropriately.                   By doing so, we will

help to ensure that America fulfills its promise of opportunity,

equality, and justice for all.

        NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United

States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the

Constitution and laws of the United States of America, do hereby

proclaim April 3, 1998, as National Equal Pay Day.                   I call upon

Government officials, law enforcement agencies, business leaders,

educators, and the American people to

                                    Hex·Dump Conversion

recognize the full value of the skills and contributions of women

in the labor force.    I urge all employers to review their wage

practices and to ensure that all their employees, including women,

are paid fairly for their work.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this

                      day of                           , in the year of our Lord

nineteen hundred and ninety-eight, and of the Independence of the

United States of America the two hundred and twenty-second.
