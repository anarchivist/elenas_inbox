TEXT:
HHS is finalizing latest caseload numbers.   Last numbers we released with
the SOTU were for 9/97.   These are through 12/97.  I've seen a preliminary.
set of tables and the news continues to look good: Number of recipients is
down to 9.3 million, a decrease of 4.8 million or 34% from 1/93 and 2.9
million or 23% since 8/96. We should have final tables tomorrow.
There are several announcement possibilities that we'd like your feedback
on:
 (1) 4/9 VP event on federal hiring and reaching out to contractors.
 (2) 4/24 joint secretarial event on welfare to work housing vouchers and
transportation with DOT, HUD, DOL (probably), and HHS (Shalala can't be
there, maybe Kevin Thurm). VP's office is interested and checking
schedule.
 (3) 5/20ish Welfare to Work Partnership event.

HHS also wants to include the latest numbers in their TANF report to
Congress that was due April 1st, but is at least 1-2 weeks·away from being
finished (we've only seen a first draft).  We're assuming these should be
released by POTUS or VP first, before they are included in HHS report.
We're trying to nail down when HHS is likely to transmit report--some of
that depends on how long clearance over here takes and we expect to see
revised draft in about a week.

The 4/9 event is probably not the best forum and may confuse/divert focus
of that event. The 4/24 event would be good in terms of timing and
message, but question is who would release if VP doesn't attend.  It would
be great for POTUS to announce some caseload numbers at 5/20 event,
assuming we get it on the schedule. However, that may mean a long delay on
HHS report to Congress. Also, HHS thinks they could probably get more
updated numbers by then--states have them, it's just a matter of HHS
calling and compiling them. As a condition of not holding that long, we
could make them commit to get next set of numbers in time for 5/20.

How long do you want to hold, and are there other announcement options?
