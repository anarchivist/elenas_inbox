I got one not-great draft of an IDEA memo from OMB.   Barbara Chow just
sent me a note telling me her staff is going back to revise it, so I will
wait to forward you the next draft.

Subject:         IDEA

I just read Barry/David's memo quickly and asked them to expand heavily on
the IDEA regulation piece of this (e.g. what are the issues, how was
discipline handled etc.) The next memo will look quite different.
