     Subject: New Mexico TANF Reg. Counts HOD Assistance as Cash Income

     This issue came up earlier in the year when HOD wanted to include a
     statement in a letter to Congress saying that the Administration would
     seek a fix preventing States from lowering TANF benefits to individuals
     who also receive housing assistance (the lower TANF benefit means that
     TANF recipients pay a smaller amount of rent to the housing authority,
     lowering the housing authority's revenue).  The DPC objected to the HOD
     language and it was dropped. As described below, New Mexico seems to be
     going further than other States have proposed.   HOD may come back with
     options for a Secretarial statement and/or a statutory change, probably in
     pending housing legislation.   We'll keep an eye out for it.

Subject: New Mexico TANF Reg. Counts HUD Assistance as Cash Income

 Sen. Bingaman is asking Sec. Cuomo and Sec. Shalala to investigate a New
Mexico state TANF regulation, effective last week, that is causing
HUD-assi~ted households to be dropped from the TANF rolls.  HUD led a
conference call this afternoon, in which we participated, including its
field staff and the Senator's staff in New Mexico, to discuss options for
responding.

 The regulation counts HUD housing assistance as cash income. For a
family of three in Albuquerque, the average housing subsidy is $467, which
exceeds the $389 income cutoff for TANF eligibility; therefore, a family
receiving both forms of assistance must choose either to drop the housing
subsidy or become ineligible for TANF. A quick survey in the county that
includes Albuquerque by NAHRO found that 60 HUD-assisted families already
had dropped TANF upon income recertification by the PHA. Altogether, HUD
estimates 8,000 households in New Mexico have until now received both
welfare and housing subsidies; a high proportion are Hispanic.

 To date, HUD knows of a few other States that have included a limited
offset of housing assistance in their payment calculations for TANF; but
none has taken such an extreme action as New Mexico. From a State's
perspective, the large size of the housing payment and the horizontal
inequity'between those who receive such payments and TANF recipients who
receive no housing assistance is one motive for the offset. It also frees
TANF resources for other eligible uses.

 New Mexico participants suggested that there is still a possibility that
the State will modify its regulation in the face of editorial criticism
and objections from both Senators.

 Sec. Cuomo may be briefed later today on the issue. HUD staff will
present at least two options:  (1) having him make a public statement
saying that the New Mexico decision, even if not in violation with the
TANF statute, is in conflict with the intent of welfare reform and harmful
(with the intent of getting New Mexico to back off); and/or (2) seeking a
statutory change, probably via the pending public housing legislation.
Senator Bingaman's staff have asked HUD whether the Administration would
support a possible amendment to the public housing bill (which may be
taken up in the Senate after recess) that would address the problem.

 When HUD raised the issue of a possible legislative change to limit or
prohibit the practice of offsetting during clearance of the public housing
reform legislation a few months back, DPC staff objected and HUD dropped
the proposal.  I have advised Hal DeCe11 that, for either option, OMB,
HHS, DPC, and others will need an opportunity to review in advance.

 HUD field staff are meeting with Senator Bingaman this afternoon.
