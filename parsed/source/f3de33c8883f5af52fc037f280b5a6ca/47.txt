TEXT:
        As you know, Congressman Marty Meehan has requested that a White House
representative meet with him to discuss campaign finance reform legislation.
That meeting is scheduled for Thursday 2/1 at 1 pm in 318 CHOB.  I think the
three of us should attend the meeting but we should meet prior to the meeting,
perhaps at 12:15 pm in Susan's office, to discuss our message. Additionally, I
have sent a packet of materials regarding the status of CFR legislation and the
President's position to your attention.
        Please let me know if this is good for both of you.
