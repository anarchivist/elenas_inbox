ADVISORY BOARD ACTIVITIES

    American Council on Education Conference. Miami. FL. The Reverend
    Johnson Cook and Governor Winter spoke to 1500 college and university
    presidents, faculty members, administrators and students about the Initiative at
    the American Council on Education's "Educating One-Third of A Nation
    Conference". Governor Winter discussed the importance of diversity and
    inclusiveness in all aspects of higher education and the important role that
    colleges and universities playas models for society at large. The Reverend
    Johnson Cook discussed the importance of partnering with all communities in
    fostering positive interracial experiences on college and university campuses.
    She pointed out that the education community needs to recognize that other
    communities, such as the community of faith, already play an important role on
    college and university campuses and that all of these communities must work
    together if we are to achieve One America.

        While at the Conference, Dr. Franklin and Governor Winter also addressed a
        group of college and university presidents. They urged them to commit to
        becoming partners in promoting the goals of the Initiative, holding dialogues,
        providing information on promising practices and increasfng efforts to achieve
        more diversity on their campuses. The meeting was followed by a press
        conference. During the Conference, the ACE and the Association of American
        Colleges and Universities announced a year-long effort to encourage every
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion          .. ..




    college and university to conduct special programs focusing on race and other
    dimensions of diversity in American society.

    Carnegie Corporation Meeting. New York. NY. Governor Kean chaired a meeting
    of    researchers at the Carnegie Corporation. Much of the research they are
    undertaking will form the basis for a number of promising practices we will
    disseminate.

    Meeting with Hispanic and Asian American leaders. Linda Chavez-Thompson
    and Initiative staff met with leaders from the Hispanic and Asian American
    communities. The discussion focused on the progress of the Initiative.
    Additionally, these leaders have agreed to on-going dialogue about our activities
    and their involvement.

OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

    OUTREACH

    American Council on Education. Along with Reverend Johnson Cook and
    Governor Winter, I addressed the ACE's Conference on October 16. I was also
    the Keynote Speaker at the Opening Plenary Session and participated in the
    meeting with Dr. Franklin and Governor Winter and various college and
    university presidents. I discussed the goals, strategies, and challenges of the
    Initiative. Conference participants were asked to develop ideas for assisting the
    Initiative and to commit to implementing practical solutions·for solving issues
    surrounding race at their schools.

    Council of the Great City Schools. Detroit. MI. On October 17, Mike Wenger,
    Deputy Director for Outreach, participated in the Council of Great City Schools
    meeting which included a town hall meeting to discuss race and urban
    education. He elaborated on the goals of the Initiative and stressed the
    importance of our public schools in bridging our racial divisions. He encouraged
    the superintendents of public schools to become engaged in the Initiative and
    discussed ideas for how we can work as partners in carrying out Initiative
    activities and achieving Initiative goals.

    Carnegie Foundation Meeting. On October 15, I spoke to a group of
    approximately 35  people, inciLiding Advisory Board member Governor Kean,
    who have been provided funding from the Carnegie Corporation to implement
                                                     Hex·Dump ConversIon

studies and programs which        explore interracial and interethnic youth
relations. I briefed them about the goals and progress of the Initiative and
asked them to author papers based on their findings for use in our research.

Associated Press Managing Editors Association Conference. I was the keynote
        speakers at the ACME luncheon on Thursday. Approximately 275
members of the media were in attendance. I spoke at length about the role of
the media in not only the Initiative but also in fostering and promoting racial
harmony. I shared examples of newspapers from around the country that
published articles focusing on the state of race relations in their communities and
challenged those newspapers that have not yet developed articles on race
relations to do so. I also cited information from a survey which shows that many
newsrooms reflect the racial schism which plague          America and urged them
to find ways to close the divide within their own work environment.

U.S. Hispanic Leadership Conference. Chicago. IL. On October 11, I
participated on a panel on race relations in America. I spoke to approximately
700 current and future leaders from the Hispanic community. I shared key
demographic data about the nation's growing diversity and the implications of the
data for our country if we do not bridge our racial divide. I suggested specific
ways for the Hispanic community to take part in the Initiative and the dialogue on
race and encouraged them to reach out to other communities as well as in their
own communities where racial stereotypes and myths also reside.

PROMISING PRACTICES

Fairfax School District. In following up on your suggestion that we examine the
Fairfax School District as a possible model, we contacted the Department of
Education and obtained their commitment to assist in undertaking a case study
of the district as a laboratory for One America in the 21 st Century. The Census
Bureau also will be assisting us by compiling general demographic information
on the whole County of Fairfax. Linda Chavez Thompson has agreed to monitor
this project on behalf of the Advisory Board and to report on the findings.

Hope in Cities. At Chris Edley's suggestion, we met with a representative of the
Hope in Cities Program based in Richmond, Virginia. We discussed their
dialogue program and are researching whether it is a promising practice that the
Initiative should highlight.

RESEARCH AND POLICY PLANNING

Condensed Fact Book. We are continuing to meet with the heads of various
statistical agencies to develop a condensed fact book that would include
economic and social indicators and measures of success and will be broken

    down by race. We are in the process of determining which are the best
    indicators and measures to be included in the condensed fact book.

    COMMUNICATION

    On Wednesday, October 15 Linda Chavez-Thompson and Claire Gonzales met
    with staffers for members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC). The
    meeting was coordinated by Esther Aguilera, Executive Director of the CHC.
    During the meeting, Ms. Chavez-Thompson expressed her desire to develop a
    regular meeting time to ensure that the CHC voice was heard throughout the
    Initiative. Our division met with Kevin Moran to further discuss the PIR's web
    site. In coordination with Kevin, we developed a products list for the web site.

    Two articles were published this week on the Initiative: Oct. 12 by Stephen
    Holmes of The New York Times; and Sept. 29 "Indian Leaders Object to
    Exclusion," Indian Country Today. In the Oct. 9 edition, Mike Wenger was

WORK TEAMS

    Members of the Initiative and the White House staff have been working together
    in joint working groups. The teams met this week to refine further their
    workplans for the year and to develop a more specific timeline for initiating and
    completing activities. The following is a summary of their other activities for the
    week.

    YOUTH OUTREACH.

    This team will ensure that all activities have a youth outreach component. They
    will work to engage youths ages 13-25 in the Initiative and in working for racial
    reconciliation and racial justice.

    The Youth Outreach Taskforce has scheduled the first Federal Agency Youth
    Task Force meeting Monday,"October 20. It is in the process of preparing a
    draft of the President's "Call Young America To Action" letter which is due for
    review by October 20 .. They have also targeted November 14 as the date for a
    White House briefing for members of the media who specifically target Young
    America.

disseminate as many promising practices as possible through various channels
to spur dialogue and action. A short term goal is to disseminate through the
Internet promising efforts and initiatives in racial inclusion and reconciliation that
have been initiated or reinvigorated because of your Initiative. A long term
project is to publish a compendium or list of promising practices, and thereby
promote the use of these practices across the nation as part of the on-going
dialogue.

CABINET AFFAIRS.

The goal of this work team is to coordinate initiative activities with the Federal
agencies in five areas: outreach, policy, data collection, promising practices,
and management practices. The team will also encourage and track each
agency's efforts on the Initiative, and identify strategic opportunities for the
Cabinet and Sub-Cabinet to amplify the key messages of the Initiative.

COMMUNICATIONS/PRESS.

The Communications work team will work to ensure the Initiative's success by
coordinating media involvement and attention to the Initiative in all areas of
activity. They will monitor and enforce consistency of message and accuracy of
information. The content of communications products will be developed directly
from information generated by the other work teams. It will work to convey your
message to the American public on the progress of the Initiative and to provide
information that encourages a national dialogue on race by implementing
creative communication activities that attract the national media and use various
press tactics to reach members of the public who might not otherwise be
interested.

The team has developed a list of proposed short term, mid-term, and long term
products for the Initiative. It also developed a plan for modifying the web site to
better engage the public by making the site more interactive and dynamic.

POLICY.

This work team will develop and announce concrete policies and actions related
to the Initiative, focusing on education and economic opportunity, but also
including crime, health care, and civil rights enforcement.

    The goal of this work team is to recruit and nurture leaders who will sustain and
    expand the process of racial reconciliation begun by your Initiative.

     It set goals and time lines for developing a set of proposed criteria for
     designating leaders, a process for vetting potential leaders, and a list of activities
     in which to encourage leaders to engage.

     DIALOGUE IN COMMUNITIES.

    This work team will focus on planning and executing town hall meetings, advisory
    board meetings, and other events that will create national dialogues on race.
    The team will work with other teams, such as Cabinet Affairs, to coordinate
    strategies for dialogue by Cabinet and Sub-Cabinet level personnel.

    The team is planning the first Presidential Town Hall meeting. It is undertaking
    research on potential themes, sites, and participants. Also, the team is
    developing a set of proposed activities for the remainder of the Initiative year and
    establishing time lines for completing these activities.

    engage the Advisory Board more fully in Initiative activities.

     developing a schedule for the remaining meetings.

    TOUGH MESSAGES.

    This work team is identifying the tough issues and hard questions that you and
    the Advisory Board will raise and address and the messages that should result
    from raising those tough issues.

     LIVING REPORT.

    This work team is responsible for developing an outline and subsequent drafts of
    your report to the American people at the end of the Initiative year. This team
