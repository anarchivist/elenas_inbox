                            CHARTER SCHOOLS EVENT

                          DATE:                September 20, 1997
                          LOCATION:            San Carlos CharterLeaming Center
                          BRIEFING TIME:       10:00 am - 10:05 am
                          EVENT TIME:          10:30 am - 11:50 am
                          FROM:                Bruce Reed

I.    PURPOSE

      To demonstrate your commitment to charter schools and highlight the success
      charter schools are having throughout the state of California. This is an
      opportunity to reiterate your call to Congress to continue funding for charter
      schools and other education initiatives supported by you.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will participate in a round table discussion with charter school administrators,
      teachers, parents, and students from six charter schools in California. The event
      will take place on the fifth anniversary of the nation's second charter school law,
      which was signed by Governor Wilson on September 20, 1992 -- proposed by former
      California State Senator Gary Hart. The San Carlos Charter Learning Center was
      the first school in the state to receive a charter.
      In your opening remarks, you will be announcing $40 million in new and continuing
      grants for charter schools. California will be receiving $3,399,959. The grants will
      be used primarily for planning and start-up costs. They can also be used for
      curriculum development, teacher training, technology, assessment development and
      dissemination of best practices between charters and the rest of the public school
      system. Earlier this summer, $6 million in charter school grants were released
      because of the overwhelming demand for these funds.

      When you first took office there was only one charter school in the nation, and only
      two states had enacted charter school laws -- Minnesota and California. As a result
      of your leadership, there are now approximately 700 charter schools open this fall,
      and a total of 29 states and D.C. now have charter school laws.

      You signed into law the first federal charter schools program as part of the
                                                                 H~".OIlli1P Conversion


       reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1994. The
       program has grown from a $6 million in FY 1995 to $51 million in FY 1997. In
       your FY98 budget proposal, you requested $100 million to support the development
       of approximately 900-1000 charter schools.

       As you know, the Gorton Amendment, which recently passed the senate, would
       block grant the charter schools program and eliminate targeted support for charter
       schools. Today, Congressman Hoekstra pulled the. House version of the Gorton
       Amendment off the floor, and the issue will now need to be addressed in
       conference.

       The Gorton Amendment would also block grant education technology grants, such
       as those released last week by the Department of Education. The Department
       released $ in ed tech to... On September 21, 1995, you met with high tech industry
       CEOs in San Francisco and challenged them to help wire schools. Oracle CEO
       Larry Ellison, who will participate in this round table, attended this meeting and
       has since made a commitment to contribute $100 million to this cause. Just two
       days before your visit, Oracle will be holding an event in Los Angeles to announce
       the 100 poorest schools in Los Angeles that will be furnished with computers in
       every classroom by Oracle.
