TEXT:
NGA has contacted me to meet on the Indian gaming issue.   Per your suggestion, I
contacted Emily Bromberg and Marcia Hale.   I only heard back from Emily who said
she did not need to be in the meeting, but that I should check with you if the
meeting is permissible.
I informed the NGA contact that I would be unable to comment on their position,
but she could give me a short presentation.
please advise if this is allowable in light of the rulemaking.   Thank you! !
