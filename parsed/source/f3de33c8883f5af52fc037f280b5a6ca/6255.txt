TEXT:
Elena -- I understand that a letter is being drafted to state our position
on the pending Cloning legislation.   As you know, the bill may come up in
the Senate this week.  If the letter is a Presidential letter, we would
normally just send the letter to our SAP distribution.

Please advise on how you think we should proceed in terms of a SAP.

Thanks!
