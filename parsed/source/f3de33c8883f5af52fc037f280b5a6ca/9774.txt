TEXT:
Sandy (who's in Detroit to do a press conference with Mayor Archer) and I
would like to thank you for all of your hard work on the budget,
particularly for the stupendous AIDS funding, the work on needle exchange,
and trying to save Jeffords-Kennedy.  We know it was less than fun, but it
will do a whole lot of good.  David Beier made specific mention of how
much of an effort you put in on needle exchange, and we appreciate it.

Thank you!
