TEXT:
I will be in California beginning tomorrow through Monday afternoon.  I
have prepared some Q's and A's on the issue of the Prop 209 cert. petition
-- primarily addressing questions raised if we do not file.  Rob has them
on his system and can update them over the next few days pending further
developments and distribute them as needed.
