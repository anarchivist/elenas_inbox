TO:                Stephanie Streett
                   Director of Scheduling

FROM:              Marcia Hale
                   Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs

                   Bruce Reed
                   Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

                   Craig Smith
                   Assistant to the President for Political Affairs

                   Emily Bromberg
                   Special Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs

REQUEST:           For the President to meet with a bipartisan delegation of mayors to
            highlight the Administration's immigration budget package. On the day
            of the meeting, OMB will transmit our immigration bill to Congress.

PURPOSE:           To demonstrate bipartisan support for the Administration's
                   immigration budget bill; to respond to Mayor Giuliani, Mayor Rice,
                   and Mayor Rendell's request to discuss the effect of welfare reform
                   on legal immigrants.

PREVIOUS
PARTICIPATION: The President has met with mayors in large and small forums on
several              occasions. Most recently, the President met with a group of 12
mayors on            December 18, 1996 to discuss urban policy and addressed the
Winter               Meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors on January 17.

DATE:              As soon as possible; this event is most newsworthy if it occurs before
our                entire budget bill is transmitted to Congress.
