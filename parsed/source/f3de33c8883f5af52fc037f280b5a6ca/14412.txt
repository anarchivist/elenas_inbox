Jeremy's last day with the DPC is Friday, December 20 ... and in
January, he's off to travel the world!
We'd like to send him off with a farewell party at Guapos on
Thursday, December 19, 7:00pm! Come when you'd like -- we'll be
there for dinner and later into the evening.
I'll send out a reminder with specifics as the date nears.
Please RSVP to me when you know your plans .. Thank you.
Hope to see you there!
