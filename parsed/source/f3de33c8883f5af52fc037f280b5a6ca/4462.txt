TEXT:
Nicole and I wanted to let you know that Mrs. Clinton is eager to speak
with all of us on two issues -- adoption and child care -- and will likely
be asking for a meeting in the next day or so.

On adoption, she is committed to doing whatever she can to move quickly
our Administration review pf the Senate adoption bill and to urge Congress
to work to pass a bill this session. We imagine she hopes to enlist you
both in that effort. Nicole and I are being briefed by HHS and
Chafee/Rockefeller staff this afternoon and will report back.

On child care, she wants to talk through policy ideas, and hear what you
both are thinking on where to target energy and resources.  Included in
the binder and memo we forwarded last week is an overview of where we were
as of last week on policy development. She was generally supportive of the
direction that the memo spells out, but had some concens, including:

1. We need better, bigger thinking on how to address the great need for
school-age care;
2. We should consider calling for a bi-partisan process to develop child
care safety standards/model state regulations; and
3. We should address the issue of parent choice, i.e. choice to stay at
home and ways the federal government can in some instances support that
choice.
