TEXT:
I understand from Sylvia Mathew's office that you are responsible for the
policy components of the President's racial reconciliation initiative.
For your information, I am forwarding a notice for an interagency meeting
we are hosting at CEQ next week to discuss the metropolitan initiative of
the President's Council on Sustainable Development.  The purpose of the
initiative is to create partnerships among the federal government, cities,
and surrounding suburbs to address the economic, environmental, and social
challenges facing a metropolitan region.  Racial reconciliation is not now
an explicit goal of this project. However, because it involves
facilitating a dialogue between cities and suburbs, that focus could be
added if you would find it useful.

Please call me at 66550 if you'd like more information.

Background
(1) President Clinton issued an Executive Order in June 1993 establishing
the President's Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD).  Creating the
PCSD fulfilled a US pledge made by former President Bush at the Earth
Summit in Rio in 1992. President Clinton asked the PCSD to propose a
sustainable development strategy for the US.

(2) In March 1996, the President's Council on Sustainable Development
transmitted its proposed strategy to President Clinton in a report
entitled Sustainable America: A New Consensus for Prosperity, Opportunity,
and a Healthy Environment.

(3) The PCSD report included the following national goal:

"SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. Encourage people to work together to create
healthy communities where natural and historic resources are preserved,
jobs are available, sprawl is contained, neighborhoods are secure,
education is lifelong, transportation and health care are accessible, and
all citizens have opportunities to improve the quality of their lives."

(4) Upon receiving the Council's report in March 1996 , the President
asked the Council to continue its work by focusing upon recommendations
for implementing Sustainable America.
To follow through on its sustainable communities recommendations, the
Council created a Task Force on Innovative Local, State, and Regional
Approaches. The task force was co-chaired by Dr. James Baker,
Administrator of NOAA, and Scott Bernstein, President of the Center for
Neighborhood Technology in Chicago.

(5) After transmittal of the PCSD report to the President, Laura Tyson
(Chair of the National Economic Council) and Katie McGinty (Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality) chaired an Interagency Working Group on
Sustainable Development. NEC and CEQ asked federal agencies to review the
PCSD recommendations and action items and report on related programs and
activities. This process produced a 376 page inventory of ongoing federal
activities related to sustainable development.

(6) In January 1997, the Council transmitted a progress report on
implementation to President Clinton. The progress report reflects an
emerging consensus that the metropolitan region may be the best scale to


address sustainable communities issues in urban areas.   By adopting a
metropolitan approach, the federal·government 'can help to bring together
center cities with surrounding suburbs and rural areas to create regional
partnerships to clean up brownfields, reduce traffic congestion, move
people from welfare to work, prevent crime, preserve prime farmland, curb
urban sprawl, etc.

The task force co-chaired by Jim Baker and Scott Bernstein drafted
language in the progress report that included the following "Recommended
Next Steps" for the federal government to adopt a metropolitan approach to
building sustainable communities:

Step 1) Develop and adopt federal metropolitan-scale policy through an
Interagency Metropolitan Sustainable Development Working Group.

Action 1: Establish a pilot demonstration program to encourage
metropolitan cooperation and problem-solving. The federal government
should act as a catalyst and facilitator for selected metropolitan regions
to pursue metropolitan-scale problem-solving strategies by highlighting
ongoing initiatives and successful models, coordinating the federal
response, leveraging existing resources, using administrative flexibility,
streamlining service delivery, and directing resources to more effectively
support metropolitan sustainable development strategies.

Action 2: Identify and change existing federal programs or policies which
encourage or subsidize sprawl and urban disinvestment, reorienting them to
revitalize existing communities, whether urban, suburban, or small town.

Step 2) Similar to the efforts with respect to metropolitan regions,
convene a group to focus on implementing sustainable development in rural
communities and regions.

(7) In December 1996, Adele Simmons, President of the McArthur Foundation,
requested a White House meeting to discuss implementation of the PCSD's
metropolitan policy recommendations (above).  In addition to MS. Simmons,
that meeting included Katie McGinty, Laura Tyson, Joe Stiglitz, (Chair of
the Council of Economic Advisors), and representatives of three other
foundations (Surdna, Pew, and Casey). Due to a strong expression of
interest from the White House, representatives from the foundations agreed
to provide the Administration recommendations on how a metropolitan
initiative would be implemented.

(8) To create such recommendations, the McArthur Foundation contracted
with Scott Bernstein of the Center for Neighborhood Technology. He has
assembled a team to a) identify metropolitan areas in which cooperation is
occurring between cities and suburbs; b) identify federal policies and
authorities that could be used to facilitate such cooperation; c) draft an
ideal "scenario" of how such cooperation might occur, including defining
the federal role; d) test that "scenario" in about 12 metropolitan regions
with local leaders; and e) to submit to the Administration a proposal for
how a metropolitan policy might be implemented.  To date, regional
meetings have been held in Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, St. Louis,
and Chicago.

(9) The McArthur process has focused upon three major ways that the
federal government can participate in a metropolitan partnership:

a) Smart Citizens: How can federal information and technical assistance
programs provide tools for problem-solving to the citizens of a region?


b) Smart Money:  How can existing federal spending be invested wisely to
meet the unique needs of a region?

c) Smart Regulation:  How can federal regulation be crafted to meet
national goals in a manner that is cognizant of the unique circumstances
found in a region?

Detailed information concerning the McArthur process in general and these
three' areas of focus in particular can be found at www. cnt. org under
Metropolitan Initiative.

(10) In April 1997, the Administration renewed the charter for the PCSD
for another two years and asked the Council to address the following:

"Advise the President on policies and approaches that promote sustainable
communities.  In particular, the Council should promote
multi-jurisdictional and community cooperation in metropolitan and rural
areas.  The Council should create and participate in projects that help
forge partnerships among representatives of federal and state agencies,
urban centers, suburban areas, and rural communities with the goal of
solving, in a comprehensive way, local and regional sustainable
development issues.  The Council should use the partnership projects to
identify barriers to cooperation and innovative sustainable development
strategies that engage the constituencies represented by the Council."

(11) On April 29, the President's Council on Sustainable Development
(PCSD) held its first meeting of 1997. At that meeting, the Council
created four new task forces to address (1) global climate change; (2) a
new environmental management system; (3) international issues; and (4)
metropolitan and regional approaches to building sustainable communities.

The new task force on metropolitan and regional approaches will be
co-chaired by Susan Savage (Mayor of Tulsa), Scott Bernstein, and a
federal official who has yet to be identified.  It is expected that the
new task force will hold its first meeting in June or early July.
