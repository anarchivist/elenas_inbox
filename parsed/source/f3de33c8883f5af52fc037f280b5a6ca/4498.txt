TEXT:
Bingaman's press conference was at 2:00 today;  at that point we had 38
signatures, and were still trying to get Graham, Breaux, Kohl and Glenn.
Didn't do it in time.

The plan now: get it done by Monday, and have another press conference.
If asked today, Bingaman will say (1) we have strong bipartisan support
for tests in Senate; (2) we are firmly committed to the tests; (3) today
we are talking about another important topic.

Rahm is up to speed and ok with this.
