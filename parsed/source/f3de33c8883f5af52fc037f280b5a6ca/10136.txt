Drop in Juvenile Violent Crimes

                            WASHINGTON (AP)   -- Arrests of young people for
murder
                            and other violent crimes are down for the third
year in a row,
                            Attorney General Janet Reno said today.

                            In 1997 the juvenile arrest rate for murder
dropped 16 percent
                            from the previous year, and juvenile arrests for
violent crime fell
                            by 4 percent, Reno said at her weekly news conf
erence.

                            Comprehensive national juvenile crime statistics
will be released
                            this weekend.

                            Arrests of teen-agers for violent crimes plunged
9.2 percent in
                            1996, following a drop of 2.9 percent in 1995.

                            The declines follow a juvenile crime wave that
rose steadily from
                            1987 through 1994. The FBI reported a 169
percent increase in
,.

                     teen-agers' arrest rate for murder between 1984
and 1993,
                     when the juvenile murder rate peaked.

                     "Juvenile crime is not something that we have
to accept as a
                     way of life,"   Reno said today.

                     "We can bring these numbers down, and we are.
But there is
                     still much, much more that needs to be done.
While juvenile
                     crime is dropping, the problem has still not
been solved."

                     Reno praised the decision by Congress to provide
$95 million
                     for crime prevention activities for children at
risk. President
                     Clinton had asked for the money.
