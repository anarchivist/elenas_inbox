TEXT:
Chris and I need to have a longer conversation about this, but here are my
initial thoughts.  (I will write a little memo once I've heard back from
him.) We do not have a position on the Snowe-Reid bill, and I don't think
we should support it. Here are a few problems.

1.      We have been somewhat careful to avoid mandating insurance
companies to cover particular services. Why should we require them to
cover contraceptives but not eye glasses for children? I have some
concern about the President taking a stand on contraceptives.

2.      This bill does not reach many people because it does not cover
ERISA plans or Medicaid.

That said, it does fit with the President's message to make abortion
"safe, legal and rare".   We will give it more thought and get back to
you.
