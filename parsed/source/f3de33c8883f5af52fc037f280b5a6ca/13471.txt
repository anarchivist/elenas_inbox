TEXT:
When the "DeLay/Coats" type language on abortion-related
accreditation standards has been introduced as a free-standing
bill (a couple of bills that didn't move) a brief definitions
section has been included.  In these sections "health care entity"
has been defined as including "an individual physician, a
postgraduate physician training program, and a participant in a
program of training in the health professions".   This same
definition is included in the Senate-passed CR.   It's only the
DeLay amendment language in the House-passed CR which has dropped
the definition.
While the term "entity" may have been used here and there in
statute, it doesn't appear -- after our quick review -- to have a
broader standing.in Medicare, Medicaid, or public health law.
This is supported by the fact that other versions of the language
(such as the free-standing bills) felt the need to define it,
rather than citing a definition elsewhere in law.
