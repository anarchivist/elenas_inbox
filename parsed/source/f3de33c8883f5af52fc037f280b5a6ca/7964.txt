TEXT:
I just got a heads up from the Education Department and Kennedy's staff
that the Coverdell-Craig-Abraham Drug-Free Neighborhoods Act amendment to
the Tobacco bill may well contain a provision, offered last year by Senate
Republicans, that allows federal funds to be used to give vouchers to
kids who are victims of school violence, including drug-related crimes.

The overview/summary of the bill reads:  DRUG-FREE SCHOOLS: makes it an
allowbale use of federal funds to provide school choice or compensation
for k-12 students who are the victims of school violence, including
drug-related crimes .... n

In the education world, a tobacco bill that doesn't have class size
reduction but does provide for vouchers would be seen as a complete
disaster.  I don't know where things stand in the negotiations over this
amendment, but it would be great if we could indicate that this particular
provision would be a deal breaker.   Otherwise, the R's may be using this
to set the Dems up to take responsibility for bringing down the tobacco
bill.
