TEXT:
The following questions are not very important, just points of curiosity:

1. Licensing:   can we do anything to impose penalties on underage youths
who buy cigs?   Suspend drivers license? Take away fake ID?

2. Why did we back away last year from zero-tolerance tobacco policies at
schools?

3. For July 30, do we have a good list of ETS restrictions in various
states and cities?

4. Do bus lines allow smoking?

5. Koop Kessler envisions an executive order to promote global adoption of
US domestic tobacco control policies (see appendix 3, p. E5).  Is this
feasible? Does it mean anything?

6. KK also calls for strict penalties for tobacco smuggling.    (appendix
3, p. E7). Does that make sense?
