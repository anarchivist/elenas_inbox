The industry responded to the subpoena and turned over the documents to
Bliley.  I recommend that we applaud Bliley's effort, but say nothing or
remain critical about the industry's record on disclosure.

Tobacco Companies Turn Over Files to Congress

          In a major victory for anti-smoking forces, major u.S. tobacco
companies Friday turned over to
          Congress hundreds of potentially damaging documents they had
long fought to keep hidden, a
          congressional aide said.

          The documents were handed over after House Commerce Committee
Chairman Thomas Bliley, a
          virginia Republican, subpoenaed them, a Bliley aide told
Reuters. The companies had not complied
          with an earlier request to hand them over voluntarily.

          Bliley has said Congress needs to examine the documents to
verify whether they contained evidence
          of crime or fraud before considering legislation to settle
tobacco litigation. Bliley was not expected to
          make the documents public immediately, pending his own staff
review. Details on how he planned to
          proceed were not immediately available.

          If the papers do turn out to contain damaging revelations or
evidence of criminal activity, they could
          reverberate through congressional deliberations as well as
through the dozens of lawsuits pending
          against the industry. The proposed settlement reached by the
tobacco companies and state attorneys
          general suing them includes immunity from from certain future
lawsuits. But critics of the industry


          have demanded that the companies release a trove of confidential
documents before Congress
          grants any kind of immunity.
