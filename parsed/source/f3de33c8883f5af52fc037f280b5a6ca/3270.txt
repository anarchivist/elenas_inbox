MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SECRETARY OF THE
INTERIOR

Subject:       Law Enforcement in Indian Country

        I am proud of this Administration's progress in reducing violent crime and improving
public safety for our Nation's citizens. Our efforts are making an important difference.
Nationwide, the violent crime rate has dropped approximately 17 percent since 1992, and the
homicide rate has declined about 22 percent.

       Unfortunately, during the same time period life has become more violent for the 1.2
million Indian citizens who live on or near reservations. Homicide rates, for example, have
increased to levels that often surpass those in large American cities. Numbers alone, however,
cannot convey the tragic impact of such violence on Indian families and their communities.

         This and other information you have provided to me make clear that we need to refocus
on this growing problem. While some tribal governments have developed strong law
enforcement programs, many others have encountered significant difficulty in doing so. Many
Indian citizens receive police, investigative, and detention services that lag far behind even this
country's poorest jurisdictions. The Federal government has taken steps to address this problem.
 The Administration has sought increased Department of Interior funding and tribal control of
law enforcement programs on Indian lands. This year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
established an Office of Indian Country Investigations in its Violent Crimes Section, allocating
additional agents to Indian Country. The FBI also initiated a nationwide outreach training
program for Indian Country law enforcement officers. We have created additional tribal liaison
positions in the United States Attorney's Offices in Indian Country, intended to improve our
ability to bring offenders to justice. Through our Community Oriented Policing Services
Program, we have assisted tribal law enforcement agencies in hiring officers in Indian Country.

         Yet, law enforcement in Indian Country remains a serious problem. For these reasons,
consistent with the spirit of my 1994 memorandum on government-to-government relations and
tribal self-govemance, I hereby request the Attorney General and Secretary of the Interior to work
with tribal leaders to analyze law enforcement problems on Indian lands. By October 31, 1997,
the Departments of Justice and Interior should provide options for improving public safety and
criminal justice in Indian Country. To the extent that these options might affect the
Departments' budgets, they should be included in your 1999 budget submissions and should be
consistent with the funding targets of the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement.
