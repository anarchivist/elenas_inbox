TEXT:
 USDA believes it should have access to $146 million in unspent funds.
OMB disagrees.  I believe Glickman will send the President a note on this
issue.  Attached is a USDA background note explaing the issue in 3
paragraphs. USDA notes that if we can free up this money, it frees up
money for other important concerns like fod safety.  They would obviously
like us to note our agreement to OMB. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ==========

pressure on its fiscal year (FY) 1999 appropriations bill. Both the House and Senate versions of
USDA's appropriations bill underfund many of our most important initiatives. These include
items such as the Food Safety Initiative, Fund for Rural America, the research initiatives
authorized in the new legislation recently signed by the President, the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and our Integrated Pest
Management Initiatives for farmers. Further, since the President submitted the FY 1999 Budget
in February 1998, conditions in rural America have deteriorated; and we need to reconsider our
earlier proposals to reduce staffing in the Farm Service Agency.

        It would be very helpful ifthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would
reconsider its decisions concerning unobligated balances from previous rural development
programs which were transferred to and merged with the new Rural Community Advancement
Program (RCAP) and Rural Housing Assistance Grants Program (RHAG) by language in our
Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations Act. There are $146 million of such balances. Funds for
RCAP and RHAG are provided on the basis that they are available until expended. USDA's
budget office and General Counsel believe this $146 million is available and could be used to
alleviate some of the underfunding in the FY 99 appropriations bill. Senator Bumpers, ranking
Democrat on Senate Ag Appropriations, also believes these funds are available and has written
OMB in this regard. USDA wrote Jack Lew on June 17, 1998, asking for help on this issue.

        However, it appears that OMB staff believe that the transferred funds from previous
balances are no longer available. Obviously, if we had this $146 million to help finance our
rural development activities, this would have the affect of freeing up funds to pursue other
important Administration priorities.
