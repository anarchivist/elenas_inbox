Subject:         WEEKLY REPORTS

The Chief of Staff and his two Deputies have placed a greater interest in
reading the Weekly Reports produced by your offices.  You should know that
the President has also expressed to the COS office that he also finds the
weekly reports very helpful and important.

So that Erskine, Sylvia, and John can read the weekly reports before / or
at the same time as the POTUS, we would like to ask each office to try to
help us in the following ways:

1.      Please note "cc:  Erskine Bowles"     on your weekly reports, if
you do not already do so.

2.      Please drop off a copy of your weekly report to me at the same
time as you give it to Staff Secretary for the POTUS.   [I will
circulate to Erskine, Sylvia, and Podesta]

3.      Please have your weekly reports to the COS by Friday evening if
possible, Saturday      afternoon ( 3-ish) at the latest.


Caution: No one should get alarmed by this message.  These reports are
very helpful. We are just trying to make sure they are getting to the COS
in a consistent, timely manner.


THANKS.
