TEXT:
Attached is a summary of the Education Week issue on accountability.  In
light of the overwhelming volume of information in this issue and our
ongoing internal debate, I chose to focus this item on the issue of
holding schools accountable for results, in order to make the following
points (1) other views to the contrary notwithstanding, we do indeed have
a proposal to hold schools accountable for results (2) not many states are
doing all that we would require under our proposal--so our proposal would
have a big impact on education practice (3) those that are doing all we
propose have made significant gains in increasing achievement overall and
reducing the performance gap between minority and majority students.

Education - Accountability for Results. Education Week released its annual Quality Counts
report, which focused on state approaches to holding schools, educators and students accountable
for results. The report demonstrates clearly that while the accountability measures we plan to
include in our ESEA reauthorization proposal are beginning to take hold in the states, relatively
few states are yet using the full set of accountability measures needed to effectively link
consequences to performance. For example, our proposai would require states to issue school
report cards to the public, recognize high performing schools and identify and intervene
aggressively in failing schools. The report shows that 36 states issue report cards for each
school, though only 13 send the report cards to parents, and only 26 place them on the internet.
Only 19 states publically identify low performing schools and provide them with assistance. Of
these, only ten have the power to remove teachers or principals, and only seven permit students
in these schools to leave the school and enroll in a different public school. Sixteen states have
the power to take over, reconstitute or close down failing public schools--though Education
Week reports that only three states (New York, Oklahoma and Texas) have applied this
sanction, and then only to a total of 55 schools. Nineteen states reward successful schools, and
fourteen of these provide successful schools with additional money. And only five states have a
comprehensive system for holding schools accountable for results -- using school report cards,
ratings of schools, monetary rewards for success and ultimate sanctions for failing schools.
Significantly, two of these states - North Carolina and Texas - have been shown in other
studies to have made the greatest overall improvement in student achievement and the greatest
strides in closing the achievement gap between minority and majority students.
