PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON VIOLENCE AND
THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
May 14, 1999

        Good morning.  In the past few weeks, our nation has been united
in grief with the people of Littleton.  Today, I want to talk to you about
the ways we must unite in action to keep our children safe.

        Since that terrible day, people across America have searched their
souls and searched for solutions to prevent this kind of tragedy from
happening again. And last week, at our White House strategy session on
children and violence, representatives of every sector of society agreed
on one fundamental fact: making progress requires taking responsibility.

        That responsibility begins at home.  Parents have a duty to guide
children as they grow, staying engaged, staying involved in their lives.
The most important influence on a child is a parent.

        Here in Washington, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of
the hands of criminals and children.  There is a broad national consensus
on that point -- everywhere, it seems, except the U.S. Senate. Last week,
the Senate twice passed a phony proposal instead of a real law that would
close the deadly gun show loophole, through which tens of thousands of
guns are sold each year without background checks.  Even worse, the Senate
bill is riddled with new loopholes -- permitting convicted felons to get
guns at pawn shops, no questions asked; and making it harder, not easier,
for law enforcement to trace guns used in crimes.

           If the Senate says it wants to fix the problem, it should fix the
problem.
