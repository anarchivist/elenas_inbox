along with Stacy's summary of OLC's view.  So I guess the only question is
whether Elena wants to talk to Randy to hear it first-hand.

Subject:         OLC Verbal Opinion on Washington State

Given the info in the attached note, Ken no longer supports allowing
Washington administratively.  I guess a next steps discussion are in
order.  I'll plan on finishing the language this week.

Subject:         OLCVerbal Opinion on Washington State

OLC relayed the following opinion to me verbally, after I told them that
USDA would probably only want a written opinion if they said it was legal.

They would recommend against allowing the Washington State proposal. They
believe that while Section 15 of the Food Stamp Act does permit the
Secretary to issue coupons to anyone if it is in the "national interest",
that section was written explicitly for law enforcement purposes. The
Secretary does have the ultimate decision though as to what "national
interest" means.  In making that decision, OLC believes that the Secretary
would be compelled to consider what Congress intended under the welfare
law when it banned most legal immigrants from the food stamp program. sinc
e Congress spoke rather definitively on the subject, OLC believes there is
·

    a conflict between using Section 15 and the welfare law.

    In layman's terms, it is too much of a stretch.

    I told them that Elena might call back to clarify, but that I didn't think
    you would need a written opinion.

    I'm still working on the legislative proposal with USDA.
