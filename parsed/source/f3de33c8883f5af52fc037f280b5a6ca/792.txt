TEXT:
Agencies are asking me to pull together HHS, DOJ, SSA, etc. to formulate
strategy on how to keep pushing our legal immigrant package.  Presumably
we could also focus on food stamps.    I am assuming you would want me to
spend time on this, but if not let me know.  If I don't move aggressively,
I imagine Ken will.

FYI on one upcoming date:  On February 22, theoretically the first food
stamp recipients should be losing eligibility because of the new
requirement that you only get 3 months of benefits if you don't work.
