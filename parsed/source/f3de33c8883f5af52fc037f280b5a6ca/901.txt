TEXT:
Elena, attached is an agenda for tomorrow's meeting from 2-3pm in Room 211
of the interagency group on adoption.

We will have 3 things to hand out: copies of the "Adoption 2002" report,
the transcript from Friday's event, the directive, and the attached
agenda, which is just a numbnail sketch of the discussion.

My recommendation is for you to ask for a memo that outlines how the
agencies intend to respond the President's directive. We will have to
figure out in tomorrow's meeting which agencies will be responsible for
what pieces and how they will work together, as the directive asks the
agencies to work together to create the public awareness campaign.

FYI, the following people are coming to tomorrow's meeting:

Carol Williams, HHS
Melissa Skolfield, HHS
Stephanie Sworsky, Special projects, Labor
Cheryl Bruner, Director of Business Liaison, Commerce
Eldie Acheson, Assistant AG, Justice
Janice Lachance, Director of Communications, OPM (T)
Michael Thorton, Deputy Tax Legislative Counsel, Treasury (T)

Ann McGuire, Cabinet Affairs
