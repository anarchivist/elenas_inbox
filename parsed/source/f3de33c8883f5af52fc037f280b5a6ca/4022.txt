TEXT:
My favorite in the previous e-mail is #1. I would also make the
deductible tier abatable and the non-deductible tier non-abatable.   (Or
you could scrap abatement altogether.)

That's all I discussed with phil.  In addition, we should consider a
Presidential commission on youth smoking that would monitor the targets
and propose additional measures if necessary, such as excise tax penalties
if the targets aren't met (see scenario #4 -- or we could do
brand-by-brand excise taxes as Jerry suggested); plain-paper packaging;
complete ban on advertising; etc.

If there is an abatement procedure, I would say that any company with more
than X% of the youth market (10%? 20%?) would be ineligible for
abatements.
