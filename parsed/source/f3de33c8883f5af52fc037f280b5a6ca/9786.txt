TEXT:
I have received calls from them worried about the drafting of the
conscience language in the Lowey amendment.  I have consulted with Martha
Foley, who also spoke with them, and explained that this was policy/OMB
issue.  I know you are overwhelmed and I apologize for bugging you on
this, but it does seem to be a real concern to them.  Martha has explained
some of the politics to me, but I simply told them it was policy/OMB and I
would try to get you to call them.

The two issues, as you might have guessed, are:

language says religious plans not religious beliefs

and concerns that doctors don't always prescribe contraceptive devices -
IUDs etc. and they also give out pills in their office

The person is Richard Doerflinger
Office is 202-541-3171

As you know, I have dueling constituencies on this and therfore whatever
you do, I'll end up with unhappy people - perfect!
