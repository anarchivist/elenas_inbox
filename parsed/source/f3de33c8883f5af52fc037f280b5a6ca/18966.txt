TEXT:
Elena,
This morning, the WH group (including NEC, Peter and Maria) met with
Labor, Commerce, INS, etc. to discuss the policy and legislative strategy
re: H1Bs. Gene wants to bring this issue up at the NEC principals meeting
this evening (6pm).  Sally would like either you or Bruce to attend.

Ceci and I are putting together a memo that describes: context for this
issue; the Kennedy and Abraham bills; policy options (i.e., (1) do we want
a temporary increase in the cap, plus reforms and training OR do we want
no increase at all; (2) would we oppose an increase (temporary or
permanent) in the cap that does not include reforms and adequate training
); where we think the Hill is; and options for legislative strategy
 (including whether and how we should work with Kennedy). You will have
that in advance of the meeting. Thanks.

Julie
