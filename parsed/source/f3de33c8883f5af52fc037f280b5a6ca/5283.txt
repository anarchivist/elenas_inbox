TEXT:
You asked about ideas in three areas: parents at home, teacher
tenure/testing, flextime.

On parents at home the most plausible ideas we've found are the marriage
penalty, expanding FMLA, and we're looking at your idea of a labor
protection so you don't suffer career wise for staying with the child.

On Teachers-- Have we done anything with the NEA's position for peer
review? That seems the likeliest direction to take. We're looking at some
examples where it seems to have actually had some teeth, such as in Ohio.

Flextime-- We'll go back and look.
