Just one thing.   In thinking about it, I remember that the 50% job search
part was explicitly raised back in December.   I did a one pager for Ken,
Bruce and Gene Sperling which lists the 50%. At the time my understanding
from Ken was. that they both signed off.

I forgot about it until after I saw your note. Thanks for cc'ing me.
I'll make sure Ken understands the issues so he's prepared if Bruce calls,
etc.
