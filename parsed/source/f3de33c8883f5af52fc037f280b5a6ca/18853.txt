TEXT:
Received a call from Louis Freeburg from the SF Chronicle on bilingual ed,
saying he'd heard the White House staff including me personally had been
talking to people in califo about this issue--could I share some light on
what and why we are interested in this issue--I went on background
explaining that we've been talking to different people.   he said he'd
heard unz had been here talking to us--which I confirmed as part of our
strategy of talking to all people and all sides.   he asked if president
had ever taken position on bilingual ed which I said yes--he's in favor of
transitional bilingual ed programs and he has also spoken about the
importance in the global economy of people learning more than one
language.  looked at research shows effective programs when properly
implemented but those are few programs, cali right now is 20,000 teachers
short of qualified bilingual ed teachers, 30% of kids in califo are
getting nothing--what about those issues.   Pointed to the president's
education initiative target ted to drop outs, especially Hispanic--he
mentioned the Hispanic education initiative--that this administration has
been at forefront of improving education for all children--so he asked
when are we saying anything--I said we're still looking at the issue, the
re are other people to talk to but did point out that when the President
gets involved in an issue that sometimes escalates the matter and that's
something that needs to be evaluated. we'll see what comes out--just
thought you should know.
