     AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65 IMPROVED ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE
                               January 6, 1998

President Clinton today announced a targeted, paid-for proposal to give Americans under 65 new
options to obtain health care coverage. The President's proposal:



       Enables Americans Ages 62 to 65 To Buy into Medicare, by paying a full premium.

       Provides Vulnerable Displaced Workers over 55 Access to Medicare by offering those
I-
       who have involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care coverage a similar Medicare
       buy-in option.

t-
       Provides Americans Over 55 Whose Companies Reneged on Their Commitment to
       Provide Retiree Health Benefits A New Health Option, by extending "COBRA"
       continuation coverage until age 65.


Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure populations: they have less access
to and a greater risk of losing employer-based health insurance; and they are twice as likely to
have health problems. Some lose their employer-based health insurance when their spouse
(frequently the husband) becomes eligible for Medicare. Many lose their coverage because they
lose their jobs due to company downsizing or plant closings. Still others lose insurance when their
retiree health coverage is dropped unexpectedly.

These older Americans are often left to buy into the individual insurance market, which can be
prohibitively expensive (in some cases, more than 51,000 per month for a person with a
pre-existing condition) and altogether unavailable for many older Americans with health
problems. In virtually all states, people purchasing individual policies pay much higher insurance
rates because of a pre-existing condition; in many, they can be denied coverage altogether.

The President's targeted proposal provides greater access to health coverage by:

       ENABLING AMERICANS AGES 62 TO 65 TO BUY INTO MEDICARE, by paying a
       premium. The premium will be paid for in a two-part "payment plan." First, participants
       will pay a base premium of about $300 per month - the average cost of insuring Americans
       this age range. Second, participants will pay an additional monthly payment, estimated at
       $10 to $20, for each year that they buy into the Medicare program. This premium, to be
       paid once participants enter Medicare at age 65, covers the extra costs of sicker participants.
       This two part "payment plan" enables these older Americans to buy into Medicare at a more
       affordable premium, while ensuring that the buy-in option is self-financing in the long run.




                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
      MEDICARE by offering those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care
      coverage a similar Medicare buy-in option. Individuals choosing this option will pay the
      entire premium at the time they receive the benefit without any Medicare "loan," in order to
      ensure that Medicare does not pay excessive up-front costs and participants do not have to
      make large payments after they tum 65. This policy responds to the increased vulnerability
      of older Americans to work transitions and company layoffs. Such workers have a harder
      time finding new jobs: only 52 percent are reemployed compared to over 70 percent of
      younger workers. Nearly half of these unemployed, displaced workers who had health
      insurance remained uninsured.

      PROVIDING AMERICANS OVER 55 WHOSE COMPANIES RENEGED ON
      THEIR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS A NEW
      HEALTH OPTION, by extending "COBRA" continuation coverage until age 65. This
      proposal allows these retirees to buy into their former employers' health plan through age 65
      by extending the availability of COBRA coverage to these families. In recent years, the
      number of companies offering retiree benefits has declined: in 1993, only about half of
      full-time workers in medium to large firms had access to retiree health insurance, compared
      to 75 percent in 1985. Some companies have ended coverage only for future retirees, but
      others have dropped coverage for individuals who have already retired. This policy
      provides much needed access to affordable health care for these retirees and their dependents
      whose health care coverage is eliminated after they have retired. Retirees will pay a
      premium similar to that of other COBRA participants.

The President's proposal is fully funded and does not burden the Medicare Program.

      THE POLICY IS DESIGNED TO BE SELF-FINANCING. All three proposals are
      designed to be paid for by the people who benefit. People ages 62 to 64 who buy into
      Medicare will, over time, repay the amount that Medicare "loans" them when they are
      buying in. Displaced workers will pay a premium that takes into account participants'
      costs. And, the COBRA buy-in policy has no Federal budget impact whatsoever.

      ANY TEMPORARY COSTS WILL BE OFFSET BY MEDICARE FRAUD, ABUSE
      AND WASTE. The short-term Medicare "loan" to buy-in participants, plus the costs of the
      displaced workers' buy-in, will cost approximately $2 to 3 billion over 5 years. These costs
      will be financed by a series of new Medicare anti-fraud and waste proposals, which will be
      announced in the President's budget.
