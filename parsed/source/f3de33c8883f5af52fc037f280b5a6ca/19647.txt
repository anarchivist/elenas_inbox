TEXT:
Elena,
As you know from Peter's e-mail, we are expecting to receive a draft House
bill tonight. The mark-up is scheduled for Thursday. We are trying to
get in touch with Peter to decide whether we need a letter for the mark-up
-- however, we are not sure that we could get a letter that is directly
responsive to the legislation by Thursday (given the serious difficulties
that we would likely have with getting Commerce and Labor to agree on
language). We hope to know more in the a.m.

Julie
