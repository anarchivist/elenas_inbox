TEXT:
As you may know, the VP will be in Las Vegas tomorrow meeting with John
Sweeney and the executive council of the AFL-CIO.  Seems like it would be
important to put in a few paragraphs on the H1b issue into his briefing
book and to do a Q&A on this.  Cece Rouse offered to try an initial draft
and said she would send it to me, and I can send it to you for
reactions/edits.  I will also be on the trip tomorrow and can emphasize
any key points to the VP in his briefing.

Also, when you get the draft language on the Administration's statement of
principles, could you send it to me?Don asked if I could catch him and Ron
Klain up on this later today.

Finally, I spoke with Cece for a while after the mtg yesterday, and I am
wondering if we could be thinking bigger about a training package.   I ran
some ideas past her last night that I can explain in another note, but a
preliminary question is how much $ could be available for a package.   Do
you have any sense of this? It seems like this might be a great
opportunity to get support (from Congress and industry) for a substantial
training package, but I realize the budget cycle may be working against
us.
