    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:          Bruce Reed

    RE:            DPC Weekly Report



            1. Children's Health: We are finishing an HHS report that you will release at your May
    24 radio address on children's health. The report highlights the problems of uninsured children,
    demonstrates that there are many reasons that children do not have coverage, and describes how
    Medicaid and state programs have begun to meet the health needs of many of these children.
    The report shows that health and development can suffer if children are uninsured. It also
    demonstrates that there are many reasons for the large number of uninsured children in this
    country: some are the children of parents whose employers do not offer insurance or who lose it
    when they leave or change jobs; many have parents who simply can not afford insurance; and
    others are eligible for state or federal programs but are not enrolled in them. The report
    concludes that we can build on the success on Medicaid and state programs to expand health
    insurance coverage to millions more children.


           2. GAO Report on Welfare Benefit Terminations: A newly released GAO study
    requested by Sen. Moynihan examines waivers that allow 33 states to sanction AFDC
    beneficiaries by terminating their benefits.

             GAO found that 14 of the 33 states did not terminate any benefits in recent years, while
    another 7 terminated fewer than 100 cases. The report studied in depth the three states with the
    most terminations: Iowa, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, which had 13,000 of the 18,000
    terminations nationwide. All three have had above-average caseload reductions (Iowa down
    23% since 1993; Massachusetts 37%, and Wisconsin 49%). Even those three states terminated
    less than one percent of their caseload. However, states reported their belief that the policy itself
    encourages people to move toward work or discourages them from applying for benefits in the
    first place.

            One-third of those losing benefits later regained them after agreeing to comply with state
    requirements. Of those that lost AFDC, 75% had other federal support (food stamps, SSI,
    housing, Medicaid); and approximately 45% reported income from wages, pensions, or child
    support. Although waivers permit those losing AFDC to keep food stamps and Medicaid, the
    actual receipts of these benefits fell significantly, from 23% to 70%, presumably at least in part
    because families did not take the necessary steps to keep these benefits after losing AFDC.

                                                             ~"tnn'!~ted Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

        Cases were terminated because of failure to comply with enrollment or work requirements.
        Time limits were not an important factor in this study because they had not been in effect long
        enough. States reported that beneficiaries did not comply because they were "not feeling well;"
        were caring for a sick household member; wanted to stay home with their children; wanted to
        follow their own career plans, including higher education; or were unwilling to do community
        service or work for low wages.

                3. Welfare: On Monday, the Texas State Senate is expected to consider an amendment
        reported out of Committee May 14th and supported by Gov. Bush which would expressly
        authorize the privatization of computer systems and would allow further privatization pending
        federal approval. Democrats are expected to offer a substitute which would limit privatization
        to computer systems and technical assistance for an intergrated enrollment system --- similar to
        the House amendment which passed the first week of May. The legislature is scheduled to go
        out of session June 2.

                                                                           Hex·Dump Conversion
