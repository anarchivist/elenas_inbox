     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:          BRUCE REED
                    GENE SPERLING

     SUBJECT:       Race and Health Initiative

     Overview

             As a major component of your race initiative, we have developed a proposal that would
     commit the nation to an ambitious goal of seeking to eliminate racial disparities in health care by
     the year 2010. There are severe disparities in a number of critical health areas for
     African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. In some cases these
     minority groups suffer from diseases as much as five times as often as whites. To effectively
     reduce these disparities will require a Department-wide effort to find innovative approaches and
     apply them nationally across all health programs. The FY 1999 budget could take a
     two-pronged approach to this issue: (1) expanding our most effective public health programs and
     directing them to focus specifically on the problem of eliminating these disparities; and (2)
     funding competitive grants to thirty communities and monitoring them closely to improve our
     knowledge on how to close these gaps. New strategies learned through these grants would then
     be applied at a national level.

     Racial Disparities in Health Care

             The initiative would focus on the most severe racial disparities in the following health
     areas: infant mortality, cancer, heart disease and stroke, AIDS, immunizations, and diabetes.
     Some ofthese disparities are quite startling. For example, infant mortality rates are
     2 Y2 higher for African-Americans and Ilh times higher for American Indians and many Hispanic
     groups. For cancer, Vietnamese women suffer from cervical cancer at nearly five times the rate
     of whites, while Latinos have two to three times the rate of stomach cancer. African-Americans
     have a 35 percent higher cancer death rate. For example, African-American men under the age
     of 65 get diseases such as prostate cancer and heart disease at nearly twice the rate of whites,
     while Native Americans suffer from diabetes at nearly three times the average rate, while
     African-Americans suffer 70 percent higher rates. Racial and ethnic minorities account for
     25 percent of the population yet make up 54 percent of all AIDS cases. The demographic changes
     that are anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of addressing some of these
     disparities. As these minority populations with poorer health status are expected to grow, we
     have an opportunity to dramatically improve the future of the nation's health if we can find
     effective ways to close these gaps.


                                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
        Validation

               Proposing the ambitious goal of reducing these dramatic health disparities would receive
        overwhelming support from the public health community, by groups such as the American Public
        Health Association, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society as well as
        from minority groups such as the Intercultural Cancer Council, the American Indian Healthcare
        Association, the National Hispanic Council on Aging, the National Council of Black Churches.

        Proposal

                 HHS is proposing to spend $200 million in FY 1999 for this initiative, while OMB is
        currently recommending $30 million. We believe that we can develop a strong initiative with
        $100 million in your FY 1999 budget. This funding would be supplemented by a few other
        initiatives, such as the proposed increases in AIDS funding, some of which will be targeted
        specifically to minorities.

        ·      Improving Effective Public Health Approaches to These Problems. We recommend
               that you propose $70 million to apply some of our most effective public health
               approaches directly to reduCing these disparities. These public health programs have
               strategies that have proven effective as well as longstanding relationships with the
               minority health community and other community organizations committed to addressing
               these problems. Partnering with these organizations, these programs would build on
               their existing new knowledge and proven public health strategies to focus on how to
               eliminate these disparities.

        ·      Thirty Community Grants to Develop New Strategies to Eliminate Disparities. To
               eliminate racial disparities in health care will require developing new approaches to
               reducing these disparities, as we currently do not have the answers as to how to solve
               many of these problems. We recommend you propose $30 million to target thirty
               communities that develop innovative and effective ways to address these disparities.
               Each community, chosen through a competitive grant process, would develop
               intensely-focused efforts to address one of the six health areas. HHS would develop a
               working group that includes outside minority health experts to assist and monitor these
               communities and apply approaches across all health programs. They would also hold
               periodic meetings and conferences to educate the public health and minority community
               about new effective strategies to reduce these disparities.

        ·      Begining Today to Reduce Disparities. To ensure that we begin this initiative
               immediately, we are identifying ways in which the FY 1998 increases in these areas can
               be used to begin to address racial disparities. For example, AIDS education and training
               centers are beginning a new partnership with the Indian Health Service to develop new
               approaches to educate health providers about training and prevention. Also, the National
               Cancer Institute will expand efforts to help recruit more Hispanics into clinical trials.
