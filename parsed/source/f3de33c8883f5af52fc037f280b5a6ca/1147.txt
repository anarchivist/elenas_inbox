TEXT:
Here are the range of issues that we have played some role in over the
last four years:


Aging/Seniors
Veterans
Telecommunications
Transportation    (No one is working on High Speed Rail, and the first line
will open up from                Boston to Washington in 1999)
Children and Families
Infrastructure
Indians
Gaming
Agriculture
Corporate Responsibility
Defense Conversion
Disabilities
Housing (I assume Jose will handle, but Jonathan knows Cuomo well.)
Small Business
Space/NASA
Science & Technology

I think the most interesting of these are Small Business, Transportation,
Telecom, Space/science, infrastructure, and corporate responsibility. We
also desperately need someone to work on aging and veterans issues. Aging
can be interesting if you include entitlement reform, which is a huge
issue, and one in which we should be active.

I definitely am interested in handling environmental issues and would like
to keep that as well as political reform.    However, I am obviously
flexible.  One other issue we could give Jonathan is our Liaison to NPR
and the REGO effort.  I have to admit I haven't done much on that this
year and would be willing to give that up if Jonathan is interested.

Let me know what you both think.
