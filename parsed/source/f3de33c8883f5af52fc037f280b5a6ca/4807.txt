                                                                                               (Hou


          H.R. 2570 - Forced Abortion Condemnation Act
          (Fowler (R) Florida and 12 cosponsors)

          The Administration agrees with the proponents of H.R. 2570 that the
          practice of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization is abhorrent.
          The Administration, however, strongly opposes H.R. 2570 on several
          grounds.

          The Administration opposes the bill because it would:

          o       Contradict U.S. policy to expand dialogue with the Chinese in
          order to advance critical U.S. security, political, economic, and human
          rights interests.

          o       Possibly prompt China to impose its own visa restriction that
          could further limit the ability of U.S. officials to advocate views in
          China.

          o          Raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent that it would
~.




       inhibit the PresidentD,s ability to conduct the foreign relations of the
       united States and to receive foreign government officials.

       o       Fail to take account of u.S. international obligations to admit
       certain foreigners to the United Nations and other international
       organizations.

       o       Require the State Department to divert scarce resources from core
       tasks to comply with the requirement to maintain lists of officials
       covered by the bill.

       u.S. interests are best served by increasing the transparency of Chinese
       society and promoting expansion of ChinaD,s participation in international
       fora governed by standards and rules agreed to by the international
       community of nations. u.S. engagement exposes Chinese officials
       first-hand to the benefits of an open and democratic system. There is no
       better way to demonstrate the advantages of a free and open society than
       to let them experience it for themselves.

       In addition, the Administration is concerned that this and other China
       legislation being considered in the House would undermine the
       Administration's efforts to address these issues on the eve of the late
       October summit meeting. This summit will provide an opportunity to work
       for concrete progress on issues of concern to the United States.
       Consideration of H.R. 2570 and related legislation only makes that task
       more difficult.
