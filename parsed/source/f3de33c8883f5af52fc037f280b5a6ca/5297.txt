                              WELFARE TO WORK EVENT

                            DATE:                  November 17,1997
                            LOCATION:              Cessna Aircraft Company, Wichita, KS
                            EVENT TIME:            Tour 1:00 pm -1:25 pm
                                                   Event 1 :25 pm - 2:25 pm
                            FROM:                  Bruce Reed/Cynthia Rice


I.    PURPOSE

      To highlight the success of the Welfare to Work Partnership in increasing the number of
      businesses committed to hiring welfare recipients; announce new caseload reduction
      numbers; unveil new welfare regulations; and applaud the model welfare-to-work
      program at the Cessna Aircraft Company -- one of the founding members of the Welfare
      to Work Partnership.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will make remarks to an audience of 400, including elected officials and the 200
      Cessna employees who graduated from the company's welfare-to-work training program.
      The event will take place at the new state-of-the-art welfare-to-work training facility,
      called the 21st Street Learning Center, which will be officially dedicated at this event.
      The facility, which opened last month, will enable Cessna to double the size of its
      welfare-to- work program. Cessna will now train about 40 sheet metal assemblers and a
      dozen clerical workers at a time and provide on-site child care for the trainees' children.
      Cessna's sheet metal assembly program provides trainees a $6.50 an hour salary with
      health benefits, child care, and a guaranteed job upon completion of the program. The
      clerical skills training program does not pay trainees or guarantee them jobs, but provides
      free training and places graduates at companies throughout Wichita. The new facility
      was built by the city of Wichita using loan guarantees from HUD, and is part of a new
      Cessna campus which includes temporary housing for trainees (now under renovation)
      and a new subassembly plant.

      You will announce that in six months over 2,500 companies from all 50 states have
      joined the Welfare to Work Partnership and pledged to hire new workers from the
      welfare rolls - far exceeding the goal of 1,000 set at the May 20th launch of the
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


Welfare to Work Partnership. You will also praise the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's new campaign to enlist every local chamber of commerce in persuading
their members to join the Welfare to. Work Partnership and hire welfare recipients.

You will also announce that welfare caseloads have continued their dramatic decline,
falling another 236,000 in the most recent month for which statistics are available and a
full 1.9 million in the 11 months after you signed welfare reform into law. According to
the new numbers, 10,258,000 people were on welfare in July, a 27 percent drop from the
14,115,000 on the rolls when you took office. Since January 1993, a total of 49 out of
50 states have lowered their welfare rolls -- 16 states by 40 percent or more.

Finally, you will announce new work-focused welfare reform rules that will provide
state and local governments with the flexibility to use federal resources effectively,
while holding them accountable for results. These regulations make clear that we
want all welfare recipients who can work to go to work and that we want states to work
with every family on welfare to help them achieve self-sufficiency.

While the new welfare regulations will not be the focus of your visit to Wichita, we
arranged to unveil them on the same day as your visit to reinforce your commitment to
work and welfare reform. There are two sets of new rules: proposed regulations from
HHS to states operating the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) welfare
reform program and interim final regulations from the Department of Labor to states and
localities receiving grants from the $3 billion Welfare to Work (WtW) fund you fought
for and won in the Balanced Budget.

We were able to resolve all the issues with HHS in a way that we believe reinforces the
importance of the law's work requirements while giving states flexibility to design
programs and a fair opportunity to correct failures.

States that fail the work rates will be levied a penalty based on performance -- how far
they were from meeting the rates. States will have the opportunity to correct or
eliminate violations through a corrective compliance plan, and states that make substantial
progress during their corrective compliance period will be eligible for a reduced or
eliminated penalty. To protect states from an unreasonable risk, the penalty for failing to
meet the two-parent participation rate will be proportional to the size of the caseload in
the state.

The rule attempts to create a system of disincentives that will discourage states fr~m
trying to game the work requirements by steering hard-to-employ individuals to state
maintenance-of-effort programs, where the work rates don't apply. lfthe Secretary finds
that a state has diverted recipients into a state program to evade the full force of the work
requirements, she will refuse to reduce or limit the size of any penalties levied for failing
to meet the work rates or time limits.
                                                                         -Iex-Dump Conversion
                                                                       J
       The regulation, like the law, allows states to reduce the require work participation rate
       by the percent the caseload has declined since 1995, so long as the lower caseloads are
       not due to new eligibility restrictions. HHS initially proposed that states should not get a
       caseload reduction credit for enforcement measures like fingerprinting, but ultimately
       agreed to change this position.

       We were able to agree on a proposal to incorporate some of Senator Murray's concerns
       about victims of domestic violence. Under the new proposed rules, a state will not be
       penalized for failing to meet work requirements or time limits if its failure to do so is
       attributable to waiving these requirements for victims of domestic violence -- provided
       that these waivers are temporary and accompanied by services to help the individual
       prepare for work and self-sufficiency.

       The Department of Labor rules for the $3 billion welfare to work grants will ensure that
       grant recipients have the tools they need to move hard-to-employ, long-term welfare
       recipients to work. The rules provide great flexibility to state and local governments to
       decide what programs and services will best help these families become self-sufficient.
       They encourage collaboration among local agencies to ensure that child care, substance
       abuse treatment, and transportation needs are addressed. And they ensure that these
       funds are targeted to hard-to-employ welfare recipients -- generally those with poor
       education, low skills, and little job experience -- who need help the most and whom the
       program was designed to serve.

         These Department of Labor rules apply to both the funds that will be awarded
       . competitively (about 25 percent of the total) and those distributed according to the
         statutory formula. As you know, 85 percent of the formula funds will be distributed to
         Private Industry Councils, and 15 percent will be retained by the states. Both states and
         PICs may contract with other service providers. We plan to release an application for the
         competitive funds next month.
