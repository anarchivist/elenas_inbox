    Q:   WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO TODA Y'S NEW YORK TIMES STORY THAT
         STATES THAT SENATOR BREAUX IS ASKING THE CONGRESS TO WAIT
         FOR THE MEDICARE COMMISSION BEFORE CONSIDERING THE
         PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO OFFER MEDICARE FOR AMERICANS AGES
         SS TO 6S?

    A:   We do not believe that this story fully reflects Senator Breaux's views on this issue.
         Senator Breaux has accurately stated that the Medicare Commission has been charged to
         look at this issue as well as a wide range of other issues in its evaluation of the challenges
         and possible solutions to strengthen the Medicare program. Having said this, Senator
         Breaux is not saying that he would explicitly oppose legislation in this area if the Senate
         Finance Committee and the Congress achieved consensus that we should move forward
         to pass legislation on this issue this year.

         The President's believes that this is a financially responsible and targeted policy
         that addresses a vulnerable population that the private insurance market has failed
         to serve. Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure populations: they
         have less access to and a greater risk ofiosing employer-based health insurance; and they
         are twice as likely to have health problems. The policies proposed by the President are
         paid for and responsible, and will help people with few affordable choices for health
         insurance.

         While the work of the Medicare Commission will be extremely important, the
         President does not believe that the American public would sanction us putting on
         hold a targeted but important proposal that would help hundreds of thousands of
         Americans access health insurance. The President is confident that as Congress
         examines the needs of this population and the proposals to address it, the necessary
         consensus to move this legislation forward will be achieved.



    Q:   ISN'T THIS EXACTLY THE WRONG TIME TO PROPOSE EXPANDING
         MEDICARE -- RIGHT WHEN THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO MAKE
         RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL FINANCING OF THE
         PROGRAM?

    A:   The President has a targeted proposal that is paid for within the Medicare program and
         therefore does not add any new burdens to the program. We believe this is a worthy goal
         that is not inconsistent with the charge of the Medicare Commission. The Medicare
         Commission will be working to develop proposals for the overall financing of
         Medicare. The President's proposed policy will not conflict with the Commission's
         work in this area.
