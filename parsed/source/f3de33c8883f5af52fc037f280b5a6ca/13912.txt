TEXT:
Yesterday,
You faxed me a question on LRM #5274, Request for Views on S
1711 -- Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1996.   Your
question was:  "Any DOJ Appointment Clause concerns?"
DOJ has not responded yet to this LRM; however, when they do, I
will let you know if DOJ has any of these concerns.
