Moynihan examines waivers that allow 33 states to sanction AFDC beneficiaries by t~rminating
their benefits.

GAO found that 14 of the 33 states did not terminate any benefits in recent years, while another 7
terminated fewer than 100 cases. The report studied in depth the three states with the most
terminations: Iowa, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin, which had 13,000 of the 18,000 terminations
nationwide. All three have had above-average caseload reductions (Iowa down 23 % since 1993;
Massachusetts 37%, and Wisconsin 49%). Even those three states terminated less than one
percent of their caseload. However, states reported their belief that the policy itself encourages
people to move toward work or discourages them from applying for benefits in the first place.

One-third of those losing benefits later regained them after agreeing to comply with state
requirements. Of those that lost AFDC, 75% had other federal support (food stamps, SSI,
housing, Medicaid); and approximately 45% reported income from wages, pensions, or child
support. Although waivers permit those losing AFDC to keep food stamps and Medicaid, the
actual receipts of these benefits fell significantly, from 23% to 70%, presumably at least in part
because families did not take the necessary steps to keep these benefits after losing AFDC.

Cases were terminated because of failure to comply with enrollment or work requirements.
Time limits were not an important factor in this study because they had not been in effect long
enough. States reported that beneficiaries did not comply because they were "not feeling well;"
were caring for a sick household member; wanted to stay home with their children; wanted to
follow their own career plans, including higher education; or were unwilling to do community
service or work for low wages.
