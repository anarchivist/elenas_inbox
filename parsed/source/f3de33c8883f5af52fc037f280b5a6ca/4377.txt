TEXT:
At this morning's senior staff meeting, Mickey asked Podesta and Erskine
to call an FLSA meeting today or tomorrow. Apparently, Mickey told them
that we don't have a position or a message.  I tried explaining to him
that the agencies were looking at the Shaw proposal, that the issues were
complicated, and that we were meeting at a staff level to work on the
issues.  I also attempted to explain the strategy options, and that the
Shaw proposal may just explode.  I was not successful.  Sorry.
