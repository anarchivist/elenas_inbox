TEXT:
         Regarding Chris's book, he and I have met a few times, along with
staff from PIR, DOJ and ED. We have tried to narrow the list of topics,
but it was still rather long at last count. Just in our area -- civil
rights enforcement -- there are a host of fairly major policy issues that
could require significant discussion to resolve. So, it will take some
effort to develop positions in a thoughtful way.
        On another matter, I am proceeding with the memo on major
enforcement issues, which we discussed earlier. One of those is higher
education admissions, and I am assuming that our memo or Chris's book or
some combination may provide a way to resolve the issues that were left
open after our meeting on the Univ. of California investigation -- e.g.,
enforcement versus public persuasion. Your suggestions are welcome.
