TEXT:
We're going to set up reconciliation discussions with the agencies on the
same schedule as last week -- a conference call Wednesday at 8:30 am
(we'll send out the number later) and a meeting in 248 at 3 pm on Friday,
the 20th.

PAD offices are responsible for informing their agencies about both
conversations.

For the conference call -- we are still confined to too few phone lines,
so please consolidate incoming calls (2nd floor folks should meet in
Jack's office, DADs in PADs offices, etc.).  Please do not call in on a
cell phone (and PAD offices please tell you agencies not use cell phones
-- they generate too much noise) .

Thanks.
