FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      OCTOBER 24, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Today Senators Byrd and Moynihan introduced a bill S. 1319 to repeal the
Line Item Veto Act.

CONGRESS TODAY (10/24)

SENATE
Failed (43-49) to invoke cloture on the modified committee amendment to S.
1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997.
(Cloture was also defeated twice on Thursday.)   Senator Lott today filed
another cloture motion on the modified committee amendment. This fourth
cloture vote will occur on Tuesday. Lott has indicated this will be the
last cloture attempt on ISTEA.
         [SAP sent, 10/8: Administration supports Senate passage, but has a
        number of concerns, including making the bill fully consistent
with    the Bipartisan Budget Agreement.]

Passed (UC) H.R. 2013 - Designating the David B. Champagne Post Office
Building, clearing the measure for the President

HOUSE
Adopted (233-171) H.R. 2107 - Interior Appropriations Conference Report
(Adopted the Rule by a vote of 247-166)
[Letter sent 9/30: Senior advisers veto recommendation based on House
failure to fund NEA and to provide $700 million in land acquisition funds

Amtrak Reform and Privatization Act of 1997 (Open Rule)
        [House Rules SAP sent 10/21: Administration strongly opposes]
While under consideration of H.R. 2247, the House took the following
action:
o       LaTourette proposed an amendment to replace ShusterD,s labor
reforms with a proposal similar to the AdministrationD,s.  Representative
Quinn offered a perfecting amendment that would have effectively wiped out
the LaTourette amendment. The Quinn perfecting amendment was rejected by
a vote of 198-223. subsequently, Chairman Shuster pulled the bill from


the floor to avoid votes on the underlying Latourette amendment (a vote
for labor and against Shuster) and final passage.

Rejected (168-244) Motion to Adjourn
