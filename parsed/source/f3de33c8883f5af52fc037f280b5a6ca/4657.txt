         Subject:         Mtg. Re: Proposed USCM Public Schools Summit

         At the suggestion of Mayor Richard Daley (D-Chicago, IL), Mayor Tom Menino
         (D-Boston, MA), Mayor Dannel Malloy (D-Stamford, CT), and Mayor Beverly
         O'Neill (D-Long Beach, CAl, the leadership of the u.S. Conference of
         Mayors (USCM) recently voted to formally request a "White House/Mayors
         Conference on Public Schools," similar to last year's White House
         conference on drug control. Mickey Ibarra has asked me to set up a
         meeting this week to discuss this request.

         If a consensus is reached that a White House conference is a positive
         idea, the upcoming USCM/Council of Great City Schools joint meeting in
         Detroit (October 15 - 18) may provide the appropriate opportunity to
         formally announce our intention to sponsor a public schools conference.

         Would you please ask someone to contact me regarding your availability for
      ·                                                                             Page 2 of2
I.




       a preliminary meeting on this proposal?   I'm considering Tuesday, October
       7, at llam or 4pm.  Thanks.
