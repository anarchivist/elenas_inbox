Subject:         Hutchison amendment

Spoke to Ann Ford and they are working the issue pretty hard.     They are
having state public health people call Approps. members.

Hutchison is still planning on offering the amend. with no offsets / she
thinks that CBO's estimate is wrong.  Some Reps. are unhappy with this
approach and believe it will undermine their efforts in the long run.

Bryant had told folks that Graham was objecting to Hutchison bringing up
the bill in this context.

Roth was weighing in on Stevens to get him to oppose the Amendment.

Harkin is taking the lead for the Dems.    Lautenberg will assist Harkin.

Govs. are making calls to Committee members to support the amendment.
