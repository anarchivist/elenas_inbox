TEXT:
I took a quick look this morning at some of the key O'Connor opinions this
morning and will get you copies before the meeting.  I hadn't realized how
relatively strong a view she had expressed on Estab Clause issues over the
years.  One striking fact is that she concurred not only in the Court's
opinion but also in Souter's passionate concurrence in Lee v. Weisman, the
5-4 decision striking down the rabbi's nondenominational prayer at the
public high school graduation.
I'll also give you Powell's concurrence in Wolman, which Seth suggested as
a model for Q'Connor.
        With Breyer and Ginsburg replacing White and Blackmun, the Court
is actually more
separationist-leaning than it was five years ago.
