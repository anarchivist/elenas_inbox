TEXT:
I think you're gone, but in case you decided to stick around longer ...
Did you ever have a chance to look at the domestic violence/family violence
amendment language in the welfare bill? The question is: what is the
interpretation of the language?
This issue is heating up, so any help you can give us is appreciated.
Thanks.
