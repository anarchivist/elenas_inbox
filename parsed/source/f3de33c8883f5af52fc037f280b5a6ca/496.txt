I have not heard back from Emily regarding    the Indian Gaming/NGA letter. But,
I did receive about 11 letters from tribal    leaders regarding the Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act/Narragansett support. What     should I do with these? Should I
still be sending these types of letters to    Interior with a cover letter from
Director of Correspondence Jim Dorskind?

Thanks for your help.
