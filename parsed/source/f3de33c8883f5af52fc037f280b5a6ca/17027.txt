MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




        1. Education: Legislative Issues -- The Labor-HHS appropriations conferees are
expected to meet next week. In addition to securing adequate funding for your priorities, we are
working to make sure that the final bill provides the funding and authority to proceed with the
national tests, and does not contain the Gorton Block Grant provision. Our overall strategy
involves convincing the Republicans that they will pay a heavy price, again, for opposing your
efforts to improve public education. Your radio address and charter schools event on Saturday
were key steps in that strategy, and will be followed in the coming days and weeks by additional
events we are now developing, involving the Vice President, Secretary Riley, and others. We
are also encouraging business leaders and opinion leaders like Finn and Ravitch to help make the
case for the Senate provisions that place NAGB in charge of the tests. We are continuing to
look for steps we can take to reduce the concerns of the Black and Hispanic caucuses, either
through adjustments to the testing proposal or agreements on other issues. Our strategy on the
block grant is simply to hold tight; given the close vote in the Senate and the inability of sponsors
of a comparable amendment in the House to generate support, we think we can win without
giving ground.

        2. Education: Voucher Study -- Thursday's New York Times carried a story on a
Harvard University study of the voucher program in Cleveland. Though the story provided a
favorable view of the voucher program in terms of student achievement gains and parental
satisfaction, the Education Department's analysis ofthe evaluation study points out that the study
examined students in only two of the fourty one schools participating in the voucher program,
and that these two schools were better financed and in other ways not at all representative of the
other voucher schools. Later this Fall, the Ohio Department of Education will release the results
of the state-commissioned evaluation of the voucher program, which will cover all participating
schools. We do not know what this study will show.
                                                                          HeX-Dump Conversion
        3. Welfare Reform: Children's SSI Terminations -- House Ways and Means
Subcommittee Chainnan Clay Shaw and other House Republicans held a press conference last
Wednesday to rebut claims by advocates that the children's SSI cuts are too. severe. They
released a new GAO report that validates SSA's new childhood disability standard, judging it to
be consistent with the welfare refonn law and not overly strict. They also praised a recent a
random sample study by SSA of 40 children whose benefits were tenninated, arguing that it
showed the new standard is fair. Advocates are attacking the study. SSA continues to tell the
press that it is committed to a fair process and that it is following up on areas where advocates
have highlighted problems.        At his confinnation hearing, Ken Apfel committed to a
"top-to-bottom" review of the process within 30 days after he is confinned. Some press stories
have erroneously said the review will include the new standard itself, in addition to SSA's
process. As you know, in a recent meeting with disability advocates, you stated that you had
asked SSA to report to you on their process within 30 days (by October 10).

        4. Welfare Reform: Child Support Enforcement Computer Systems -- You asked
whether we could do anything to help address Senator Feinstein's concerns that California and
other states will lose all federal child support funds -- and eventually all TANF funds -- if they do
not have a statewide child suppport computer system operating by October 1st. We believe we
can and should help, but not by supporting Senator Feinstein's proposed six month moratorium
on state penalties. We instead propose to accept the Ways and Means Committee's invitation to
develop legislation which would provide us with additional penalty options, i.e., sanctions of
5-15% of federal funds, that would be. tough but reasonable.

        We believe strongly, as does Secretary Shalala, that supporting legislation which waives
all penalties would signal to states that we are not serious about enforcing child support rules and
may even encourage some states to slow their efforts to complete their systems this year.
Because these systems are a fundamental underpining of the new interstate enforcement
measures in the new welfare law, we want to push states to put them in place as soon as possible.
 These computer requirements were enacted in 1988 as part of the Family Support Act, and the
deadline has already been extended once, from 10/1195 to 10/1/97.

       We expect that a new proposal we develop this fall with the Ways and Means committee
could be enacted before we would actually withhold federal funds from any state under the
current law rules. State have until December 31 st to infonn HHS whether they've met the
October 1st deadline, and then the process which follows, including appeals, will take several
months. Thus, as we have told Senator Feinstein, there is for all practical purposes a six month
moratorium already in place. Thus, we believe supporting a moratorium through legislation
would simply signal a lack of resolve on child support enforcement and invite future pleas for
clemency.

       We believe that as many as eight states (California, Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, Maryland, D.C., Nevada, and Hawaii) will not meet the October 1st deadline. Experts tell
us that California is probably two to three years away from having a functioning state-wide

                                                                          .H~ ConVCll'Slon

     computer system in place. In preparation for upcoming discussions with the Ways and Means
     Committee, we have established a work group of DPC, NEC, OMB, and HHS staff to examine
     policy options.

              5. Welfare Reform: Fair Labor Standards ActIMinimum Wage -- House Ways and
     Means Human Resources Subcommittee Chairman Clay Shaw is quietly trying to garner
     bipartisan support for a bill to address state concerns about the cost of workfare programs and
     fulfill Speaker Gingrich's pledge to fix what he called the Administration's effort" to undermine
     and destroy welfare reform" by applying the minimum wage and other worker protections to
     working welfare recipients. Shaw's goal is to move the measure as a separate, bipartisan piece
     of legislation, but the latest reports indicate that -he's having trouble fashioning a compromise
     conservative enough for House Republicans that Democrats will agree to.

             Shaw's latest version appealed to Governor Carper and Chiles, but was not conservative
     enough for the House GOP leadership. We saw two major problems with this proposal. First,
     although Shaw said it was not his intention, the bill appears to weaken labor protections by using
     a definition of work experience and community service that doesn't make clear that they are
     employees.     Second, Shaw's draft bill significantly weakens the welfare law's work
     requirements. It requires states to pay the minimum wage for work experience and community
     service programs, but it limits the number of work hours to what states can afford to pay, based
     on the amount of their welfare grant plus food stamps. The balance of a recipients' time could
     be spent on job search and education activities. Thus, a welfare recipient could work 10 hours a
     week and do 10 hours of job search. The bill would also exempt workfare positions from FICA
     and unemployment taxes, which we indicated during the balanced budget negotiations that we
     were willing to do.

             6. Welfare Reform: Privatization of Food Stamps and Medicaid Programs -- By law,
     the Department of Agriculture has until October 3 to act on a new request from Arizona to
     privatize food stamp operations in 13% of the state. (The state is also seeking to privatize
     Medicaid, but HHS has no deadline for action because the welfare law's new 60-day timeclock
     applies only to food stamps.) USDA's options are to approve the waiver, deny it, or request
     more information. States can already privatize TANF operations without federal permission,
     and some states are moving in this direction. Wisconsin has already privatized TANF, and its
     request to privatize food stamps has been pending for well over a year.

              As you know, earlier this year we denied Texas's request to privatize food stamp and
     Medicaid operations in the entire state, leading to a major fight when Congress launched an
     effort to overturn this decision through legislation. During negotiations on this issue, we
     indicated our openness to a true demonstration affecting only part of the state, but Governor Bush
     rejected such a compromise. The Republicans have not resurrected the privatization issue so far
     this fall, in contrast to the workfarelFair Labor Standards Act fight.




                                                     3
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
        One potential defect of Arizona's proposal is that the area of the state that would be
subject to privatization will also be subject to major changes in the TANF program, modeled on
Wisconsin's. This might make it difficult to isolate the effect of privatization from other
factors. We do not know if Arizona would be willing to alter its plan to address this concern.
We are discussing with USDA how it might respond.

         7. Child Care: Adoption/Child Welfare -- On Thursday, a bi-partisan group of Senators --
including Senators Rockefeller, Chafee, Craig, Jeffords, Dewine, Bond, Coats, Levin and
Landrieu -- announced an agreement on child welfare legislation, called the Promotion of
Adoption, Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act (PASS). The PASS Act
represents the Senate version of the House adoption legislation which passed this past Spring,
which you endorsed. Through the Spring and Summer, Rockefeller had prevented speedy
Senate consideration of the House bill, in order to work on more ambitious Senate legislation.
The PASS Act incorporates many elements of the Administration's Adoption 2002 initiative,
including the principle of health and safety for children in foster care, financial incentives for
states to meet adoption targets, clarification of the "reasonable efforts" standard, and shortened
waiting times for children in foster care. The PASS Act also includes other measures, including
judicial reforms and health coverage for special needs children who are adopted. Unlike the
House bill, the Senate Act has budget implications, and the costs and off-sets are now under
review. The First Lady spoke with Senator Rockefeller on Thursday, indicating that the
Administration will quickly review the details of the Senate bill and urging Congress to work to
pass an adoption bill this year.

        8. Crime: Military Surplus Guns -- On Wednesday, Rep. McCarthy successfully struck
a provision in the House Treasury-Postal appropriations bill which would have reversed current
State Department guidance and allowed the importation of military surplus guns. There is no
similar provision in the Senate-passed Treasury spending bill. These guns--"curios and relics"--
were given or sold at very low prices to foreign governments over the last several decades
through our military assistance program. Treasury estimates that there are more than 2.5 million
of these weapons abroad, some of which can easily be converted into fully automatic firearms.
We were able to remove a similar provision during negotiations from last year's emergency
spending bill.

          9. Crime: Brady Law and Interstate Gun Trafficking -- On Friday, the Center to
  Prevent Handgun Violence released a study with evidence showing that the Brady Law has
  worked to help disrupt illegal gun trafficking patterns. The study found that states which did not
  require background checks for handgun purchases prior to enactment of the Brady Law ("Brady
. states"), became less important as source states for gun traffickers after implementation of the
  law. The study's findings suggest that those few jurisdictions that have stopped conducting
  background checks may inadvertently be inviting traffickers to locate in their communities.

            10. Immigration: Update on Expiring Programs -- There are three immigration
     programs set to expire on September 30, 1997. The Administration supports extending all three
     programs.

        Section 24S(i): This provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act permits aliens to
        remain in the U.S. and pay a $1,000 penalty pending a final determination of their
        immigration status. The main beneficiaries of section 245(i) are people who are eligible to
        immigrate but overstay visas while their residency applications are pending at INS. Under
        the 1996 immigration law, all illegal aliens must leave the U.S. or suffer penalties which
        include their inability to legally re-enter. The Senate-passed spending bill includes an
        extension ofthis provision, but the House Committee bill does not.

        Visa Waiver Pilot Program: This program permits visitors from qualifying countries to
        enter the U.S. for 90 days or less without a visa. Qualifying countries must meet several
        criteria including having a low visa refusal rate and extending a reciprocal privilege to U.S.
        citizen visitors. In 1996, over 12 million travelers from 25 countries participated in the
        program. The short term impact of the program lapsing would be a shortage of consular
        officers to' handle the spike in visa applications, and the possible rescission of reciprocal
        privileges for U.S. citizens. A Senate reauthorization bill which would expand the program
        to more countries is likely to be considered next week. Earlier this month, the House
        Immigration subcommittee marked up a two-year reauthorization bill containing some
        contentious unrelated provisions. DOJ prefers a straight reauthorization of the program.

        Special Visas for Religious Workers: This program admits certain religious workers into
        the U.S. for up to five years. Approximately 5,000 of these visas are issued annually. A
        temporary expiration of the program would delay the approval of a small number of pending
        applications. On Thursday, the Senate passed a bill to permanently reauthorize the existing
        program. The companion House legislation would reauthorize the program for three years
        and would require participants to have religious work experience to qualify; Justice has
        expressed some constitutional concerns with this version.
