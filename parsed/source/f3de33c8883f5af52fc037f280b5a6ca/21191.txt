TEXT:
Elena/Maria:
I received a call yesterday afternoon from William Gill, a staffer with
Congo Becerra/the Hispanic Caucus.   He was calling to ask about late
amnesty cases (Section' 377) . Congo Becerra wants to know what options are
available for relief for these folks and what steps we are taking to get
there.  I let him know that we are aware of the issue and are having
discussions with the Department of Justice to understand more about the
populations affected and the issues/options that we might have.   This is
likley the first of many calls on this from Becerra's office.   I spoke to
DOJ yesterday and let them know that we need to have their options paper
ASAP in order for us to make an informed decision about what, if anything,
we can do.
