          We have a confirmed date/time/location for the press conference to
          announce our international tobacco initiatives:

          --> Thursday, February 26, 1:00 p.m., in room 608 of the Dirksen
              Senate Office Building.

          Every organization that supports the initiatives is encouraged to
          attend and join the sponsoring Members of Congress behind the podium
"         when the Members speak.  (The statement of the initiatives, drafted
    by
          Matt Miller, is attached.)   Each organization should also feel free
    to
          bring its own press statement, even though most organizations will
    not
          be able to speak during the press conference because of the size of
          our group.

          Hope to see you Thursday.

                        Statement on International Tobacco Initiatives Hex-Dump Conversion


        Tobacco use is a growing threat to global public health. Today, tobacco products
account for three million deaths worldwide each year; by 2025, that number is expected to rise to
ten million per year, with over 70 percent of tobacco-related deaths occurring in developing
nations.

        As the world's leading exporter of tobacco products, the United States has a moral
responsibility to address. the adverse impact of its products on global public health. As a part of
any effort to address tobacco use, Congress should establish a responsible international health
policy by enacting these five proposals:

1. End U.S. Government SUDDort for Tobacco Abroad. The federal government should be
prohibited from promoting the sale or export of tobacco or tobacco products abroad. It should
also be prohibited from attempting to weaken a foreign tobacco regulation unless the regulation
discriminates against U.S. products in an arbitrary and unjustifiable manner and is not a
reasonable means of protecting the public health.
                 \

2. Adequately Fund Global Nongovernmental Tobacco Control Efforts. A private,
nonprofit organization should be established to assist public health organizations in other
countries through public education programs, technical assistance to health professionals, mass
media campaigns, grants and other general assistance.

3. Establish a Code of Conduct for Labeling and Advertising Overseas. U.S. tobacco
companies should be required to print health warning labels on tobacco products sold overseas
that are as stringent as those required in the United States. U.S. tobacco companies should also
be prohibited from selling, advertising or marketing tobacco products to children in other
countries, with the same standards applied to their overseas conduct as at home.

4. Stop International Tobacco Smuggling. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
which currently regulates alcohol smuggling, should be given authority to deter tobacco
smuggling through, among other things, a system of export permits and increased record keeping.

5. Fund International Tobacco Control Through a Licensing Fee. Every U.S. tobacco
company should pay a two-cent fee for each package of cigarettes it sells overseas. The money
raised through such a fee should be used for tobacco control efforts by governmental and
non-governmental entities.

       The United States has the opportunity to act as a world leader in promoting public health.
 If Congress passes any measure to confront domestic tobacco use, it must also tackle the health
problems caused by the use of American tobacco products abroad. We strongly endorse these
proposals to establish a responsible U.S. policy for the promotion of global public health.
