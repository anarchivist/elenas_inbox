     Q:   WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO ROBERT PEAR'S STORY ABOUT THE
          MENTAL HEALTH PARITY REGULATION?

     A:   This Administration has an unparalleled record of supporting ending discrimination in
          mental health. First, the portability provisions in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation
          represented a major victory for mental health advocates as it explicitly prevents insurers
          from using preexisting conditions as a basis for excluding people with mental illnesses
          from access to health plans. Secondly, we fought for and secured the passage of the
          mental health parity provisions that are discussed in today's story. And this year in the
          balanced budget act we worked hard to ensure that a strong mental health provision was
          included in the children's health initiative.

          With regard to the mental health parity law discussed in today's story, no decisions have
          made in any interpretation of the law. The three departments (HHS, Labor, and
          Treasury) that are responsible for administering this regulation have not made any
          decisions much less forwarded any recommendations to the Office of Management and
          Budget. Even when they do, OMB's Office of Infonnation and Regulatory Affairs must
          review and make a final determination on the appropriate interpretation and
          implementation of the law by the Administration.

          Clearly, because of our longstanding commitment to mental health care, we will do
          everything possible to ensure that this law is implemented in a way that ensures that the
          promise of the legislation is real.
