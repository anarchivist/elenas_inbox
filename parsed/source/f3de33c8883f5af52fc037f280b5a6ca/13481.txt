Just wanted to give you a heads up on an Indian Gaming Issue that
we will probably be getting calls on soon. This morning, the
Supreme Court handed down a decision in a huge Indian Gaming Case
-- Seminole Tribe vs. Florida -- which deals a severe blow to
Tribes who are unable to negotiate a gaming compact with a
Governor. The Court ruled 5-4 that Congress cannot expose states
to federal lawsuits when negotiations break down between a Tribe
and a Governor over placing gaming operations on reservations.
Some background: The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988
requires Tribes to negotiate with Governors over the types of
casino-type gaming that they can operate on Tribal land (Tribes
have the power to run bingo operations without any state
approval). If a compact cannot be reached, IGRA gives the Tribes
the right to sue the state for not negotiating in "good faith."
States have long claimed immunity from such suits under the 11th
Amendment.  In today's ruling, the Supreme Court agreed with the


State's claim.
This ruling is extraordinary in that it one of the few to ever
limit Congress' virtually exclusive power to make laws affecting
American Indians (although it really doesn't limit Congress' power
over the Tribes themselves, just their ability to expose states to
a judicial remedy).   Its practical affect is yet to be seen -- at
the very least it will take away a powerful tool that Tribes had
to force a reluctant Governor to sit down and negotiate a compact.
This ruling won't so much impact Tribes that already have gaming,
but it will impact Tribes seeking gaming, especially in states
with Governors who have historically been reluctant to negotiate.

In the short term, I would guess that we will be getting calls
from Indian Country asking the POTUS to take some action
on this issue. There is really nothing we can do, but Indian
Country has long argued that the Secretary of Interior has the
power to approve Tribally-run off-reservation gaming without a
Governor's sign-off, and they will probably do so once again. The
states obviously disagree, and we have consistently agreed with
the states on this issue, but we will likely hear about this issue
from Tribes. This will also increase pressure on Congress to pass
some version of the long-dormant IGRA Amendments.
Justice and Interior are working to analyze this decision.   It
literally came out this morning, so they are just today getting
copies of the 200+ page decision.  They will hopefully get us a
better analysis of this decision sometime next week, but in the
meantime I wanted to pass this on to you FYI.
