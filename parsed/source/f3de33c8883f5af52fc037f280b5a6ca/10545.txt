TEXT:
HHS called and said that Biden's office is planning on dropping their VAWA
II bill tentatively on January 20.   Biden's office asked whether Sh~lala
could attend on January 20. We had talked about doing our own event with
possibly the VP at a later time.   I said I would get back to HHS.  Let me
know your thoughts.  Thanks, Mary
