TEXT:
TO:                 DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
                    DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                    DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM:      OMB   LE~ISLATIVE   AFFAIRS

DATE:      FEBRUARY 26, 1997

SUBJECT:            LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Director Raines testified on the Presidento,s Budget this morning before
the Joint Economic Committee, as part of a series 'of three hearings
following the release of the Presidento,s Economic Report.   The first
hearing featured former CEA Chairman Joseph Stiglitz, and in the third
hearing, Chairman Greenspan will testify before the Committee in March.

Senator Torricelli held a press conference today at 3:30 pm where he
announced that he will vote against S.J.Res. 1, the Balanced Budget
Amendment (BBA) , as introduced by Senator Hatch.  In the press conference,
he stated that the BBA, unamended, does not meet the standards to amend
the Constitution.   In the hour before his press conference, the Senate
defeated TorricelliO,s amendment by a vote of 37 to 63 (see description
below) .

The House Democrat CoalitionD,s 22 members unveiled their o&Common Sense
Balanced Budget for FY 1998" in a Press Conference this afternoon.  In
their Press Release, the Coalition characterized their budget as a o&plan
that not only balances the budget by 2002 with a surplus, but also
balances in 2005 without relying on the Social Security trust fund and
balances by 2007 without relying on any trust funds at all.oS (Please call
our office at 5-4790 if you would like copies of their package.)

CONGRESS TODAY (2/25):

SENATE:
Tabled (67-33) Feinstein substitute amendment to the BBA;

Failed to pass (37-63) the Torricelli amendment that would have permitted
capital budgeting, amended the military waiver, and provided majority
waivers for recession;

Tabled (59-41) the Dorgan substitute amendment, which, like the Reid
amendment, would have excluded the Social Security trust fund from the
resolution.   (The Reid amendment was a perfecting amendment rather than a
substitute. )

Tabled (40-60) the Boxer amendment

Under a UC agreement, Members had to submit any amendments to the BBA by
5:00 pm this afternoon. (Republicans reserved 4 unspecified amendments.
Hollings did not offer his amendment regarding campaign finance.)

HOUSE:
Suspended the rules and passed the following bills: .
(416-0)  H.R. 624, Armored Car Reciprocity
        [SAP sent, 2/26: No objection]

         [No SAP]
(347-73) H.R. 668, Airport and Airway Trust Fund Tax Reinstatement Act of
1997
         [SAP sent, 2/25: Administration strongly supports]
