 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:          Bruce Reed
                Elena Kagan

 RE:            DPC Weekly Report


           Tobacco -- Court Decision on Second Hand Smoke: This week, a Federal district
  court judge in North Carolina granted the tobacco industry's motion for summary judgment in a
  case challenging the EPA's 1993 risk assessment report declaring environmental tobacco smoke
  a Class A carcinogen which causes lung cancer. Specifically, the court found that the EPA
  failed to follow proper procedure requiring industry representation on an advisory committee
  responsible for providing advice to the EPA regarding the risk assessment, and held that since
  industry participation could have influenced the scientific findings in the report, this did not
  constitute harmless error. Notably, the industry did not challenge the EPA's findings regarding
  the harmful respiratory effects of children's exposure to ETS. In addition, numerous studies
  since 1993 have confirmed the EPA's findings that ETS is harmful to both adults and children.
  There is concern, however, that the industry will attempt to use this victory to challenge state and
  local anti-smoking ordinances. The EPA is currently consulting with DO] regarding a possible
  appeal of this decision. We hope to schedule a September event for you to announce that the
. EPA will appeal, and to unveil a new EPA public service announcement which targets ETS in
  the home by informing parents of ways to protect their children from second hand smoke i.e., by
  smoking outdoors (smoking by parents in the home is a major source children's exposure to
  second hand smoke, which can cause sudden infant death syndrome, asthma, ear infections,
  bronchitis and pneumonia).

         Health Care -- Provider Taxes: After your line-item veto of New York's provider
 taxes last Fall, we notified all states of our desire to work with them to ensure that they no
 longer used impermissible provider taxes to help fund the state portion of their Medicaid
 programs. At that time, we advised states of our intention to support legislation that gives
 the Secretary the authority to waive the collection of any funds owed because of
 impermissible provider taxes if they are brought into compliance. However, we also
 informed states that if Congress did not grant us that authority by August of this year, we
 would be forced to start disallowance process. As August approaches, it is becoming clear
 that Congress has no intention of passing this legislation. States that have potentially
 impermissible provider taxes have not worked to pass this legislation because they believe,
 based on previous experience, that we have no intention of enforcing this law. Members
 from states who are not relying on impermissible taxes do not have any desire to pass
 legislation that would forgive states for having illegal financing schemes. We met on
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

Thursday to discuss whether we should start our enforcement activities, and if so when.
The meeting concluded with a recommendation to delay action until after the Congress
adjourns. This will help to ensure that Congress and the states cannot criticize us because
they were not given sufficient time to pass the necessary legislation. However, we are
checking with the counsel's office at Justice and HHS to determine if we can delay
implementation without raising legal concerns about the Federal government's lack of
enforcement of current law.

       Education -- NEAlAFf International Teachers Congress Speech: On July 29 you
will speak to the International Congress of Teachers, an international teachers
organization tied to both NEA and ATF. Because national education standards are
common place in most other industrialized countries, this forum provides a good
opportunity to restate the case for national standards and tests, and to renew your threat to
veto the appropriations bill if it blocks work on the test, and if it fails to support necessary
education investments.

       Welfare Reform -- Mayor Giuliani's New Plan: In a July 20th speech, Mayor Giuliani
announced he would eliminate welfare by 2000, with everyone engaged in some kind of work.
He promised to move New York from the welfare capital to the work capital. The Mayor
harkened back to FDR's notion ofa social contract and cited RFK's concerns about welfare
rendering millions of Americans dependent on handouts and thus unable to playa role in the
democracy. Apparently he added a positive reference to your support for welfare refonn which
was not in his written remarks.

        Guiliani's new approach has lots of parallels to Wisconsin -- not too surprising, since he
recently hired Jason Turner, Governor Thompson's former welfare reform guru. While not
publicly backing away from the workfare program he has championed, the mayor is making
workfare one part ofa comprehensive work first, employment-focused approach which includes
private sector unsubsidized and subsidized employment. For example, he cited that over
250,000 people have gained skills and work habits they need to join the work force through the
workfare program, but he challenged every business to give someone an opportunity to move
from welfare to work.

        The Mayor proposed to transfonn every welfare office into an employment center, divert
applicants to work if possible so that welfare is the last rather than first resort, require mothers
with newborns to attend a parenting class, expect those with disabilities not severe enough to
qualify for disability payments to work (in specialized settings if necessary), and compel those
with substance abuse problems to participate in work and treatment.

        The Mayor's new approach sets very high expectations for both recipients and the welfare
system. The question will be whether something this ambitious can be accomplished in NYC
given its size, bureaucracy, political dynamics, and continuing high unemployment. It will be
difficult for the nearly universal work requirement to succeed unless the mayor ensures that

adequate supports, i.e., child care, work-focused drug treatment, appropriate work opportunities
for those with disabilities, are in place. In New York, as elsewhere, we must work to ensure that
individuals applying for welfare obtain Food Stamps and Medicaid as need be.
        Welfare Reform -- NGA Report on Employment Retention and Career
Advancement: On July 28th the National Governors Association will release a report
financed by UUS on how states can help people remain employed once they have left
welfare. The report emphasizes that "work first" does not simply mean placing people in
entry level jobs -- it is about working with people after they are employed to help them
keep their jobs, avoid returning ·to welfare, and advance within the labor market. This
requires focusing on providing work-based learning and skill development that meets
employers' needs for skilled workers. The report generally suggests states should:
promote learning at the workplace; help people get jobs that give them access to career
ladders; improve the quality of "transitional employment" such as work experience by
combining it with education, training, career guidance and job placement; and improve
access to education and training that complements work. To help people retain
employment, NGA encourages: ongoing case management and mentoring; access to
supportive services such as child care, transportation, health care, housing; and financial
incentives such as the federal and state earned income tax credits. The report highlights
innovative approaches in a number of states and communities. We are working with UUS
to put out a press release on Tuesday praising the report and highlighting a May NGA
fiscal report showing state are investing more in child care and work.

        Welfare Reform -- Washington State Report: A recent survey by the State of
Washington shows relatively high levels of employment and earnings for people who left
welfare between December 1997 and February 1998. Sixty-eight percent are currently
working at an average hourly wages of $8.42. Total family income for these families,
including child support, was 137% of the federal poverty level. Though Washington has a
generous child care program, only 31 percent of families reported using subsidized care.
More than half responded that they didn't need subsidies because they received care for
free. This may be because a substantial number of people reported working nights and
weekends, when people are more likely to use relatives or friends. While most people
reported they had health insurance, this remains an area of concern: respondents reported
that 35 percent of adults and 20 percent of children had no health insurance. Washington
will be updating this study on a regular basis.

       Welfare Reform -- North Carolina Conference on Job Retention: Governor Hunt
has invited several thousand businesses to participate in a 'Work First Retention
Conference' on July 30th. The Welfare-to-Work Partnership is co-sponsoring the event
and Eli Segal will participate. Aida Alvarez may also participate. Businesses will share
successful strategies for reducing turnover through transportation, mentoring, supervisor
training, and skills upgrading.

        Disability Issues -- Event for ADA Anniversary and Disability Task Force: This
coming Wednesday, you will commemorate the eighth anniversary of the Americans with
Disabilities Act by signing a directive recommended by your Task Force on Employment of
Adults with Disabilities. You created the Task Force by executive order in March, and it is
co-chaired by Secretary Herman and Tony Coelho. Its mandate is to determine what the federal
government can do to help bring the employment rate of adults with disabilities "as close as
possible" to that of the general population. The directive will instruct DOJ, EEOC, and SBA to
do more outreach on the ADA, and instruct HHS to do more outreach about a new Medicaid state
option to allow people with disabilities to buy into Medicaid as their earnings increase (an
Administration proposal that was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act last year).

        In addition, you will announce that we are working with Sens. Kennedy and Jeffords on
additional health care legislation for people with disabilities who want to return to work. This
will be very good news to the disability community, since it is their top priority. The Senators
have introduced a bill with a cost of $5 billion over five years. We are working with their staff
on a more affordable alternative.

       Children and Families -- Nutrition BilJ. With Administration support, the House on
Monday passed a reauthorization bill for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); the Summer Food Service Program; the Farmers Market
Nutrition Program; the Nutrition Education and Training Program; and State administrative
support for the School Lunch Program. The bill moves forward your after-school care agenda
by incorporating Administration recommendations -- such as enabling States that are enrolled in
the School Lunch and Breakfast Program to provide snacks to children in after-school education
and enrichment programs, and allowing institutions that provide after-school care for "at-risk"
school children aged 12 through 18 to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program.
The bill also strengthens protections against WIC fraud and abuse, and requires states
participating in WIC to provide program participants with education on drugs and alcohol abuse
and their effects on children.    The Senate is expected to act on its bill shortly.

        Children and Families -- Child Care: On Thursday, the House voted unanimously
out of full committee the Quality Child Care for Federal Employees Act, and both the
House and Senate are likely to pass the bill by unanimous consent next week. The
legislation in part mirrors the executive memorandum you issued in March to improve
federally-sponsored child care in the executive branch, by ensuring proper background
checks of child care providers, and achieving full accreditation of child care facilities. The
pending legislation applies to all federally sponsored child care (executive, judicial and
legislative branches), and includes other important provisions, such as: (1) giving GSA new
oversight responsibilities for most federally-sponsored child care and directing GSA to
develop, issue and enforce uniform health and safety standards; and (2) authorizing
agencies to use appropriated funds for child care tuition subsidies. The Senate sponsors
are Jeffords and Landrieu; the House sponsors are Gilman and Morella.

        Crime/Guns -- Appropriations: During the Senate's consideration of the Commerce,
Justice appropriations bill this week, a few important gun issues received floor votes. 1) Child
Safety Locks -- Senator Boxer's amendment to require federal gun dealers to provide a child

safety lock with every handgun was tabled by a vote of 61-39, but a Craig amendment to simply
require dealers to make firearm safety devices available for sale passed by 72-28; 2) Child
Access Prevention -- Senator Durbin's amendment to establish liability for failure to store
firearms away from children was tabled by a vote of 69-31; and 3) Brady Law Implementation        OM




Senator Smith's (R-NH) amendment to prohibit the FBI from collecting a fee for Brady
background checks when the National Insta-Check System goes into effect in November 1998
passed with a 69-31 vote. The Smith amendment also requires the FBI to immediately destroy
records collected pursuant to background checks and creates a federal cause of action if the FBI
fails to do so. If FBI cannot charge a fee for checks, DOJ estimates that the cost will be $75
million in the first year; this figure could increase substantially every year, dependent upon the
states' interest or continued ability to do their own background checks.

        Crime -- Juvenile Crime Legislation: This week, Sen. Sessions attempted to attach the
Senate juvenile crime bill as an amendment to Commerce, Justice appropriations. While
Sessions ultimately withdrew the amendment, Majority Leader Lott indicated that he would try to
set aside floor time in September for consideration of the bill.

        Drugs -- Methamphetamine Penalties: This week, the House Judiciary Committee
marked up legislation to equalize federal penalties for methamphetamine trafficking with those
for crack cocaine (5 grams = 5 years mandatory sentence; 50 grams = 10 years mandatory
sentence). Under current law, 10 grams of pure meth triggers the 5-year mandatory sentence and
100 grams ofmeth triggers the 10-year sentence. Conversely, the Senate Commerce, Justice
appropriations bill contains language included by Senator Hutchison (R-TX) which would
essentially eviscerate DEA's regulatory enforcement authority over precursor chemicals for drugs
such as methamphetamine. The Hutchison language would: I) substantially raise the standard to
prove violations of certain record-keeping and reporting violations ofthe Controlled Substances
Act; and 2) lower the maximum civil penalty from $25,000 to $500 for most cases. Both
measures substantially weaken provisions that were recently strengthened in the Comprehensive
Methamphetamine Control Act you signed into law in 1996.

        Partial Birth Abortion: On Thursday, the House successfully voted to override your
veto of the Partial Birth Abortion bill by a vote of296-132. Proponents of the bill picked up
only one vote. A Senate vote is not yet scheduled.
