TEXT:
probably while we were discussing tobacco in your office, Bruce. He
wanted to relay that his GOP consultant says GOP governors are getting a
bit nervous, but still think it's too early to compromise. The GOP
governors are hearing from the GOP House appropriators that while we're
raising objections to the Hutchison provision they aren't sure we'll veto
over it. Matt's wondering it we can have some tougher sounding quiet
conversations.  I didn't give him any hope.
