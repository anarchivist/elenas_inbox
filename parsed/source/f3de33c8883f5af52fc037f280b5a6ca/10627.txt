                       RANGEL: BILL WANTS 'EM TO STAY BRONX BOMBERS

                       By DAVID SEIFMAN



                      President Clinton favors keeping the Yankees in
                      The Bronx and using a rejuvenated stadium to
                      anchor redevelopment of the area, Rep. Charles
                      Rangel (D-Manhattan) told The Post.

                      The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
                      Development has prepared a document for Clinton
                      detailing a number of development plans involving
                      the House That Ruth Built, including proposals put
                      forward by Mayor Giuliani, Yankee owner George
                      Steinbrenner and Bronx Borough President
                      Fernando Ferrer, Rangel said.

                      The congressman said Clinton told him Jan. 5,
                      "We need Yankee Stadium and we need it in The
                      Bronx. It's a national monument."

                      He said Clinton also said, "You know the Yankees'
                      victory has put new gusto into baseball. When you
                      think about [Mark] McGwire and [Sammy] Sosa
                      and you think about the whole season, and with
                      the NBA problems, we need the Yankees."

                      Last week Rangel met with the president's budget
                      advisers to discuss including money in the next
                      federal budget for a Harlem-South Bronx
                      empowerment zone that would include Yankee
                      Stadium.

                      "We're looking at this as not just a city problem,
                      but that Yankee Stadium is a national landmark
                      within a federal empowerment zone," Rangel said.

                      "This goes beyond Yankee Stadium. We're talking
                      about that whole are_a," he said.

                      Rangel sponsored a 1993 law that put parts of
                      Harlem and the South Bronx in an empowerment
                      zone that would give tax breaks to companies that
                      build in the area and provide jobs for local
                      residents.

                      Because the Stadium is in the zone, any
                      development there could take advantage of those
                      breaks.

                      Clinton is rumored to be considering unveiling a
                      South Bronx development plan in his State of the
                      Union Address on Jan. 19, one source said.

                      The president also may say something about the
                      Stadium when the Yankees visit the White House
                      in March to be acknowledged as the World Series
                      champions, Rangel said. But he added that he
                      does not know if the president's enthusiasm will
                      translate into a willingness to commit federal
                      money.

                      Clinton is far from advocating a specific plan.



                      "He wants to support any plan he could with city,
                      state and private sector support to keep Yankee
                      Stadium in The Bronx," Rangel said.

                      Rangel, whose congressional district does not
                      include the Stadium, stressed that the important
                      players in the Stadium question are Giuliani,
                      Steinbrenner, Ferrer and state economic
                      development chief Charles Gargano.

                      Ferrer has advocated a "Yankee Village" plan that
                      calls for renovating the Stadium by adding luxury
                      boxes and other amenities, revitalizing a
                      commercial strip nearby, and building a new
                      Metro-North rail station, 10,500 parking spots and
                      a regional retail center at the Bronx Terminal
                      Market.

                      The mayor's office did not return calls for
                      comment on the Stadium.

                      New York magazine reports in this week's issue
                      that the congressman had dinner with the Boss
                      the same day he spoke with the president.

                      "1 hope the president gives [Steinbrenner] an offer
                      he can't refuse," Rangel told the magazine.

                      Steinbrenner spokesman Howard Rubenstein told
                      The Post the Yankees owner is excited by
                      Clinton's interest but will consider Giuliani's wishes
                      before committing to any plan.

                      "The Yankees are certainly pleased that the
                      president has recognized the national importance
                      of the South Bronx and the Yankees as a national
                      treasure.

                      "This might be a tremendous boost to not only the
                      Yankees but to housing, transportation and full
                      economic development of that area," Rubenstein
                      said.
