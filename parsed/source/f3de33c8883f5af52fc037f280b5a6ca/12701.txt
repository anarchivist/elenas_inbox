             This is from Jack Kristy.

             Wei-Min, et, aI,

             After struggling with all of the issues and options raised, it seems that
             neither our current language nor Elena's testing language would clearly
             prohibit states from having separate (distinct form reading, math, etc.)
             English proficiency standards and using those standards to retain/promote
             LEP students.   It seems our policy goal is to do that, except in making
 "




graduation decisions (e.g. New York).

In addition, we're very concerned about affecting the assessment language
in
a manner that would make it inconsistent with Title I.

AS a result, one more try:  this is essentially the language of the
"special
rule", but given less prominence in subsection (c) this time. As you can
see, we have also added the Spanish-language language.
