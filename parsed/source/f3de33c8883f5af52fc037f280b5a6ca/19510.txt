TEXT:
        Good Afternoon.  In the coming weeks, the Congress will be making
many important decisions on how we can best prepare our children for the
21st Century.

         First, we have an historic opportunity to pass bipartisan
legislation to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco.   This
legislation would put an end to the tobacco industryD,s calculated,
multi-million dollar media campaign to hook our children to the deadly
habit of smoking. For years, the cartoon character Joe Camel was the star
of their efforts to create a new generation of customers for cigarettes--
what the tobacco industry callously called D&replacement smokers.DB

        Even as the tobacco executives denied they were targetting
children, Joe Camel became as recognizable to our children as Mickey
Mouse. Now some in Congress say that teen smoking has D,hing to doDB
with Joe Camel.   Medical science and common sense makes it plain: teen
smoking has everything to do with Joe Camel, with unscrupulous marketing
campaigns that prey on the insecurities and dreams of our children. The
tobacco industry spent hundreds of millions of dollars on such marketing
campaigns. [refer to American Medical Association study] ItO,s plain as
day that cartoon camels are not designed to appeal to adults.


        ItO,s time to end this horrible history once and for all. I call
on Congress to pass strong, bipartisan tobacco legislation. And I call on
leaders of both parties to work together for our children.
