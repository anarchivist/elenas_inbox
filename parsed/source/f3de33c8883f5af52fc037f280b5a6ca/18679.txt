TEXT:
David is an editorial writer for the Oregonian and will be in town the
first week of march.  He is a really good guy.  He wants to talk with
either one of you about HMO-Health Care Bill of Rights & tobacco.  He met
with Bruce a few years ago (I think).  pIs let me know if you're available
or whom I should work with in your shop to schedule something with him and
either one of you.   Thanks!
