TEXT:
I just met with Wade Randlett, the political director for the high-tech
ceo groups.  I think we can put together a good, brief and easy testing
event with POTUS next Wed--just before he goes to New Jersey.   There is a
very good chance we can set up a meeting with John Doer, Jim Barksdale and
5 other Republican high tech CEO's. They are all going to be in DC that
day for a series of meetings on the hill, primarily with Republican
leadership as well as Goodling. The meetings are mainly on a noneducation
issue, but they were planning on taking up the tests, especially with
Goodling.

I would envision a 15-20 minute meeting in the Oval, during which everyone
can agree on how important the tests are.  They can follow POTUS out to
Marine One, be there for a departure statement in which POTUS tells the
press that these guys have just told him that they are convinced we need
national tests for the economy of the future.  They nod in agreement, and
talk about how they are going to deliver that message to Congress later in
the day.


I  just talked to Ann Lewis about this; she think's its a great idea. We
had talked earlier today about the possibility of a departure statement.
If we don't do this, we may have to endorse Rangel's school construction
tax credit that no one can explain. Ways and Means is scheduled to mark
up Coverdell that day, and Rangel is going to offer his as a substitute.
