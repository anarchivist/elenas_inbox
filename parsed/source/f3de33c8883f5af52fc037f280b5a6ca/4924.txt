Dear Mr. Speaker,

        Thank you very much for your letter of October 3rd regarding tobacco legislation and our
meeting with Members of Congress. I agree with you that the meeting was productive and
bipartisan, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with you in the fight against teen
smoking.

        I also agree with you that the problem of tobacco addiction is only one of many
challenges that face our nation's young people. While we seek to combat youthful tobacco use,
we must also maintain and strengthen our strong attack on substance abuse by American youth.
I am proud of my record in fighting drugs. I have proposed, year-in and year-out, the largest
anti-drug budgets of any Administration. The country has benefited greatly from my
appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as our nation's drug czar and his elevation to a Cabinet
level position. I hope you will join in the effort to protect our children by supporting my
proposed fiscal 1998 budget which contains a $60 million expansion of the Safe and Drug-Free
Schools Program. This program reaches 97% of the nation's school districts, and the program's
funds are used to keep violence, drugs and alcohol away from students and out of schools.

       Your letter points out that General McCaffrey has much to contribute to our effort in
controlling underage use of drugs and tobacco. I agree. Indeed, I have specifically requested
the House of Representatives include in H.R. 2610 a provision codifying the reduction of
underage substance abuse, including alcohol and tobacco, as within the scope of General
McCaffrey's office. With your help, our nation will succeed in building a strong and
comprehensive abuse policy that includes drugs, alcohol and tobacco.

        As we have discussed, there is no more important mission for our nation than the
protection of our children's health. In the next year, we will have the opportunity to make major
steps in combating the tragedy of substance abuse and youth smoking. I look forward to taking
those steps together.
