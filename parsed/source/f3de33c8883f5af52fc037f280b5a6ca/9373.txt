MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report

        Education -- Single Sex Schools: Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson has indicated to
the Education Department that she still intends to pursue her amendment to allow funds
from Title VI of ESEA to be used for single sex schools if comparable opportunities are
made available to both genders, despite the Department's position that the amendment is
unnecessary and could lead to confusion at the 10calleveI. She has indicated that she will
offer it as an amendment to the early literacy bill (which will almost certainly kill that bill)
unless we help her draft an amendment to the appropriations bill that would be acceptable
to us. Women's groups and Senate Democrats, including in particular Senator Harkin
and Senator Kennedy, are strongly opposed to the Hutchinson amendment and are
developing substitute amendments that would make single sex schools even more difficult
to establish.

        Education -- Charter Schools: We have been working with Senators Kennedy and
Coats to bring the charter schools bill to the Senate floor. The major obstacle is an
amendment Senator Harkin has been insisting on, that would provide funds to schools that
are innovative, though not charter schools, in states without charter legislation. Harkin is
apparently interested in securing support for several innovative schools in Iowa (which has
not passed charter schools legislation), and is also not a supporter of the charter schools
legislation. Senator Coats and most charter schools advocates are adamantly opposed to
this amendment, for fear that it will be the first step towards weakening the underlying
principles that distinguish charter schools from other public schools. Secretary Riley will
be talking to Senator Harkin later today, to attempt to find some other way to meet Senator
Harkin's needs. If he does not succeed, we believe it may be necessary for you to call
Senator Harkin to secure his cooperation.

       Education -- Dollars to the Classroom/Class Size: On Friday morning the House
defeated your class size reduction proposal (216-190) and passed the Dollars to the
Classroom Block Grant (212-198).

       Crime -- Juvenile Crime: This week, the House attached two major House juvenile
crime bills passed last year -- H.R. 3, which we oppose, and HR 1818, a prevention bill which we
support -- to a noncontroversial Senate bill reauthorizing funds for the Center for Missing and
Exploited Children. The bill passed on the suspension calendar by a vote of 280-126. The
sure to oppose the move to appoint conferees.

                Crime -- COPS Grants: This week, the COPS Office released over $20 million
in grants to 27 jurisdictions to hire 331 officers. Next week, the COPS Office wi II release over
$300 million in grants, including: (1) $200 million COPS MORE grants to 600 law enforcement
agencies to fund 10,000 police and police equivalents; (2) $100 million under a long-awaited
waiver for Los Angeles to fund over 700 new officers; and (3) roughly $6 million to four other
law enforcement agencies in California to hire an additional 82 officers.

         Children and Families --Head Start: On Monday, the House passed a Head Start
Reauthorization bill, stripping from the bill objectionable provisions added in Committee (such
as vouchers), on the insistence of the Administration and House Democrats. The Senate has
already passed a strong Head Start Reauthorization bill, paving the way for a speedy conference,
and, we hope, a bill signing ceremony next month in which we can highlight the important
achievements in the Head Start program during your Presidency. Both the House and Senate
bills reauthorize the program at sums near your request and add important new goals for the
program, such as "school readiness." A likely conference debate will be whether additional new
investments in Head Start should be targeted to improving quality or serving more children. Our
position has been that we must maintain a careful balance between quality and expansion --
continuing to make needed improvements, but also serving more eligible children. While the
Senate bill adopts our position, the House bill unfortunately targets most new dollars into quality
improvements, such as salary enhancements, thereby precluding reaching our goal of serving I
million children. We will continue to fight in Conference to achieve a better balance between
these two important goals.

        Immigration -- H-2A Guestworkers: This past July the Senate passed an amendment
to the CJS appropriations bill, sponsored by Senators Wyden and Graham, that would create a
new agricultural guestworker (H-2A) program. This bill would severely weaken the labor
protections for migrant farmworkers and we have voiced our strong opposition to it. Since the
bill's passage (68 to 31), it has lost support among Senate Democrats, principally because labor
and Hispanic groups have made clear their vehement opposition. Last week, we met with a
group of Democratic staffers to discuss our serious substantive concerns with the bill's approach.
Our goal is to get this amendment stripped from the CJS bill and to do the real work of forging a
consensus reform solution with members of Congress over the next several months.

        Health Care -- Medicare Home Health Update: At your direction, we have been
providing technical assistance to the Congressional Committee's of jurisdiction in their efforts to
develop changes to the BBA's home health care reimbursement provisions that the industry (Val
Halamandaris) feels are harming providers and their ability to provide quality service to
Medicare beneficiaries. On Tuesday, Ways and Means Subcommittee Chairman Bill Thomas
unveiled a new and fairly creative policy alternative that has some potential. It would raise per
beneficiary and industry payment rates and begin to moderate geographical reimbursement
disparities. Although not everything the home health folks wanted, Val (Elena: Val is a good
friend of the POTUS and the President asked us, as you will recall, to be helpful where we could)

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
it would cost $1.4 billion over 5 years and, rather than use Medicare program payment offsets,
would be paid for with the budget surplus. Following on the heels of the Democrats' strong vote
against surplus-funded tax cuts on Thursday, we believe they (and us) are likely to oppose the
proposal's financing. Although we might be able to sustain this position, it will place great
pressure on us to help produce Medicare offsets -- most of which are politically unviable. We
will be meeting with the Democrats on Friday and early next week to determine if we can come
up with an acceptable savings package and, regardless, how best to position ourselves on this
politically sensitive issue.

        Welfare Reform -- Grants to Study What Happens to People Leaving the Rolls: On
Friday, HHS awarded $3 million in grants to 10 states and 3 counties to help gather information
about outcomes of families who leave welfare. The studies will track employment and earnings;
returns to welfare; participation in Food Stamps, Medicaid, child support and child welfare; and
family and child well-being. Florida will look at the impact of welfare reform on different
ethnic groups, and Arizona's study will include a large Native American population.
Massachusetts will examine the first group offamilies to hit their 24-month time limit. Several
of the states will also track outcomes for families who are diverted from the rolls and for
those who are sanctioned.

        Welfare Reform -- New Federal Child Support Case Registry: Next month, HHS
will put in place another ofthe critical building blocks of the interstate child support system
proposed in your 1994 welfare reform bill and enacted in 1996. The Federal Case Registry, a
national database of child support cases, will make it easier to locate deadbeat parents,
particularly those living in other states. The registry will enable HHS to do automatic, daily
computer matches of parents who owe support (the Federal Case Registry) and a national
employee database (the National Directory of New Hires, a directory created in October 1997
which is updated daily with "new hire" information submitted by employers). These matches
will locate working parents who owe child support and provide states with the wage and
employer information they need to garnish the wages of the delinquent parent. States will begin
to submit their case registry data to HHS on October 1; HHS expects to have 30 states in its
system by the end of October and 40 states by the end of the year. In June, at the signing of the
Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, you announced that the National Directory of New Hires had
in nine months located one million delinquent parents; the launch of the Federal Case Registry
will make the new hire data even more useful by providing even more delinquent cases for it to
be matched against.

        Community Empowerment -- Regulation B: Last Spring, Treasury coordinated a
comment letter to the Federal Reserve signed by DOJ, OCC, OTS, SBA, FTC and HUD that
supported a proposal to amend Regulation B implementing the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to
allow, but not require, banks to voluntarily collect data on the race and income of loan applicants,
a practice currently prohibited. This data is already reported for home mortgage loans and has
proven critical to identifying gaps in access to capital. This revision of Reg B would begin to


                                                 3

                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
        allow banks to self-assess their outreach and approval practices for non-mortgage loans,
        especially small business loans. It would also build on the success of your reform of the
        Community Reinvestment Act. Although the Fed considered and rejected a similar proposal in
        December 1996, we believe the Fed may be more willing to approve the change at this time.
        Factors that may influence them favorably include the coordinated Administration letter,
        supportive comment letters from a few large banks, and recent changes in the composition of the
        Board of Govemors themselves. We now anticipate Federal Reserve action by the end of the
        year based on past timing, however there is no specific timeline mandated. We will keep you
        apprised of the situation and should we get advance notice of Fed approval, will seek to arrange
        an opportunity for you to make a statement in person.
