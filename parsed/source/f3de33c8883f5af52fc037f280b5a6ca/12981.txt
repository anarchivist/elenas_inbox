Dear [Brady Bill Supporter):

        Six years ago, you showed extraordinary political courage by
standing up to the gun lobby and voting for the Brady bill. That law has
helped to make America a safer place.

        Next week, you will have the opportunity to vote on one of the
most important pieces of gun legislation since the Brady bill.  I urge you
to stand up to the gun lobby once again, and support common sense measures
to close the gun show and other loopholes.

        Opponents of meaningful gun legislation are still making the same
false arguments you heard six years ago, that criminals donO,t buy guns
from gun dealers or at gun shows, and that any new gun law is just a plot
to take away gun owner sO, rights.

        Of course, all Americans now know the truth: since 1993, the Brady
Law has blocked well over a quarter of a million illegal handgun sales to
felons, fugitives, stalker, and other prohibited persons -- and no
law-abiding citizen has been stopped from buying a gun for sport or
self-protection.  In fact, the Brady Law has proven to be one of the most
effective law enforcement tools ever.

        Under pressure from the gun lobby, some in the House have proposed
gun show legislation that is riddled with new· and dangerous loopholes
similar to those that were defeated in the Senate.   I urge you to reject


that approach, and support the common sense measures enacted by the
Senate.

        Your vote on these important details can make the difference in
whether or not we close the gun show loophole once and for all.  For
instance, if the current House proposal to put a 72-hour time limit on
background checks at gun shows applied to the FBIO,s National Instant Check
System (NICS), the Justice Department estimates that 22 percent of the
fugitives and felons that have been denied guns -- or more than 9,300
over the past 6 months -- would have them today.  But that·is not all.
The House bill would also allow hundreds of guns to be sold at flea
markets without any background check, and it would prevent law enforcement
from tracing many of guns that are sold at gun shows and later used in
crimes.

        As a supporter of the Brady bill, you have a record of putting the
interests of the American people over the clout of the gun lobby.  In the
that same spirit, I ask you again to vote your convictions -- and vote
once again to keep guns out of the wrong hands.
