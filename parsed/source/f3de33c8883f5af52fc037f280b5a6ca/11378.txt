TEXT:
I (we) want to make sure that you two have signed off on everything we do
and leak. If you are not happy with the process I take that very seriously
and want to change how we do things to accomodate your directions.

I believe the best time to do this is at Lockhart's leak meeting. He had
one yesterday in which we discussed the W2W strategy and got sign-off from
everyone in the room. If you two are not in those meeting and can not
attend, do you want me to track back with you to discuss?

I need to let you know that our proposed press plan is done one week in
advance and is distributed to your folks.

None of this is to be competitive, it is just bad communication at this
point, which I have a great desire in straightening out.

You two have been wonderful to us and done a great deal of work on behalf
of the VP.  I honestly did not realize you all were not in the loop when I
write memos or attend meetings to discuss our proposed plans. If that is
not the case I will do whatever I can to help this process.

If you two would like I am more than happy to sit down with the two of you
once a week to discuss what we are planning on doing and the press
strtaegy around it.                                         .

Thank you for all your efforts and I apologize for anything I have done to
help confuse things.

Pat
