 I'll be out of the office on a long-delayed mini-vacation for the next few
 days.   I'll be gone from tomorrow morning through the end of the weekend,
 but can be paged through signal or reached in Los Angeles at                          71
C=e..QL(W!§J=:=J Tanya will be working on the NGA event, and she has all of    COU
 the information either of has related to that event.

When I had scheduled this a while back, I hadn't realized that the focus
of NGA was going to be on education.  So if you think it is a problem for
me to leave in the few days leading up to NGA, definitely let me know.
I'll come in for a bit later tomorrow morning, so you can e-mail me if you
think it's important for me to be around.  Otherwise, I'll be back on
Monday. - - Jon
