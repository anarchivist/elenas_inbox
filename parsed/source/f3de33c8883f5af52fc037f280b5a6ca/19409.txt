TEXT:
As most of you know, in this morning's senior staff meeting Podesta asked
our office to coordinate a presidential statement for the 30th anniversary
of the Fair Housing Act this Saturday (tell the kids to forget Passover
and Easter, it's FHA weekend).  There's not a whole lot of time between
now and then, so, if you've not done so already, could you please deploy
the considerable brain power of a crack NEC or DPC staffer to prepare a
draft that we could send around internally on, say, Thursday afternoon? P
lease let me know who'll be working on it.   Thanks.
