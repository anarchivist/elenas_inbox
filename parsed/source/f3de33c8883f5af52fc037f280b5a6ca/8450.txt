MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                       Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:               Analysis of Hatch-Feinstein Tobacco Bill


       The Hatch-Feinstein bill is based on the original agreement between the state attorneys
general and the tobacco companies, with a few changes (stronger lookback surcharges; tobacco
farmer provisions that are a hybrid of Ford and Lugar). While smaller than the McCain bill, the
Hatch bill includes a significant price increase (66 cents a pack from annual payments, another
25 cents a pack or more from lookbacks). The most important shortcoming of the Hatch bill is
its FDA provisions, which include several procedural hurdles leftover from the settlement.

        The public health community and many Democrats would also object to the absence of a
company-specific lookback surcharge, no federal enforcement of secondhand smoke restrictions,
and all the liability protections from the settlement (a $5.5 billion annual cap and a ban on class
actions and punitive damages). Nevertheless, Daschle and some other Senate Democrats have
not ruled out the possibility of negotiating with Hatch, since his bill may be the only
comprehensive vehicle that can pass this year. As usual, the major hurdle is how to secure a
bipartisan majority for some form ofliability protection, without which LoU (and Hatch) will
walk away.

  I. Summary of Hatch-Feinstein

       A. Overall Cost and Price Per Pack

        The charts Hatch distributed earlier this week dramatically exaggerated the cost of the
McCain bill. OMB and Treasury have done Administration estimates that correct these
problems by taking into account the volume adjustment in both bills, and measuring both in real
rather than nominal dollars.
                               McCain Mgrs Arndt.                    Hatch-Feinstein
                               (25-year cost in 1999$)               (25-year cost in 1999$)
Base Payment                          $408 billion                          $291 billion
Estimated Lookbacks                      59 billion                             80 billion
Total                                   467 billion                            371 billion

Youth Smoking Reduction in 10 years             %                                  42%

       B. Spending

        The attached OMB chart compares the available revenue and spending priorities in the
McCain and Hatch bills and the settlement. McCain raises $59 billion over 5 years; Hatch raises
$46 billion; the settlement raises $40 billion. The Hatch bill divides the money in almost
exactly the same way as the McCain managers amendment (i.e., before the tax cut and drug
amendments). The major potential difference is that the Hatch bill includes an offset for liability
payments that could reduce the available revenue by up to one-third if the companies are hit with
massive verdicts in court.

       C. Lookback Surcharges

        The Hatch bill includes industry-wide lookback surcharges that are dramatically larger
than those in the settlement. In the settlement, penalties were capped at $2 billion a year.
Hatch raised that cap to $5 billion in the first 5 years and $10 billion after that. The McCain
managers amendment capped industry-wide penalties at $4 billion non-deductible, or about $5.5
billion pre-tax. (The Durbin amendment cut that in half.) We estimated the maximum McCain
penalties at about 35 cents a pack; maximum Hatch penalties would be about 60 cents a pack.

       However, Hatch's penalty scheme inherits a few problems from the settlement. First,
companies can apply for an abatement of their share of the penalties, which the public health
community strongly objected to last summer. Second, Hatch includes a double-counting
adjustment to keep from penalizing companies more than once for the same teenage smoker.
This has the effect of reducing actual penalties by about two-thirds. Third, and most important
to congressional Democrats, Hatch does not include any company-specific lookback penalty.
(The McCain managers amendment penalized companies $1,000 per youth smoker.)

      Even with these shortcomings, the Hatch lookbacks would raise $80 billion over 25 years,
compared to $59 billion in the McCain managers amendment. The Durbin lookback
amendment would raise $94 billion over 25 years, most of it in company-specific penalties.

       D. FDA

       E. Farmers

        The Hatch bill tries to strike a middle ground between Ford's bill and Lugar's 3-year
buyout. Hatch provides about $17 billion to end the tobacco program over 7 years, not 3, and
incorporates some ofFord's economic development provisions. Ford has said he might be
willing to end the program over 10-15 years, if states had the option to run their own support
programs. The current Hatch provisions are closer to Lugar than Ford, but Hatch has said he is
willing to make additional changes to pick up support.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
       F. Other provisions (state menu, ETS, etc.)

II. Legislative Options

Dems divided on strategy. A few on the left, like Kennedy, want to take the issue to the fall
elections. A few on the right, like Breaux, would take the Hatch bill as written. Otners, like
Kerry, Conrad, and Daschle, would like to keep working to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate,
but need direction from us on how to do so. Kerry seems to prefer a streamlined McCain bill,
still with $1.10 but with fewer titles and less spending. He is willing to talk to Lott and to
Hatch, but doesn't like the Hatch bill. Conrad is willing to talk to Hatch, but would prefer a
smaller bill (in the 65-cent-a-pack range) with no liability caps.

McCain, meanwhile, is willing to do whatever Lott asks, but won't negotiate with anybody on a
new bill until Lott guarantees him 60 votes for cloture. He believes that will only happen if
Republicans tell Lott they felt a lot of heat over the recess.

Starting point of any strategy is to pressure Republicans as much as possible over the recess.
Matt's FEe complaint. Scruggs' ad. Energizing groups to apply heat. But groups are
demoralized and weak.

We have two options: encourage Dems to unite behind some position along the lines of what
Kerry has suggested, where they try to make R's look bad and show we don't really care about
the money. This is unlikely to lead anywhere, but could keep the issue alive for the fall.
However, Republicans have other ways to get clean on tobacco, either by attaching a skinny but
otherwise unobjectionable youth smoking bill as a rider to an appropriations bill or by passing a
reconciliation bill that includes a significant tobacco tax increase to pay for tax cuts, which we
might be forced to veto for other reasons.

Our other option is to find some way to engage Hatch, either directly or through Kerry, Daschle,
and/or McCain. (Or: Go directly to Lott and Daschle, say this is too important, force them to
work things out.)
