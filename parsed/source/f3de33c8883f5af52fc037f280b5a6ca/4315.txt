TEXT:
NGA is doing an all day tobacco meeting on Wednesday witn lots of state
folks (govs offices. health depts. AG's office). They've invited the
White House to speak. I think it would be in our interest to be there.
Bruce agrees. although he finds it too painful to do himself. We elected
you. Any chance?
