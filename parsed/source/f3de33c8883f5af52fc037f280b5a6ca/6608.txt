TEXT:
Gene last night asked me to look up five cases for him to review. He is
speaking at the Leadership Conference on civil Rights. specifically on
Higher Education and Higher Education Finance.

Gene suggested that I check with you to see if you have the cases he is
specifically looking for.

1.         Aderand (96?) Supreme Court
2.         Croson (89?) Supreme Court
3.         Hopwood (96-97?) 5th Circuit Court
4.         Wygant vs. Jackson Board of Education (86) Supreme Court
5.         MI Affirmative Action

If you have any of these please let me know and I will stop by. make
copies and pick them up.

Thanks.
