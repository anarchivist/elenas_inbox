Subject:         wellstone Amendment update

Nothing is resolved. However, at a meeting this afternoon, the lead
non-W&M conferees sounded as if they expect the conference to wind up late
this week without ANY amendment to the welfare law.  W&M conferees are
firm, and Senate conferees are arguing to Wellstone that an HEA bill is
not an appropriate place to press for a welfare change.
