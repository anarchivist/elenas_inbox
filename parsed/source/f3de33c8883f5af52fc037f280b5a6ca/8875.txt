POSSIBLE STATEMENT REGARDING HEFLEY AMENDMENT
IN THE EVENT OF AN ADVERSE RESULT

        Today, the Republican House of Representatives voted to overturn
Executive Order 13087. The Order provides a uniform policy for the
Federal Government to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation
in the federal civilian workforce.

        I am deeply disappointed that the House of Representatives has
taken action that legitimizes government sponsored discrimination against
its own citizens based on their sexual orientation.   The American people
believe in fairness, not discrimination, and I am confident they will
reject this unseemly and unjust action by the House.

        It has always been the practice of this Administration to
prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the
federal civilian workforce.  Most federal agencies and department have
taken actions to memorialize that policy.   The Executive Order does no
more than make that policy uniform across the federal government.  It does
not authorize affirmative action, or preferences, or special rights for
anyone.

        The Executive Order reflects this AdministrationD,s firm
commitment that the federal government make employment related decisions
in the civilian workforce based on individual ability and not on sexual
orientation.  I assure each and every American that the Republicans in
Congress cannot and will not force this Administration to discriminate.
