TEXT:
By COB Friday, you will have on your chair in rm 222 a copy of the section
by section comments and proposed revisions on McCain that we have gotten
from the agencies.

You have a choice:

1)   You may wish,to review these materials.   Some comments are quite
'detailed, and many, represent new work (i.e., DOJ on consent decrees).
Since the comments are in the order of the bill sections, you may wish to
have your copy of the bill there to consult.

or

2) You may want to skip this review, and look at a) the copy of S. 1415
once we've marked it up and/or b) the memo we will write summarying these
suggestions.
