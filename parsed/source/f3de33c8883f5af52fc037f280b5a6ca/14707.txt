        The following are some questions and answers on the legal limits of White House
outreach on welfare to work. The first set of questions deal with our relationships with a
SOI(c)(3) organization incorporated to assist businesses and other entities with welfare to work
programs. The second set deal with our use of particular individuals in carrying welfare to work
outreach to religious organizations and non-profits. The answers to these questions are based
upon the Standards of Ethical Conduct of Government Employees and other applicable
regulations and statutes.


A. Relationship with a particular SOl(c)(3).

1. Can we refer businesses and other entities interested in hiring or training welfare recipients to
an existing SOl (c)(3) for information and direction?

Yes, provided we act evenhandedly ifthere is more than one SOI(c)(3) organization offering
similar assistance. Ifwe are not aware of any competing SOI(c)(3)s, there is no problem in
referring interested parties to one entity.

2. Can we invite representatives of a SOI(c)(3) to meetings on welfare to work implementation
strategy -- including meetings with the NGA or other similar groups?

Yes, subject to the requirements of even-handedness noted above and provided we do not
disclose to them any confidential (non-public) information.

3. Is there a problem in attending meetings held by groups such as the NGA if included in those
meetings are representatives from· a SOl (c)(3)?

No. However, if another SOl (c)(3) requests a meeting separately from the one called by the
NGA, we must be prepared to meet with them on a similar basis.

4. Can we direct the SOI(c)(3) to engage in a particular action or follow a particular strategy?

No. The White House may not direct a private entity to take a particular action or course of
action nor we selectively decide which private entities receive public information. We can,
however, provide publicly available infopnation to the private entity(ies) and indicate what
strategies we feel are the most effective.

S. Can we create our own non-profit to perform welfare to work outreach to religious
organizations or to other non-profits?

No. The general rule is that we cannot create non-profits to effectuate government policy.
We are currently looking into whether some limited exception to this rule is possible.

B. Use of individuals for outreach.

1. Can we ask individuals to volunteer to work with religious organizations and non-profits in
helping them with welfare to work?

This is a difficult issue. There is no problem in discussing issues with private individuals and
indicating that we would like them to work on particular matters. However, we cannot direct a
private person's activity and we must be careful to not give that person the impression that she
holds an official position or that her activities are government sanctioned. That individual, in
tum, must be take care in dealings with third parties not to convey the impression that she is
acting on behalf of the White House or thai her actions have been officially sanctioned.

2. Can we announce that a particular private person is the point person for the White House for
outreach to religious organizations and non-profits?

No. We can mention the efforts of persons of which we have knowledge; but ifmore than one
person is engaged in similar activities, we may need to be inclusive to avoid the appearance of
favoritism. If we want a person to have a specific and ongoing role, we may have to make that
person an employee or provide that person with another form of formal status.

3. Can we direct a private individual to engage in specific actions or employ a particular strategy
in welfare to work outreach?

Not unless that person assumes an official position in the Administration.
