TEXT:
         Those who say they can do nothing about this are wrong.  By
changing the way they do business.    . by making programs, CDs, and video
games as if their own children were watching . . . members of the
entertainment community can make a big difference.   Today, I am issuing a
challenge to the entire entertainment industry -- to stop showing guns in
any ads and previews children might see.   Secon~, I challenge theater
owners across America to enforce more strictly the age requirements on the
movies they show. No theater owner should turn the other way as a child
walks unchaperoned into an R-rated movie.   And third, I challenge the
movie industry to re-evaluate its ratings system -- specifically, the
PG-13 rating, to determine whether it is allowing gratuitous violence in
movies viewed by children. Our administration is fighting to do
everything we can to protect our children.   The entertainment industry
should do the same.
