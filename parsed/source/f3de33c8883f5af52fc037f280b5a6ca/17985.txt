RE:            CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE

DATE:          DECEMBER 4, 1997

Summary:
         The goal of this initiative is to improve the handling of federal discrimination cases so
that citizens' complaints are heard more promptly and with less paperwork, and to reform federal
civil rights offices so they are more effective at prevention and are better coordinated. The plan
was developed in meetings with leaders of federal civil rights offices and with input from
representatives ofleading civil rights organizations and offices within the Administration
including the White House Counsel, OPL, PIR, NEC, and OMB.

         Among the highlights of the initiative is its commitment to modernize and reform the
Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission. The initiative outlines investments in EEOC
technology and programs so that by the year 2000 the average EEOC case will be heard within 6
months.' In addition, the plan puts in place, for the first time, a comprehensive strategy across
the six leading civil rights agencies (the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the
Department of Justice, the Department of Labor's Office of Civil Rights, the Department of
Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Housing and Urban Development, and
the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Civil Rights) to make it easier to
comply with federal laws and more difficult to discriminate. Each agency will expand the use of
alternative dispute resolution techniques, improve data collection and technical assistance to
business, participate in a $15 million technology upgrade to reduce paperwork, and share
expertise as part of a coordinated federal civil rights working group. The package of
improvements totals approximately $78 million, including a 12.5% increase above the enacted
FY 1998 budget for EEOC, and a roughly 50% increase for the relevant HUD office. [Note:
OMB has so far approved only $57 million worth of new expenditures. An attached memo
lists the $21 million in new, as yet unapproved, spending.]




I.     Reducing Backlogs

        One of the most commented upon problems in civil rights enforcement is delay in hearing
cases at the EEOC. Although substantial progress has been made in reducing EEOC delays, this
plan uses improvements in technology and a $8 million infusion of resources to lower the
average time it takes to resolve private-sector complaints to 6 months by the year 2000. The
plan also includes two new initiatives at HHS to reduce backlogs by expanding the use of teams
                                                                                Hex·Dump Conversion ·

 of investigators to provide case management and by contracting with state and local civil rights
 agencies to give states an active role in enforcement. These initiatives will also help to reduce
 increased workloads resulting from the Patients' Bill of Rights and Adoption 2002 initiatives.



 II.     Alternate Dispute Resolution

         The plan calls for the introduction and expansion of Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)
 across all relevant agencies. The largest initial investment is a $4 million expansion of the
 EEOC's mediation program for FY 1999 so that the EEOC will be able to mediate 10 percent of
 its 80,000 new charges. In addition, pilot programs will be introduced at several agencies
 including a program developed by HHS for 10 urban and rural areas, and a program run by Labor
 to assist states in developing ADR.


 III.   Improving Compliance, Data Collection and Technical Assistance Efforts

           The initiative includes a fund to improve the surveying, technical outreach, and
 compliance efforts by lead civil rights offices. The largest measure is a $10 million program
 run by HUD to conduct targeted, audit-based enforcement using paired testers, piloted in
 several metropolitan areas, designed to raise awareness of the extent of discrimination
 through focused and publicly released audit results and subsequent enforcement action.
 The Department of Education will undertake a $1.7 million survey of the 15,000 school districts
 across the country to determine the demographics of the elementary and secondary schools in the
 districts for both teachers and students. This survey will be used by Education and other
 agencies to target and assist in future technical assistance, compliance, and litigation efforts.
 Other projects include EEOC's efforts to improve compliance through videos for employers
 and a public service campaign, and a $1.5 million initiative by the DOL's Office of Federal
 Contract Compliance for technical assistance that focuses on prevention rather than enforcement.
  The Department of Labor will begin a comprehensive compliance monitoring program allowing
 it to triple the number of compliance reviews it conducts a year and reform the system by which
 it chooses targets for its reviews. HHS will use the funds to investigate medical
 decision-making to determine how it is influenced by race and ethnicity.



 IV.    Improving Technology

          The plan includes a $15 million technology initiative for EEOC, HHS, Labor, and
  Education to provide for communication via electronic mail; eliminate redundant data entry
  procedures; permit the sharing of information and enhanced research capabilities for
  investigators and attorneys; allow for the filing of forms and complaints over the Internet, and
. provide for the sharing of civil righ~s data bases.
v.     Coordination Among Civil Rights Agencies                            Nex·Dump Conversion

         A common complaint by groups who work with federal civil rights offices is the lack of
coordination among Administration efforts. This initiative will institute a standing inter-agency
group to address cross-cutting issues including broad strategic planning, and development of
performance outcome measures, training initiatives and data collections. In addition, the plan
recommends that the President call upon each Department to establish an internal high-level
civil rights advisory council to agency-wide policies and practices and serve as a forum for
external organizations to present civil rights concerns associated with individual agency
programs.
                                                                      Automated Records iVianClgement SYstem

RE:            CIVIL RIGHTS CROSSCUT

DATE:          DECEMBER 2,1997

        Below is a list of perfonnance goals that are applicable across agencies and suggestions
as to how they might be implemented at the various civil rights enforcement agencies.

I.     ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

A.     EEOC

·      Mediation Program. EEOC proposes to mediate approximately 8,000, or 10 percent of
       the 80,000 new charges expected in FY 1999. ($4,000,000)(OMB approved)

B.     HHS-OCR

·      Mediation Partnerships: HHS would contract with providers of mediation services in five
       to ten pilot urban and rural areas. OCR would decentralize the use of third party
       mediation services for a subset of complaints assessed through its case triage process.
       ($250,000) (new)

C.     DOL-OCR

·      Mediation. 7 FTE will be required to market ADR and to assist states in developing and
       designing ADR programs. In addition, 4 FTE will be needed to provide ADR for those
       complainants who request ADR in the processing of their complaints. ($990,000) (new)

D.     DOL-OFCCP

·      Alternate Dispute Resolution. OFCCP is initiating an alternate dispute resolution
       program in order to facilitate the closure of compliance reviews and complaint
       investigations. ADR will be used as an effort to avoid litigation and to reduce the
       number of cases referred to the Solicitor of Labor for enforcement. ($203,000) (new)

E.     EDUCATION

·      Alternate Dispute Resolution. In December 1993, OCR issued a new Case Resolution

                                                I
                                                                             Hex-Dump Convt:rsion
      Manual (CRM). The CRM streamlined the complaint resolution process so that OCR
      can provide mqre efficient and effective service to complainants. One element of the
      CRM is an alternative dispute resolution procedure (ADR). Any additional funding over
      OCR's FY 1999 appropriation could be used to provide additional staff training to build
      skills necessary for effective ADR or to hire contract mediators to actually facilitate
      resolution between the parties. ($100,000) (new)

II.   TARGETING FUTURE COMPLIANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
      EFFORTS (through data collection and other means)

A.    EEOC

·     Benchmark EEO survey data. EEOC would like to perform a one-time data collection
      from employers to obtain benchmark EEO survey data for the Americans with
      Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. ($250,000) (new)

·     Video Outreach and Technical Assistance. Three video productions on subjects such as
      "Information for Small Employers," "Mediation to Resolve Charges," and "Best Practices
      for Employers." ($225,000) (new)

·     PSA Campaign. ($100,000) (new)

·     Stakeholder Meetings. Stakeholder meetings around the country for 25 offices.
      ($125,000) (new)

·     Translation of materials. Translate pamphlets into several languages, including
      production costs. ($280,000) (new)

B.    EDUCATION

·     Elementary and Secondary School Civil Rights Compliance Report: OCR would conduct
      a survey of the approximately 15,000 school districts in the country on the following:
      number and types of schools within a school district; the demographics of the school
      district for both teachers and students; the number of students by race and gender in gifted
      and talented programs;; the number of students with disabilities by race and gender; and
      the number of students in math, science, and computer programs by race and gender.
      This data is used by other government agencies, including DOl in its enforcement
      activities for approximately 400 court-ordered school districts. In addition, information
      and data obtained by the survey would be used as a baseline for OCR's proposed
      activities under GPRA. ($1,700,000) (new)

C.    HHS-OCR



                                               2
                                                                         Hex-Dump COilv~;"Sion
·   Testing Program - Nursing Home Assistance and Program Abuse. OCR proposes
    establishing a new program to broaden the use of testing in the nursing home sector to
    uncover discriminatory practices. Consumer education and outreach will be targeted
    toward informing racial minorities and disability communities about discriminatory and
    abusive admissions and marketing practices so that they can report questionable practices
    to OCR and to the HHS Inspector General, DOl. ($2,600,000) (new)

·   Analysis of Differential Treatment Modalities. OCR, working with the HHS Data
    Council, would investigate medical decision-making at the individual facility level to see
    how it is influenced by race and ethnicity. OCR would contract for the development of
    methodologies to determine potential areas of discrimination or differential access to
    services through assessment of Departmental and State level administrative data sets.
    The purpose of this initiative is to identify potentially non-complying hospitals and to
    target and implement Title VI compliance reviews and outreach initiatives. As the result
    of this effort, HHS expects to change the compliance status of from 220 to 280 facilities.
    IfHHS were to undertake all such reviews over a three-year period, it would need
    approximately $565,000 per year, beyond an initial $500,000 for survey design and
    analysis, to support the staffing needed to carry out such reviews while simultaneously
    avoiding an accumulation ofa backlog. ($1,065,000) (new)

·   Managed Care. OCR's FY 1999 budget request seeks consultant services to develop
    data collection measuring the effect of managed care arrangements on Hill-Burton
    facilities and others. The purpose of this initiative is to target compliance reviews and
    outreach activities in support of both the President's Initiative on Race and to ensure
    effective oversight of the nondiscrimination provisions of the Patients' Bill of Rights
    endorsed by the President on November 19. HHS expects that these reviews of managed
    care plans and other insurance arrangements will require 50 percent more time than
    individual facility reviews. Accordingly, HHS estimates that it would need
    approximately $300,000 per year, beyond an initial $250,000 for survey design and
    analysis, to support the staffing needed to carry out 50 such reviews per year. ($550,000)
    (new)

·   Outcome Measurement. OCR is moving from output and process measures to assessing
    the extent to which the number and quality of services to protected classes has changed.
    The purpose of this initiative is: (1) to collect data on program performance that focuses
    on the public's ability to access and benefit from HHS services and (2) to focus
    performance goals and reporting on outcome measures identified in the Annual
    Govemment Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Plan. By collecting outcome data
    focusing on service to individuals, OCR will be able to effectively target activities based
    on which compliance strategies result in the greatest number of additional minority
    persons served by programs, the greatest number of additional services, or changes in the
    quality of services provided. ($250,000)(new)                                   .

D.   DOL-OCR
·    Improved Targeting. An enhanced management information system could produce
     reports that would identify problem areas that should be targeted for review. This system
     could also identify trends in complaints so that compliance activities could be directed
     towards those entities most in need of assistance. This would maximize the utilization of
     staff resources to address the targeted problem areas in a given year and enhance
     development of work plans and results under GPRA. Approximately $100,000 is needed
     to design management information reports to meet this performance goal. ($100,000)
     (new)

·    Compliance Activities. 18 FTE will be required to provided total compliance
     monitoring coverage on a three-year cycle. Within existing resources, only 4 compliance
     reviews can now be conducted, due to the regulatory need to process complaints. This
     will enable staff to conduct 18 reviews per year. ($1,620,000) (new)

·    Data Collection on JTP A. Currently, applicant data is not captured to identify those
     seeking entry into programs such as JTP A. To ensure that discriminatory factors are not
     being used in the intake process, a pilot program could be instituted. This would require
     revisions to ETA's management information system, agreement by the pilot state to
     participate, and OMB concurrence to collect this data. ($360,000) (new)

·    Compliance Assistance. 3 FTE will be required to conduct 20 technical assistance visits
     per year. This represents staff being on travel two weeks out of every month.
     ($270,000)(new)

E.   DOL-OFCCP

·    Future Targeting. The OFCCP's three-pronged Fair Enforcement Strategy includes a
     comprehensive regulatory reform component. One aspect of the regulatory reform effort
     is the redesign of the compliance review process. This process, as restyled "compliance
     evaluations," will enable the OFCCP to institute a multi-tiered level of review, varying
     from limited "compliance checks" to the full-scope compliance review. Additional
     resources for the three-pronged strategy will allow OFCCP to revise the requirements for
     the Affirmative Action Plan, fully implement the Affirmative Action Program Summary
     Report, and enhance the tiered compliance review enforcement strategy. ($4,800,000)
     (OMB approved)

·    Ombud Activities. OFCCP will increase the use of its Ombud Office to improve
     customer quality and service. The Ombud Office, established in 1995, provides
     customer service, technical assistance, and a means for OFCCP's stakeholders to obtain
     confidential advice regarding the laws, policies, and programs that are administered by
     the OFCCP. Through this expansion of the Ombud Office, OFCCP will provide
     technical assistance earlier with the result of reducing the amount of resources needed

       during full compliance reviews performed at a later time. ($1,700,000) (new)
F.     HUD

·      Targeted, audit-based enforcement initiative. HUD will receive $10 million for a
       targeted, audit-based enforcement initiative, piloted in several metropolitan areas, that
       would raise awareness of the extent of discrimination through focused and publicly
       released audit results and subsequent enforcement action. An audit-based enforcement
       initiative using paired testers could be piloted in 20 metropolitan areas around the
       country. $5 million would provide each of the 20 non-profit organizations with $250,000
       to establish an organizational capacity to administer paired testing in the rental and sales
       markets, develop comparable indices of discrimination, and provide for analysis and
       public dissemination of audit results. An additional $5 million would provide the 20
       metropolitan areas with sufficient funds to conduct audits using 500 pairs of testers.

·      Inventorv Reduction. To reduce the private-sector backlog from the current over 9.4
       months it takes to resolve private sector complaints to 6 months by the year 2000, EEOC
       requires 165 new FTEs. ($8,000,000) (OMB approved)

B.     HHS-OCR

·      Changes in Complaint Processing to Respond to Additional Workload. OCR proposes
       expanding its pilot program which uses teams of investigators to review incoming cases
       and to provide ongoing case management. This expansion will require additional team
       training. OCR also anticipates increased complaint workload resulting from the
       Patients' Bill of Rights and the Adoption 2002 initiatives. OCR estimates that $360,000
       would be needed both to continue to enhance expedited complaint processing and to
       prevent development of a backlog. ($400,000) (new)

·      State and Local Program. OCR's Strategic Plan proposes to increase partnerships with
       state and local agencies to expand the scope of civil rights compliance coverage of HHS
       grantees. OCR proposes a pilot program to contract with states and local civil rights
       agencies to conduct investigations, thus expanding its capacity to enforce civil rights
       while giving states an active role in enforcement. The purpose of these partnerships is to
       enhance the ability to target OCR staff resources on precedent-setting and high priority
       complaint investigations while continuing to improve response times to citizen
       complaints. ($500,000) (new)

IV.   PAPERLESS OFFICE
A.    EEOC

·     Infonnation Systems. The EEOC has proposed a three-year $25 million initiative to
      upgrade hardware, communications infrastructure, and the deployment of integrated
      infonnation systems throughout the agency. The FY 1999 request of $1 0 million would
      provide a basic communication infrastructure that would allow the EEOC to complete the
      development and procurement of new infonnation systems capabilities. These upgrades
      will allow the field offices and headquarters to communicate via electronic mail,
      eliminate redundant data entry procedures, and provide for greater operational efficiency
      through the sharing of infonnation and enhanced research capabilities for investigators
      and attorneys. ($10,000,000) (OMB approved)

·     Replacing Paper Fonns. The EEOC proposes developing an "Interactive Diskette" data
      collection to replace "Paper Fonns" for all EEOC employment survey data collection
      programs. ($200,000) (new)

B.     HHS-OCR

·     Civil Rights on the Internet: New technology that would allow the public to file
      complaints via computer. Also technical assistance to grantees could be accomplished
      via the Internet. Survey data collections, pre-grant certifications, investigative data
      requests and responses could also be expedited. ($250,000) (new)

C.    ALL CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES (Justice, Labor, HHS,
      Education, and EEOC)

·     Linked Civil Rights Data Bases: This linking of all the data bases would pennit the
      agencies to share statistics that each agency collects. Linking technology would also
      improve coordination among the civil rights agencies. ($500,000)(new)

D.    DOL-OCR

·     Technology Improvements: There is a need for the establishment of a data base that can
      provide management infonnation reports that can respond to GPRA and DOJ
      requirements. A review is required of the current infonnation technology infrastructure
      that supports the civil rights enforcement of federal financial assistance programs to
      detennine what is needed to achieve the desired outcomes of improved case processing
      and case management. A working group could be established to conduct the survey and
      make recommendations in this area. Some economies of scale could be achieved if
      agencies explored the possibility of selecting a data base system that would meet the
      needs of agencies with some modifications adaptable to their specific programs.

E.   DOL-OFCCP

·    Infonnation Technology: These funds will be used to upgrade the agency's infrastructure
     and replace outmoded systems hardware, enabling OFCCP to meet its current
     requirements and to develop the systems necessary for federal contractors to submit data
     electronically to the program. The agency will also provide the technology necessary for
     compliance officers to record all documents related to reviews electronically.
     ($4,000,000) (new)

V.   COORDINATION AMONG CIVIL RIGHTS AGENCIES

A.   Proposed by HHS-OCR

·    Inter-agency Civil Rights Coordination Group: A standing inter-agency group composed
     of principals or their deputies would address cross-cutting issues induding broad strategic
     planning, coordination of litigation strategie~, development of perfonnance outcome
     measures, outreach and partnership strategies, coordinated public service announcement
     and public relations initiatives, coordinated town meetings on civil rights issues,
     coordinated training initiatives, data collections, reviews, and investigations.

·    Inter-agency training program. A coordinated training strategy could entail creation of
     an inter-agency training program. The training program could be under the auspices of
     the Department of Justice. It would focus on investigative methodologies, examination
     of best practices in non-discriminatory service delivery, litigation review and strategy,
     data collection techniques and other compliance techniques that can be employed by
     many agencies, including HHS, ED, HUD, DOL, DOT, and EEOC. The center could
     also provide civil rights investigative and outreach training to state and local partners. A
     training center with dedicated staff could either be contracted or use federal agency staff.
     A rough estimate of the cost for rent, staff support, curriculum development, scholarships
     for non-federal participants, equipment, trainers, etc. is $1,000,000 government-wide per
     year. ($1,000,000) (new)

·    Intra-agency civil rights councils. These councils would be a means for furthering civil
     rights compliance throughout individual departments and agencies. Each Department
     would establish a high-level body that would be advisory to the Secretaries or Agency
     Heads on civil rights issues. A Civil Rights Council would be a forum for review of
     agency-wide policies and practices and could serve as a forum for external organizations
     to present civil rights concerns associated with individual agency programs. Such a
     council would be headed by the Department or Agency's chief Civil Rights Official and
     would require minimal staffing (an Executive Secretary to the Council and perhaps one
     support staff) in addition to staff that could be provided from within the agencies.

     ($200,000) (new)                                                     Ht:x·LJ.jln~ Coml",Jion


·    Geo-codedlMapping Data Base on a Civil Rights Intranet. OCR proposes development,
     in conjunction with the Census Bureau and the Department of Justice, of a
     government-wide pilot project that would make geo-coded mapping of race, ethnicity,
     imd national origin Census data available to all civil rights agencies on a Civil Rights
     Intranet. This resource would enable civil rights agencies to have immediate access to
     tract level data during the course of investigations and reviews. Other uses of this
     system could inciude a government-wide index of administrative decisions, letters of
     findings, and entities under civil rights investigation. ($350,000) (new)

B.   Proposed by DOL-OCR

·    Coordination between DOJ and OMB. In order to achieve enhanced civil rights
     enforcement, OMB will be required to review the civil rights enforcement function on a
     cross-cutting basis to achieve performance goals. DO] could work with OMB and the
     respective agencies to promote a comprehensive civil rights agenda. This would provide
     the framework and overall reporting relationships to integrate civil rights enforcement
     within the budget process. ($90,000) (new)

C.   Proposed by DOL-OFCCP

·    The Civil Rights Working Group, made up of all the civil rights agencies in the Federal
     government and a liaison from the White House, should be formalized and meet on a
     regular basis to integrate efforts to achieve civil rights in America.

·    Coordination with DO] and Veterans Affairs. Increase compliance on national origin
     discrimination and to share a database with Veterans Affairs so that veterans have equal
     employment opportunities. ($400,000) (new)

D.   Proposed by ED-OCR

·    Intranet technology. Civil rights enforcement agencies need to improve their
     communication network. Intranet technology could be used to create a network for used
     by selected civil rights enforcment agencies. The system could be used for various
     purposes such as sharing data; posting information like current research, historical
     document, special alerts, best practices, scheduled meetings/conferences, newsworthy
     events, and training opportunities. The system could also be used to communicate
     essential information and materials to agencies' staff on Presidential initiatives.
     ($100,000 to 500,000) (new)
