FROM MINYON & ANN:

We will hold a follow-up meeting in Ann's office regarding the upcoming
town hall meeting on Monday November 24th at 11:00 a.m.    If you can't
attend, please send a representative.    We might need to move locations,
so please be on alert for an e-mail or page from Ruby.
Also, due to the holidays, we will meet daily and a time will be set for
Tuesday and Wednesday during our meeting on Monday.

For lack of better words, those individuals who have taken the lead on
certain areas should come prepared to report on their progress.

Special thanks to everyone who worked to bring closure to a number of
issues that will be reported on in Monday's meeting.



p.s. if anyone was left off us this e-mail that should be included, please
advise Ruby asap!
