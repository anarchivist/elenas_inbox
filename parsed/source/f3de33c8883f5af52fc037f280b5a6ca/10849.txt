TEXT:
I understand that in yesterday's message meeting it was decided that we
would do an Education Event in Boston on February 2nd. Mayor Menino's
office has been sending people ideas of what he would like to do on
education, and I will get you all copies of their suggestions. Do we have
a sense of what we want to do? Advance teams will leave next Tuesday, so
I would like to be able to give the scheduler a sense on Monday of what
our specific message is, so they can start looking for good sites.

I'll drop-off the Menino stuff, and look forward to hearing back soon.
Thanks!
