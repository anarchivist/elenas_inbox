TEXT:
The farm groups say (Judge) Carlton had a conference call with them at 11
today.   He said that on Monday they will identify a trust fund for
farmers.   States that grow tobacco and sign on to the agreement will be
able to appoint trustees to divy up the funds.   Govenors of the growing
states that sign on wll do the appointing.   Both NC and KY are expected to
sign on (I guess NC's Easley did his press conference at 2 today).    The
farmers think the size of the trust find is yet to be determined, but will
not be a subset of the overall agreement.   Each state will get money based
on how much tobacco it grows.   McConnell and Bunning offices called KY
growers group today to say they would be fighting to keep the tobacco
program. Carlton asked the farmers to help fight the coming "Clinton
tax."    The NC farmers sounded more suspicious of things than KY.  It may
be too early to confirm this, they will all get a feel from their
constitutents.
