                                 SSA Report on Children's SSI

Overall, SSA concludes that the organization did a good job in redetennining eligibility for
children. However, the report identified three areas of concern, described further below.

As a result ofthis review, SSA will review the cases of 70,000 children terminated from the
program, out of a total of 136,000 terminations to date. In addition, SSA will offer all of the
75,000 families who didn't appeal or request continuation of benefits during an appeal a new
opportunity to do so. Overall, SSA projects that 102,000 children will ultimately lose SSI after
all appeals are completed, compared to its prior projection of 135,000. This drop of33,000 is
caused by the actions in this report (10,000 cases) and a reestimate of the baseline (23,000 cases.)

I. Mental Retardation
Advocates' concern: Too many children with mental retardation were cut from the rolls.

SSA Finding: Of the 136,000 children tenninated to date, 42,000 had a diagnosis of mental
retardation (MR). However, most of these children do not actually have MR, because until
recently SSA's systems did not have all the proper codes. Instead, most of these children have
other mental disorders or "~orderline intellectual functioning," which falls short of full-fledged
MR. However, some unknown subset of the 42,000 do have MR, but their impainnents are not
severe enough to qualify them for SSI.

SSA also found that 8% ofthe 42,000 cases (3,400 children) were either decided wrong, or the
file lacked required documentation.

Even with these tenninations, about 360,000 children with MR will remain on the rolls, out of a
total of one million children on SSI.

SSA Action: SSA will review all cases terminated that had a diagnosis ofMR, to ensure that all
those decisions were made properly.

II. State Variations in Cutoffs
Advocates' Concern: Errors in cutoffs appear likely, since termination rates varied widely by
state, from 32% in Nevada to 82% in Mississippi. Also, SSA may not have acquired all
documentation, such as school records, needed to judge a child's disability. Finally, some states
were disqualifying too many families for failure to cooperate without making adequate efforts to
reach them.

SSA Findings: SSA data show that on average 93% oftennination decisions were both
accurate and complete in terms of including all required documentation. This exceeds SSA's
required level of state perfonnance for SSI. However, 10 states had accuracy/completion rates
below 90%. Another 9 states had accuracy/completion rates below the national average.
(SSA's experience is that about one-third of the errors identified in these measures will
ultimately prove to be accurate decisions that simply lacked documentation.) SSA found that
many inaccurate decisions stem from an overly strict interpretation of the new rules for children
who exhibit maladaptive behavior.
                                                                               Hex·Dump Conversion


Advocates' claims that SSA did not acquire all needed documentation was determined to be
unfounded. However, SSA found wide state variation in the rate of cutoffs due to failure to
cooperate and that, in the four states with the highest rates, 68% of the cases did not include
documentation that all required efforts to contact the family had been made.

SSA then performed a regression analysis intended to determine whether wide state to state
variations should be expected, based on factors such as the child's age and impairment and
whether the child was initially added to the rolls based on the less strict criteria that the welfare
law eliminated. SSA found that these factors would lead you to expect the cutoff rate to vary
from 48% in Montana to 66% in Hawaii. While this regression analysis does not fully explain
the actual state-by-state variance, SSA believes that the actions it is taking as a result of this
report will ensure that variances are not due to errors.

SSA Action: For states with accuracy/completion rates below 90%, SSA will review all cases.
For states with accuracy/completion rates between 90% and 93%, SSA will review a sample of
cases to see if additional reviews are needed. SSA will also provide more training on
maladaptive behavior. In all states with a failure to cooperate rates above the national average,
SSA will review the cases of all where the family did not appeal the decision.

III. Appeal Rights
Advocates' concern: Too few families are appealing, because SSA's notice to families was
confusing, and workers discouraged appeals. Also, SSA discouraged families from requesting
that benefits be continued during the appeal.

SSA Finding: SSA believes that their workers did not discourage appeals, but a poll conducted
by SSA confirms that many families did not understand their appeal rights.

SSA Action: All families of children who were terminated and did not appeal will be given a
new opportunity to do so. All families of children who appealed but did not request
continuation of benefits during the appeal will also be given a new opportunity to make that
request. SSA will also publicize the availability of free legal services for families.
