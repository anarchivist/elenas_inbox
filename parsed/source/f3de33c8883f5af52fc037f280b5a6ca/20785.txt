TEXT:
Don Lubick & co. just called.

1. On Arnold & Porter, they say we should wait until Monday to have the
meeting. They say the key A&P guy is in Europe, and that having the
meeting tomorrow would be counterproductive -- the unions would feel like
they were doing an end run around their smartest guy on this issue when an
extra day would allow him to be there and articulate their best
arguments.  I told them that, if our goal is to have this released
Tuesday, a meeting on Monday would lessen the value of the meeting because
the unions would know that the meeting couldn't possibly have any
influence on the notice. They, of course, didn't seem to mind that.

This raises the question of whether we really want to or need to -- or can
-- have this out on Tuesday, because of whatever Governors event is
happening that day.  Since the Marvin language controversy is not yet
resolved, I'm not sure Tuesday is realistic from that angle anyway.

What do you think?   Should we absolutely insist on tomorrow, or tell them
Monday is OK?

2. They say they haven't circulated anything new to Marvin/DOL.   Someone
may have sent them a copy of the full notice, but they say it would have
been the most recent version.
