TEXT:
Our communications giants woke up this morning and decided they wanted to
do the radio address on flood relief after all, despite Hilley and my
objections.  I told Margie at HUD -- they had stayed up all night getting
it ready.

We need to fight hard to get it on the schedule for next week's radio
address, or for an actual event in the next two weeks.  (June 7-14 is
Homeownership week.)

I found this after I wrote my voucher piece for the weekly. It is more
detailed than what I wrote, but mine is basically consistent with this.
If you decide you want to add more, you can cut and paste from this.

Subject:         Education amendment

The education amendment adopted in the Senate by a vote of 51-49 (Oomenici
voting for) was intended to allow the Labor Committee to fund school
vouchers for children who are the victims of crime.   It is basically not
implement able although it does change budget resolution numbers. The
amendment came in the form of a second degree to the Wellstone amendment


(the Republicans wanted to avoid an up or down vote on Wellstone) .

 The text of the amendment states the intent as described above, and
simply strikes Wellstone number changes and inserts an additional   (not
offset) $2.5 billion in 2000 in budget authority for Function 400, it also
adds an additional $2.5 billion in budget aggregates. Outlays are not
changed, the discretionary caps are not changed, nor is the Labor
Committee reconciled the additional spending.  Since the stated intent of
the amendment is not binding, the only effect of this amendment is to
increase Function 400 education spending (budget authority only) in the
year 2000.

During the debate, there was a great deal of confusion about the amendment
and and many members (including possibly Senator Domenici) apparently
thought it was a Sense of the Senate.    The education community is
concerned that some will represent this as a test vote on vouchers (the
Senate has always filibustered vouchers in the past) but I'd chalk it up
to confusion and play down the voucher piece of this.

In any event, there is common agreement internally that the amendment
should be dropped in conference.
