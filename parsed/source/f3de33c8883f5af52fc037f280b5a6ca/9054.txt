TEXT:
I am writing to formally advise you of my decision to join the Vice
President's staff this fall. As you know, this has been an extremely
difficult decision for me. I still have serious reservations, mostly
because of the incredible opportunity I have had learn and contribute at
the DPC and to work with such talented people.  While I love my current
job, however, working for the VP will give me a chance to develop my
career that I don't want to pass up.

As we have discussed, it is still my intent and great desire to serve with
the Domestic Policy Council and remain as integrated as possible with the
work you do here.  I have talked with Chris at some length about how this
might work, and he and I both believe that I will be able to continue to
serve both him and you on a range of health policy issues.

I also intend to do everything I can to make the transition a smooth one
for Chris and the DPC.  I plan on remaining here until the end of the
Congressional session, as we have discussed.  Ron Klain has asked that we
find a temporary detail to help with VP events this fall.  We will work
with David Beier as to how best to do this.

Thanks again for the opportunity that you have given me here to be a part
of the incredible team you have put together here.   It is a great honor
to work for and learn from such committed people who work so creatively
and diligently to serve this President.
