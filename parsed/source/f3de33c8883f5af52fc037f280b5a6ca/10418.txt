TEXT:
Eli Segal has been pushing for the President to come to his next
conference in Miami on Feb. 26. Jeff Forbes told me today that the
President will not be able to attend because he will be in California that
day. Eli is reluctant to change the date b/c they have scheduled 5 CEOs
and they will not be able to secure all 5 if we move the date.   Do you
think you could raise this with Doug to see if there's anyway the
California piece can be changed -- or postponed so that the President
could go to Miami in the morning. The welfare event could be anytime on
the 26th, but changing the date would be extremely hard.
