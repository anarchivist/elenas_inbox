 This version is signed off on by OMB, HHS, FDA, USDA, and USTR.  Only
 issue -- O'Hara/HHS really wants the line saying the Institute will be
 "under the leadership" of HHS and USDA, .  This line is in the current
 version, but you may want to remove it -- the structure of the Institute
 is what the 90-day plan will do. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ===============

MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
              SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE


SUBJECT:               JOINT INSTITUTE FOR FOOD SAFETY RESEARCH

        Americans enjoy the most bountiful and safe food supply in the world. My
Administration has made substantial improvements in food safety, from modernizing meat,
seafood, and poultry inspections to creating a high-tech early warning system to detect and
control outbreaks of foodborne illness.

        Our success has been built on two guiding principles: (I) engaging all concerned parties,
including consumers, farmers, industry, and academia, in an open and honest dialogue about
improving food safety; and (2) grounding our efforts in the best science available. We have
made good progress, but more can be done to prevent the many foodborne illnesses that still
occur in our country.

        As we look to the future of food safety, increasingly science and technology are playing a
central role. An expanded food safety research agenda is essential to continued improvements in
the safety of America's food. We need new tools to more quickly detect dangerous pathogens,
like E. coli 0157:H7 and campylobacter, and we need better interventions that reduce the risk of
contamination during food production.

        Food safety research is a critical piece of my Fiscal Year 1999 food safety initiative.
Unfortunately, Congress has not yet fully funded the initiative. We will continue to work with
Congress to invest more resources in this effort so vitally important to America's families and to
the public health. In order to help improve the safety of our Nation's food supply, I also have
proposed two critical pieces oflegislation to bring our food safety system into the 21 st century.
First, my Administration has proposed legislation that would give the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) greater authority over imported foods. This legislation will ensure that
the FDA halts imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food products that do not meet U.S. food
safety requirements or that do not provide the same level or protection as is required for U.S.
products. This legislation gives FDA authority that is similar to the authority that the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) already has to prevent the importation of unsafe meat and
poultry. In addition, we have proposed legislation that would give USDA the authority to
impose civil penalties for violations of meat and poultry regulations and the authority to issue
mandatory recalls to remove unsafe meat and poultry from the marketplace. I urge Congress to
pass both these bills in order to protect our Nation's families and to improve the safety of our
Nation's food supply.

        In this time oflimited budgets, however, we also need to make every effort to maximize
our resources, including coordinating our research efforts across the Federal government and in
the private sector. Our interagency food safety research working group is a strong start, but it is
one that we must build on.

Agriculture to report back to me within 90 days on the creation of a Joint Institute for Food
Safety Research that will: (1) develop a strategic plan for conducting food safety research
activities consistent with the President's Food Safety Initiative; and (2) efficiently coordinate all
Federal food safety research, including with the private sector and academia. This Institute
should serve as the focal point for coordinating food safety research, under the leadership of the
Secretaries ofHHS and USDA, across the Federal government and should work to leverage
resources with the private sector, including the use of public-private partnerships, or other
appropriate mechanisms. This plan should build upon my Interagency Food Safety Initiative and
should make provisions for cooperation and consultation with consumers, producers, industry,
and academia as well as other Federal and state research and public health agencies.

        You should call upon the Envirorunental Protection Agency, the National Partnership for
Reinventing Government, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and other agencies
as appropriate to provide you with assistance in achieving this goal. These steps, taken together
and in coordination with our pending legislation, will ensure to the fullest extent possible the
safety offood for all of America's families. I appreciate your commitment to improving food
safety, and I look forward to your continuing leadership in developing this Joint Institute for
Food Safety Research.
