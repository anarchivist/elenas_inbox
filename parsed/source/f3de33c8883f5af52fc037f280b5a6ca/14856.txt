TEXT:
Kerby Alvy, Executive Director of the Center for the Improvement of Child
Caring, has been working with the Women's Office over the last year and
has requested a meeting with DPC to discuss the effective parenting
movement and specifically his proposal for the creation of a Presidential
Council on Effective Parenting.  (Alvy wanted to meet with Bruce but I
don't think that is necessary.) Alvy's goals for such a council might be
achieved better through other mechanisms, which we can discuss at the
meeting.

I have tentatively set the meeting for 11 am on March 26. A1vy is based
in California but will be in DC then to speak at the Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Program's Stengthening America's Families
Conference.

Let me know if you are interested and can attend.

Please let me know if you are interested in attending the meeting and can
make that date and time, and I will circulate some materials to you.
