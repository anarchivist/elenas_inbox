                                        Tobacco Q&As
                                         April 8, 1998



Q:    What's your reaction to RJR Nabisco CEO Steven Goldstone's remarks today at the
      National Press Club?

A:    It is no surprise that the tobacco industry would protest the legislation moving through the
      Congress -- it is in their best interest to object to the bill now in order to prevent it from
      getting tougher on youth smoking. Why should we believe protests from an industry that
      won't admit that they marketed cigarettes to kids and still won't say cigarettes are
      addictive?

      We still believe that the tobacco industry will have every incentive to agree to legislation
      in the end, so that they can end this shameful chapter in their history and start off on a
      new path. In any event, the industry does not have veto power over what we do, and we
      will not back off such necessary l11easures to reduce youth smoking.

Q:    Will this deal drive RJR and/or other tobacco companies into bankruptcy?

A:   No. We're not trying to put the tobacco companies out of business; we want to put them
     out of the business of selling cigarettes to kids. We've done some careful financial
     analysis of the McCain bill, and we do not believe that it will drive companies into
     bankruptcy. The tobacco industry has financial difficulties because because of its
     massive liability risk, and this deal certainly doesn't increase that risk. Stopping
     companies from selling cigarettes to kids will not put them out of business.

Q:    But don't you need industry cooperation to enact tobacco legislation?

A:    We would like the tobacco industry to willingly join us in this effort to reduce youth
      smoking. But we can make progess even if they refuse to join us. We still believe that
      the tobacco industry will have every incentive to agree to legislation in the end, so that
      they can end this shameful chapter in their history and start off on a new path. In any
      event, the industry does not have veto power over what we do, and we will not back off
      such necessary measures to reduce youth smoking.
