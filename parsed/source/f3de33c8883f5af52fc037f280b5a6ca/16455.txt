J.P. Morgan Plans to Offer Domestic-Partner Benefits

  NEW YORK -- J.P. Morgan & Co. said it will offer medical and dental
benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of its U.S. employees, becoming
the first major Wall Street firm to extend such benefits to nontraditional
families.
  Though a growing number of companies are offering such benefits, few of
them are in the financial-services industry, benefits consultants say. In
addition to J.P. Morgan, which will begin offering the benefits in
December, BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co., two big commercial
banks based in San Francisco, have said they will begin extending similar
benefits next year.
  Among the major Wall Street firms, Merrill Lynch & Co.; Morgan Stanley,
Dean Witter, Discover & Co.; and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are all considering
introducing benefits for same-sex couples, but haven't done so yet,
according to spokesmen for the companies.        '
  In an internal memorandum distributed to J.P. Morgan employees
yesterday, Herbert J. Hefke, head of human resources, said the bank
expected only a small number of employees to take advantage of the new
benefits, with "minimal cost implications."
