WHITE HOUSE AIDS CZAR HAILS NEW TREATMENT
TO REDUCE MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION OF HIV

I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks and congratulations to
researchers from Thailand and the United States who have found an
effective and more affordable treatment regimen for reducing the
transmisison of HIV from mothers to children. They have brought a bright
ray of hope to the darkness of the AIDS pandemic.

This morning, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta announced
preliminary results from a controversial clinical study, showing that a
D&short courseD8 of zidovudine (AZT) resulted in a reduction by half of
the transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their newborn children.

This study has tremendous implications for helping curb the spread of the
AIDS epidemic. Most importantly, it demonstrates the efficacy of a
treatment regimen of AZT that is far more affordable and deliverable than
the standard course used in the United States.

With 5.8 million new infections occuring each year, most of which are in
the developing world, there is a desperate need for strategies to reduce
infections. Unfortunately, most of these countries have neither the funds
nor the infrastructure to support the long course of AZT that is the
standard treatment regiment for pregnant women in the developed world.
The new short course costs a fraction of the long course ($50 versus $800)
and does not require the intravenous treatments that would be virtually
impossible in most developing nations.


Based upon these preliminary results, the CDC (in conjunction with the
National Insitutes of -Health, the Agence Nationale De Recherches Sur le
Sida and UNAIDS) are recommending that controversial placebo control arms
of all similar studies be replaced by this new short course regimen.

This is a story about researchers, governments, and communities working
together to battle this epidemic. We now know about a tool to save
hundreds of thousands of children that would otherwise be lost.  The
challenge ahead is to figure out how to make this tool available as widely
as possible.  The United States will continue its leadership in addressing
the global epidemic, particularly in implementing this exciting new
treatment strategy.
