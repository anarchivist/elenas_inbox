TO:                ACTING DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                   ACTING DEP. DIRECTOR FOR MANAGEMENT ED
                           DESEVE
                   EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JUNE 17, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT



Tobacco: The Tobacco bill fell on a Budget Act point of order early this
evening; it now automatically goes back to the Commerce Committee.   The
Daschle motion to waive the point of order failed 53-46 (7 short of the
required 60) .  Earlier, the Senate again failed to invoke cloture 57-42
(3 votes short of the required 60) .

Budget Resolution:       While the Senate appointed conferees on the budget
resolution earlier this week, the House is not expected to appoint
conferees until after the Independence Day recess.    (The House will be in
recess June 26 through July 13.)   The House Republican Leadership is
delaying the formal appointment of conferees because that action would
give Democrats an opportunity to get another vote on a motion to
instruct.   We expect that conferees will not be appointed until Kasich,
Domeriici, Lott and Gingrich come to an agreement.

Ed DeSeve testified today before the House Government Reform and Oversight
Subcommittee on National Economic Growth, Natural Resources, and
Regulatory Affairs regarding implementation of the Congressional Review
Act by OIRA.

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee voted today to confirm Ed
DeSeveD,s nomination (voice vote) to be Deputy Director for Management and
Dee LeeD,s nomination (voice vote) to be Administrator of the Office of
Federal Procurement Policy.

Deputy Director for Management Ed DeSeve is scheduled to testify on Y2K
before the House Reform & Oversight Subcommittee on Government Management
on Monday, June 22.
