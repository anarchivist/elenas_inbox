TEXT:
I would really liked to have known about the deportation exemption for
Haitians before reading it in the NY Times. As you know, this is a
Florida issue, and the Governor deserved a heads-up on this.  His Chief of
Staff was not very happy with me this morning. And I am a little concerned
that he will find out that the groups knew and he did not. Chiles
supports the action (he is on the record for the Meeks bill), but wants
more info.  I assume we would all agree that his public support of our
action is helpful.  Is there something I can send him? If not, Elena, can
you call me and talk me through the policy? Thanks.-
