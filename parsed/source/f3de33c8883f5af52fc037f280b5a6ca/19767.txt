                       DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
                                                                                         March 31, 2010 (Senate)

                                                 S. 1723 - American Competitiveness Act
                                               (Abraham (R) Michigan and 15 cosponsors)

                              S.I723, "The American Competitiveness Act," is intended to respond toa reported
                      skills shortage in the information technology industry by increasing the annual cap on the
                      number oftemporary visas for foreign· "specialty"workers under the 8-1B program. For
                      the reasons outlined below, the Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 1723.
                      If S. 1723 were passed by the Congress and presented to the President, the Secretary of
                      Labor would recommend that he veto the bill.

                             Regrettably, S.I723 emphasizes providing opportunities for foreign workers rather
                      than providing opportunities for and protecting U.S. workers. The bill's temporary
                      increase in the annual number of 8-1B visas is too large (up to 115,000) and lasts too long
                      (5 years). In addition, the bill does not help ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to
                      temporary foreign workers and that qualified. U.S. workers have the opportunity to fill a job
                      before a temporary foreign worker is hired. Moreover, rather than strengthening program
                      requirements and enforcement to prevent employer abuses of the 8-1B program, S.I723
                      undermines some of the program's important enforcement provisions.

                             Since 1993 the Administration has sought reforms of the 8-1B program, including
                      requiring employers to make bona fide efforts to recruit and retain U.S. workers before
                      hiring temporary foreign workers and prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them
                      with foreign temporary workers. These reforms, if enacted, would help target 8-1B usage
                      to industries and employers that are experiencing skill shortages.

                              Also, the Administration believes that the first step in increasing the availability of
                      skilled workers for industry must be increasing the skills of U.S. workers and helping the
                      labor market work better to match employers with U.S. workers. Although S.I723
                      includes an authorization for a scholarship fund and a small fund to train dislocated
                      workers, the Administration believes that increased training opportunities for U.S. workers
                      should be funded through an 8-1B application fee paid by employers.

                              Substantial additional efforts by industry to increase the skill level of U.S. workers
                      and needed improvements in the 8-1B program are necessary prerequisites for the
                      Administration to support any short-term increase in the number of 8-1B visas available
                      for temporary foreign workers. The Administration wants to work with the Congress to
                      develop a bill that addresses the growing demand for highly skilled workers, while
                      effectively protecting and promoting the interests of U.S. workers and enhancing the
                      international competitiveness of important U.S. industries.
                                                                *******
