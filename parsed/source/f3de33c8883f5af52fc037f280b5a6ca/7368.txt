TEXT:
FYI:  I wanted you to know about charter school developments in California
and suggest that the President could -- if plans are still for the
President to respond to an Unz question anyway -- perhaps also calIon
Governor Wilson to sign a charter school bill coming to his desk that
day.
I describe the charter situation below and can find out more if: 1) there
still are plans for the President to take questions on Unz/ education at
all Friday, and 2) you think it could make sense for the President to
comment on charter schools too.

  Votes are expected tomorrow in both houses of the California legislature
  tomorrow approving a major expansion of the state's charter school law.
  After weeks of negotiations among Silicon Valley high-tech executives,
. the California Teachers' Association (CTA) , and state legislators, a
  legislative conference committee has agreed on a legislative
  compromise/alternative to a charter school ballot initiative backed by the
  executives and opposed by the CTA.    If the conference agreement is
  approved by both houses tomorrow (as expected), the legislation would need
  to be signed into law by Governor Wilson by Friday in order to keep the
  initiative off of the ballot.

Wilson is likely to sign and under pressure to sign because the bill is
supported by Silicon Valley, the CTA, charter advocates, etc. But those
in the negotiations say it is conceivable he'd veto it because 1) he'd
rather see Silicon Valley and the CTA in a fight about this, and 2) he's
worried that taking a controversial charter school initiative off of the
ballot would enable more CTA resources to be spent opposing his own
education ballot initiative.

Do you think this is worth exploring further?
