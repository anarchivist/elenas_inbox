TEXT:
Following the last Deputies meeting, in response to HHS' statement that
they have evidence of the positive effect of the Head Start quality
investments on Head Start quality, I asked my staff to obtain from HHS the
evidence to which HHS referred.  HHS did not have a document to share, but
did hold a lengthy conference call with my examiners.  This is a report of
that call.

In sum, HHS does not have data demonstrating that the investments in
"quality" and the related COLAs since the law was revised in 1994 have


resulted in a higher quality program.

What they do have is the first round of findings from an evaluation
("FACES" -- Family and Child Experiences Survey), which provides some
indication that Head Start projects are of "minimal to good quality."
(They did not find any "inadequate" programs.)

The programs were evaluated on the "ECERS" (Early Childhood Environmental
Rating Scale): it measures the use of materials, scheduling, facilities,
interaction between teachers/staff and children. This is a tool in
general use for assessing child care centers.  Eventually this
longitudinal study will report on the children's experiences in
kindergarten.

OMB is insisting that HHS carry the study into lower grades to try to get
a handle on whether Head Start affects learning in school, but HHS is
resisting strongly. We aren't sure why.

They do not have data showing a causal relationship between quality and
investments in quality, because they did not establish baseline data for
the evaluation or from the period before the new law.

The contractors (Westat and Abt) will eventually try to find a correlation
between quality and the higher salaries and benefits, more education for
staff, length of teacher time in the programs. HHS had not planned to do
this any time soon, but given the OMB (and working group) interest, HHS
will now try to produce this data in the next few months.

They did find some correlation (not clear how strong) between new teachers
and quality program, vs. the quality of programs with longer tenured
teachers.   This suggests that newly trained teachers may have a greater
benefit for students.

This provides some preliminary support for our new teacher preparation
scholarship.

In the conversation, it came up that since 1992, average Head Start
salaries have increased from $10,000 to $17,000, an increase of 70%. The
Head Start Director asserts, however, that this salary level is a "moral
disgrace."

This report does not provide a ringing endorsement for spending more money
on child care in the same ways in which it is spent in Head Start if, in
fact, we want to do something serious about improving the quality of child
care.  It also isn't much support for Head Start's set-asides.

OMB staff would much prefer investing in directed State monitoring of
health and safety conditions, State publication of "report cards" on child
care center quality, giving the States money to help centers meet
accreditation standards by the national body (NAEYC), and otherwise
supporting specific activities to correct flaws found by the monitoring.
$50 m/year, $250 mover 5, might be sufficient to get States to engage
more aggressively in such activity.
