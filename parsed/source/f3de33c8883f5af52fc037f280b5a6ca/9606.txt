TEXT:
today's POST has a John Harris story.  It tests the theory that he is
unable to govern because of the so-called scandal.  Can I get a laundry
list of issues he is focused on during this time? We need to change the
ill-percieved notion that the Pres is too caught up in this muck to focus
on the work he was elected to do -- which you know is not true ... can you
do a q&A on recent accomplishments, why this premise if false,
etc ... thanks.
