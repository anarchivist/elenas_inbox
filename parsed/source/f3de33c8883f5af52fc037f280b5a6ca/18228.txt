TEXT:
As I make an effort to clean my desk before leaving for the holidays, I
owe you a response to this idea proposed by Ray Bourhis for law firms to
raise funds for scholarships and outreach programs--i think it's a great
idea. As for where we are on the Higher Ed outreach effort--we've
received a packet of information from ACE (Eikenberry assigned Hector
Garza in his office to work on this--he sent the packet as well to
Edley)--I am in the process of reading their proposals andf will get back
to you, after ta~king to Chris and Elena--on the to do list for our first
week back.
