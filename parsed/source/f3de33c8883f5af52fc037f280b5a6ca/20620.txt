TEXT:
Yesterday we circulated for your review and comment a draft SAP on the
House child custody/abortion bill. The House Rules Committee will meet at
2 p.m. today on HR 3682 and full House action is scheduled for tomorrow.
Please let me know by 2 p.m. today whether you will have any comments on
the proposed SAP.     Our plan is to have the SAP ready tonight for final
White House sign-off.   Thanks.
