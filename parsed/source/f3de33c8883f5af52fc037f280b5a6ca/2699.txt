       We have three goals for the policy component of the proposed
racelreconciliation initiative. These are:

      (1) Establish baselines in key issue areas. Our first step must be to establish
      accurate and updated baselines in the areas of economic opportunity, education,
      health, housing and the administration of justice. It is important for us to assess
      what improvements racial minorities have and have not experienced in recent
      years. For instance: while some African-American and Latino leaders continue
      to call for expensive urban policies to create jobs, promote affordable housing
      and prevent crime -- the Administration's policies have created millions of jobs,
      increased minority home ownership and dramatically cut crime. Updated
      b.aselines that allow us to show who is and who is not benefitting from these
      trends will allow us to promote more informed debate and develop targeted
      policies.

      (2) Develop short-term initiatives. Our second goal must be to develop a
      series of policy initiatives that can be implemented throughout the year -- and
      used to complement the proposed events and town hall meetings. Our best
      opportunities here are two-fold: first, by developing policy responses to key
      race-related issues that we expect to arise (e.g., the impact of proposition 209 on
      minority enrollment in California Colleges); and second, by targeting existing
      Administration initiatives to address specific race-related issues (e.g., using the
      COPS program to crack down on hate crimes or EZ funds to promote minority
      job networks).

      (3) Develop long-term policy recommendations that go beyond
      Washington's left-right debate. Our most important goal must be to work with
      the Commission and their staff to develop long-term policy recommendations
      that go beyond the current polarized debate on race. These recommendations,
      which will be included in the President's Report to the American People, must
      also be achievable within the context of the budget agreement. Clearly, this will
      be the most challenging aspect of the racelreconciliation initiative. We strongly
      believe, however, that much can be accomplished without calling for new
      spending programs. Here are some initial ideas in each issue area:

            Economic Opportunity -- Perhaps the best opportunity here is in how we
            target the needs of minorities with respect to the welfare jobs initiative.
            However, additional opportunities exist to use the EZs, HUD CDBG funds,
            CDFls, Brownfields and other ongoing Administration initiatives to
            promote cUlturally-oriented development, minority job links and
            recruitment networks and increased access to capital. An equally
            ambitious effort would be to work with the labor unions to increase the
            availability of apprenticeship programs -- and ultimately union scale jobs --
            to minorities.

             some of our inner city schools.

             Health. Targeting the new health initiative for low-income children to
             serve key minority populations.

             Housing. Make HUO funds more flexible so that they can be used to
             actively promote the development of more diverse, mixed-income
             communities.

             Justice. Using the COPS program to dramatically increase the number
             of minority police officers serving minority communities; to increase
             diversity training for officers that work in minority communities; and to
             increase police resources in traditionally under served communities.


To guide these efforts, OPC -- in conjunction with the NEC --will convene work groups
in each of these areas.
