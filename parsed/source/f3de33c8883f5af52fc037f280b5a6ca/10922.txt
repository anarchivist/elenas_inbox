TEXT:
We had a preliminary meeting on next Tuesday's Accountability event in
Boston. Here's what we have so far:

Location:   The advance team will look at the four elementary schools we
have given them as options tomorrow.  Our options came as suggestions from
the Supertintendant of Boston City Schools/Mayor's Office. All schools
were recommended because they were identified as having made the most
progress in terms of test scores, etc. recently.

Timing: Due to the lengthy luncheon POTUS will attend right before
the event, the time being held is currently approximately 2:30-3:45pm.

Program: We are still trying to confirm whether or not Sec. Riley will go
to Boston for the event. Hopefully we'll know that tomorrow.   Otherwise,
the people who are currently possibilities on the program would include:
        Sec. Riley
        Mayor Menino
        Other Elected or Member of Congress, if they attend
        Someone from the school we choose
        Real Person
                - From my conversations with Mike, it sounds like the real
person we would want            is a teacher or parent that can talk
about their recent improvements and the                 difference their
new programs have made for the students and the school.

Audience: Small portion would be students from the school, hopefully from
older grades. The rest would be parents, teachers, community education
leaders.

Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.         Thanks!
