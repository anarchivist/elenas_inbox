Subject:         FYI -- Naturalization Accomplishments/Briefing Format

I met with INS and Justice staff to review progress in achieving the
naturalization milestones announced as part of the naturalization
improvement/reprogramming rollout and to develop a monthly naturalization
reporting format to track naturalization accomplishments.   I emphasized
the importance OMB placed on achieving these milestones and our intention
to closely monitoring progress.

In general, INS has moved forward with the incremental improvements they
agreed to accomplish by October 1.

They have restructured the naturalization operation and merged the
naturalization policy shop into INS' organizational/operational
structure. A respected interim Deputy Executive Associate Commissioner
for Immigration Services has been announced and INS' Deputy Commissioner
is expected to select division heads for customer service, backlog
reduction, reengineering and operations next week. We expressed concern
that these division heads be permanent not interim selections so they can
take charge/responsibility upon their appointment.

Backlog reduction "managers" have been selected for the top six cities.
INS does not agree with our concept of backlog reduction or SWAT teams
·    J



    that are mobile, dedicated to backlog reduction, and report to
    headquarters, preferring to designate "teams" at the district level that
    report to the district director.  To date no "teams" have been established
    using existing resources -- however, their activation under the INS
    definition may await the approval of the reprogramming.

    Most of the minor restructuring/reengineering accomplishments INS agreed
    to complete by October 1 should be implemented -- probably late, but
    within the month of October.

    Report Format: With INS and Justice, we worked through a draft reporting
    format that INS will begin submitting to OMB on October 15 and on the 15th
    of each month through FY 1999. They agreed to all the data elements we
    requested and will establish milestones and deliverables by month so we
    can track progress.  This reporting format will be used to belief the AG
    and CJS Appropriations committee staff, which have sought similar
    information. A draft reporting format will be developed and submitted to
    OMB by September 18th.

    If you have any questions regarding the above, please let me know.       Thanks.
