                                STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

               I have today approved H.R. 12Bl, the "War Crimes Disclosure
          Act." This Act, sponsored by Representative Maloney of New York,
          urges United States Government agencies to make
          public any records concerning individuals alleged to have
          committed Nazi war crimes.

               My Administration is committ~d to ensuring the widest
          possible disclosure of government documents. On April 17, 1995, I
          signed Executive Order 1295B, which will make available certain
          previously classified national security documents while
          safeguarding information critical to our Nation's security.
          Additionally, my Administration worked closely with Congress on
          the recent passage of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act.
          I believe that our democratic principles require that the


 American people be informed of the activities of their
 government.

      Over half a century has passed since the conclusion of World
 War II and the end of the Holocaust, one of the most horrifying
 periods of genocide in world history.  I strongly believe in the
 central finding of this Act, that it is important to learn all we
 can about this terrible era so that we can prevent such a
 catastrophe from ever happening again. To that end, the Act
 calls for more comprehensive disclosure of documents specific to
 Nazi war crimes.  It is clearly in our public interest to learn
 any remaining secrets about the Holocaust.

      I'm pleased that the Act recognizes the need not to disclose
 material that is still important to U.S. national security
 interests.  I am hopeful that the Congress and the Executive
 branch will continue to work together to balance the public
 interests of disclosing government records with the national
 interests of keeping certain documents protected within the
 context of future initiatives in this area.

      Ensuring a full accounting of United States records on Nazi
 war criminals is an important step in preserving the memory of
 those who died and honoring the sacrifices of those who survived.
 I am pleased to sign this Act into law.
