TEXT:
did you get Rodney's memo to Gene and Bruce suggesting a White House
Conference on Safety?? This is more DPC than NEC, although my earlier
life makes me very interested in this and Dorothy Robyn is working with
DOT on lots of these issues.

Do you like the idea??   Please call Dorothy in my absence
