fyi--

I gather that late last week Ken Apfel signalled a bit more flexibility
on the issue of authorization levels for Title III. OMB would ok an
overall increase for all of Title III (including, but not limited to
HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and Tribal Colleges and
Universities) from the FY 98 request of $205 million to $235 million for
FY 99 (an increase of about 15%), with flexibility for ED in how to
allocate that.   In the legislation ED could either be specific about
authorization levels for specific sections or just indicate that each
section will get an increase.     $235M would be less than the what ED
sought in its proposal (about $270 M, I think).   Alternatively, ED could
go to Raines, but might not even be able to bank on the $235 M.    ED will
need to think through whether this amount would suffice and I'm sure this
will be discussed at Tuesday's meeting with Riley.

-- Bill
