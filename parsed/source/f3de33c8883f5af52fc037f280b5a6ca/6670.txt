TEXT:
We are in the process of preparing talking points for the Council meeting
that begins on Sunday. I am assuming since I have not heard otherwise that
there will be no decision on needle exchange prior to the meeting. Any
update on the decision memo?

. There is an increasing amount of interest in the meeting. It now appears
  that we are going to have some demonstrations in addition to other press
  activity. What fun!

Any advise and counsel you can provide will be much appreciated. For all
intents and purposes we have made no visible progress on this issue since
these folks were here last time. They are not amused. Any crumbs we can
throw them will be helpful. Any ideas?

Thanks!

Sandy
