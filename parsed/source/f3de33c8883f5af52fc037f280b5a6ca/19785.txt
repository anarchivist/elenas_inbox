The Dem. Caucus is checking out a couple of times for a Child Care mtg w/
Members next week. They have offered 10:30am - 11:30am or 2:00pm.- 3:00
pm on Thursday (5/14).  Please let me know which time might work better
for you.

Additionally, Janet and Gephardt's staff are trying to schedule a staff
level mtg for Tuesday or Wednesday. Would 1:30 pm on Tuesday (5/14)
work? If not, please offer some other times.    (Are you in on Tuesdays,
Jenn?)

Thanks-
Mindy
