             "CREATING A NEW SPIRIT OF SERVICE AND CITIZENSHIP"
                   OP-ED FOR THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER
                       For Publication: Sunday, April 27, 1997

        Two hundred and ten years ago, at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia,
Benjamin Franklin noticed a design painted on the back of the chair from which General
Washington had presided -- a sun hanging low on the horizon. Throughout the difficult months
of the Convention, Franklin could not decide whether it was rising or a setting sun. But as the
Convention came to a close, and as the delegates signed America's Constitution, Franklin
concluded that the sun was most definitely rising.

        Once again, at the dawn of the 21 st Century, America finds itself looking toward the
future with hope and possibility. And once again, here in Philadelphia, we have chance to
reaffirm the basic bargain that has kept us strong since the framers' day: opportunity for all,
responsibility from all, and a united American community, where everyone has a role to play.
Citizen service is a critical way to fulfill those ideals. To me, it is the very essence of
citizenship itself, for it enables all of us -- parents, religious and civic groups, business and labor,
teachers and schools -- to solve our problems together, as one community.

        This weekend at Independence Hall, we have a tremendous opportunity to rekindle that
sense of citizenship, all across America. Former President George Bush and I will convene the
Presidents' Summit For America's Future -- a three-day gathering that will focus the nation on
the importance of citizen service, and in particular the steps we must take to strengthen
America's children. We will be joined by every living former President or his representative.
In the months and years to follow, our goal is to mobilize millions of Americans to help
America's children through service: giving them mentors and positive role models, ensuring that
they have a safe and healthy start, giving them the tools to succeed through education, and
engaging them in community service as well.

       I am especially pleased that the entire effort is being chaired by General Colin Powell,
who knows how to mobilize Americans when our national interests are at stake. Together with
the Summit's Vice Chairs, former HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros and Lynda Robb, General
Powell has already led an impressive effort to recruit businesses and non-profit groups, religious
and civic leaders, and citizens from all 50 states and from 140 cities and towns for this
weekend's gathering. My hope is that we will leave Philadelphia with a new sense of duty as
Americans, and a new determination to carry the ethic of service into our daily lives.

        Citizen service comes in many forms. Some volunteer on weekends, and some devote
full years of their lives to service. Private organizations playa strong role -- such as the
Philadelphia Inquirer, which is donating a dime from every street sale of this issue to the massive
clean-up of Germantown Avenue which the First Lady, Vice President and Mrs. Gore and I will
join this morning. We must honor and encourage all forms of service and voluntarism, and we
must applaud the many private and non-profit organizations that have already stepped forward
with commitments to serve, helping to fulfill President Bush's vision of a Thousand Points of

                                                                     Hex.Dump Conversion

        Light.

                It is especially important that we engage America's young people in service -- so that they
        take leading roles in shaping their own futures, and gain the sense of citizenship that will build a
        better country for decades to come. That is why I am so proud of AmeriCorps, the national
        service program I launched four years ago, now run by Pennsylvania's former Senator, Harris
        Wofford. Since its creation, AmeriCorps has enabled 50,000 young people to earn money for
        college while serving their communities.

                The success of AmeriCorps shows that service can help meet our most pressing public
        needs, from renewing our cities to protecting our environment, from immunizing children to
        helping them learn to read. Even more important, AmeriCorps reaffirms America's basic
        bargain: creating more opportunity by helping young people pay for college, asking more
        responsibility through citizen service, and, building a stronger community for us all. Our
        evidence shows that their service leads to more service: a typical AmeriCorps member trains or
        recruits a dozen or more volunteers.

                In preparation for the Summit, I have taken a number of actions in recent weeks to
        encourage more young people to serve. I designated the week of April 13-19 as National
        Service Week in America, with over one million young people participating in 3,000 projects
        across our nation, and thousands of AmeriCorps alumni and returned Peace Corps volunteers
        participating as well -- reaching out to youth in their communities and teaching a new generation
        about the power of service. I challenged every state to make service a part of the curriculum in
        high school and middle school -- giving students credit for service, putting service on their
        transcripts, or even requiring it, as Maryland has done under the leadership of Lieutenant
        Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. I launched a new National Service Scholars program,
        inviting high schools to select students who have performed outstanding service, making them
        eligible for $1,000 college scholarships.

                 These efforts are just the beginning of what we will see at this weekend's Summit, and
        what we can achieve through AmeriCorps, President Bush's Thousand Points of Light
        Foundation, and the campaign that general Powell will lead to follow-up on the Summit,
        "America's Promise -- The Alliance For Youth. Together, we must foster a spirit of service that
        lasts a lifetime, not merely a week or a weekend. The era of big government may be over, but
        the era of big national challenges is not. Service is a way to meet today's challenges through our
        oldest values: more opportunity, more responsibility, and a stronger community for all.

                This weekend, the city that gave birth to our democracy can playa major role in renewing
        our democracy. For I believe that today's peace and prosperity are much like the sun that was
        painted on General Washington's chair -- a sign of promise and possibility, but only if we are
        ready to embrace it. For the sake of our children -- for the sake of our own future -- let the sun
        rise over Independence Hall this weekend, and let this be the dawn of a new age of service and
        citizenship for America.
