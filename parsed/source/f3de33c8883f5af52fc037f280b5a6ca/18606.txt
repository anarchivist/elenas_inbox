FYI -- Later today Dawn and I expect to circulate the revised Affirmative
Action self-assessment guidance for internal vetting here.  For the ACE
conference this weekend, ED and DOJ are simply going to work with a set of
questions, and will not be distributing the narrative text that discusses
Bakke, etc.

Thanks.

-- Bill
