 TEXT:
             Angus King from Erskine's office asked for some brief notes on
             labor's likely issues tomorrow.

             I prepared the attached which I discussed with Diana and
             indirectly with Monahan. Couldn't reach the rest of you and they
             wanted it tonight.

             If there are changes that need to be made, I can make them
             tomorrow prior to the 12:45 pre-briefing.

          Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT      1 ====================

 BRIEFING ON LABOR'S WELFARE REFORM CONCERNS

 The following briefly summarizes the key issues related to
 welfare reform that organized labor has raised to us previously,
 their status, and our suggested response.
 1. Privatization of Administrative Functions
 PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_ROMAN_ITALIC
 Concern Allowing states to contract out the administration of
 Food Stamps, Medicaid, or welfare.
 Problem The states have the legal authority to contract out
 administration of the welfare block grant.  They need a
 waiver to do this for Food Stamps and approval for
 Medicaid. Both Texas and Wisconsin are well down the
 road in developing their plans to contract out.
 Response        Since (a) we do not have a definite position yet on


  this issue and (b) we don't have a legal basis to turn
  the states down, we should probably just listen.

                  -      -
  2. Public Comment Period on State Welfare Plans
  PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_ROMAN_ITALIC
  Concern Ensuring that HHS requires a 45 day public comment
  period before state welfare plans are certified as
  complete.
  Response          HHS will require comment periods, but they can take
  place after the plan is submitted to the federal
  government.  Plans will be certified as completely only
  after the comment period has ended.    Funding will be
  retroactive to plan submission.

  3. Continued Medicaid Funding for Immigrants
  PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_ROMAN_ITALIC
  Concern Ensuring that all immigrants.will continue to get
  Medicaid even after losing their SSI.
  Problem This is a budget issue.    It may be possible to let
  states do this administratively, but the cost could be
  over $1 billion over six years.
  Response          We share this concern. Need to look at it in the
  context of the budget.

  4. Employment Rights for Welfare Recipients
  PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN- ITALIC
  Concern Providing greater labor protections for those in
  "workfare" programs -- working for their welfare.

 Response        We have pressed for greater protections in the past.
 We will work with them on this in the new Congress.

 5.  "Fix" Legislation
 PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN- ITALIC
 Concern They have a list of issues they would like a "fix" bill
 to address.
 Status            While we know we will be submitting a budget which
 would restore some of the cuts, we are not sure what we
 will do in terms of legislation on some of the other
 policy issues: labor protections, privatization, etc.
 Response          We should indicate openness to hearing their concerns,
 and express that we are still developing both our
 substantive ideas and our strategy.
 PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN
 6. Job Creation Legislation
 PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_ROMAN_ITALIC
 Concern They have a series of concerns       wanting more money
 ($10 billion, not $3 billion), preferring job creation
 to job referral, DOL administration, etc.
 Status            The details of the proposal are still being
 developed, but the broad outlines remain what they were
 in August. Development will continue into January.
 Response          We will continue to work closely with them on the
 development of this initiative and will try to
 incorporate some of their concerns.
