TEXT:
Elena ... I understand that we are going to put on a meeting this afternoon
to discuss the HHS law suit, but that you need to hold a few discussions
first.   Do you have any preference for when we schedule the meeting?
Also, can you send me a list of the folks you'd recommend we include?
Thanks a lot. k
