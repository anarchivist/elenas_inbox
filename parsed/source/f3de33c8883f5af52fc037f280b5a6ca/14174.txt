TEXT:
USDA fears that more and more states will be asking shortly for
the same treatment as Calif. NY, WV, and Iowa have inquired;
Illinois has already written a letter. Yvette thinks all the
states will view this as "what have I got to lose?" once they hear
about it from an APWA bulletin. And then we will risk having
Congress say we are simply delaying implementation of the law for
no reason.
She is worried that the grace period she gave Calif that other
states now want has no clear legal basis, and so extending it to
many states increases the risk.
She is concerned that Illinois's request does not have any
substance to it in terms of requesting a specific waiver. It just
says "give us what you gave to Calif".  She may call them and ask
what they want specifically.
Elena: do you want to call her? Emily?
