TEXT:
Q.     How does the VA's proposed legislation affect benefits for
smoking-related illnesses?

A.      The VA's legislative proposal precludes benefit eligibility for
smoking related illness that arise after service. Currently, veterans who
began smoking during military service may qualify for compensation if they
later develop a smoking-related illness.

Q.      What is the justification for this policy, given that nicotine
is addictive and that the government distributed free cigarettes to
service members?

A.      VA's legislative proposal is based on the position that
compensating veterans for the results of their smoking simply exceeds the
Government's responsibility to them. While it is true that military
services facilitated service members' smoking habits, smoking has never
been required -- many veterans have never smoked -- and members have been
as able as their civilian counterparts to weigh the potential health risks
of using tobacco products.
