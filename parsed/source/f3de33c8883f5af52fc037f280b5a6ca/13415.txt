         Dear Ms Kagan
         David Loevner recently made me aware of the fact that there are two former Sachs
         Scholars working in the same building ...
         I'm sure that you must be very busy - but if you do have time for coffee or
         lunch at some point, I would be very interested in hearing about your time at
         Worcester, as well as your work for the Administration.  I myself am working as
         a Staff Economist at the Council of Economic Advisers until the end of this
         year, when I return to England to finish my D.Phil.
         Yours
         Andrea Richter P'91
