 FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

 DATE:      SEPTEMBER 10, 1997

 SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 Budget Committee Chairmen Domenici and Kasich held a press conference
 today objecting to the Shuster highway bill as a budget buster.    In his
 statement, Domenici said:  "The House bill will break the agreement by
 authorizing all five years of highway and mass transit contract authority
 given to them in the Budget Agreement over the next three years. The
 consequences of this action is to authorize approximately $40 billion over
 the next five years for transportation spending above the Budget
 Agreement.  If the Appropriations Committee chooses to eventually fund
 this higher authorization, any additional spending by the Appropriations
 Committee for ISTEA activities will have to be offset by reductions
 elsewhere among discretionary spending accounts."

 Chairman Domenici is announcing the creation of four Senate Budget
 Committee bipartisan task forces on:   (1) Social Security, chaired by
 Gregg;  (2) foreign affairs budgeting, chaired by Gordon Smith; (3)
 education funding, chaired by Frist; and (4) federal credit programs,
 chaired by Abraham.  The foreign affairs task force will have a hearing on
 September 30.

 Administrator Sally Katzen will testify on Friday, September 12, before
 the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs regarding S. 981, the
 Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997.
