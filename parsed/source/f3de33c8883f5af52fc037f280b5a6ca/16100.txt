If we're going to mention the specific labor issues, would we also want to
mention the other welfare issues we care about with regard to
reconciliation?

(1) New Policy - No

(2)  It may be that the President will address fair labor/displacement,
etc. issues. As yet, it remains in brackets.

 (3) As we approach the one year anniversary of the welfare reform law, the
President will announce that there are 3 million fewer people on welfare
rolls since the day he took office. He will talk about what we are doing
to build on our progress, and what we need to do to meet our goal of
moving one million more people from welfare to work by the year 2000.
This discussion includes some mention of the balanced budget agreement's
provisions targeting assistance to cities and rural areas with high
concentrations of long term welfare recipients.

In other words, not really.

Hope this answers your questions.
