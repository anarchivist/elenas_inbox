TALKING POINTS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY EVENT
MARCH 26,1996


oThank you for coming to the White House today. We're in a tough fight against some very bad
      legislation, and you all are on the front lines of that fight.

oThe bill we're fighting is H.R. 956, the so-called Common Sense Product Liability Legal Reform
       Act of 1996. ?????????? will discuss with you the legislative status of this bill. What
       I'd like to talk to you about is why the President opposes it, why he will veto it, and why
       we have to fight to sustain that veto.

oOn whose behalf are we fighting?

oWe're fighting on behalf of consumers.

oWe're fighting on behalf of the victims of shootings and the victims of drunk drivers.

oWe're fighting on behalf of the victims of potential utility accidents.

oWe're fighting on behalf of the victims of products that use biomaterials, like the Dow Corning
       breast implant case.

oAnd we're fighting on behalf of the rights of States, which have traditionally retained authority
      over liability issues but would lose it under this legislation.

°H.R. 956 would encourage wrongful conduct, and it would prevent injured persons from
       recovering the full measure of their damages. That's wrong.

oIt's why we object to the elimination of joint-and-severalliability for non-economic damages.
        We believe this would prevent many victims from obtaining the damages to which they
        are entitled.

oIt's why we object to the capping of punitive damages. We believe that would increase the
        incentive of manufacturers to knowingly produce and sell defective products.

oAnd with regard to states' rights, here we have perhaps the greatest irony of all coming out of
      this Congress. All they talk about is giving power back to the States. I hear Bob Dole
      thinks it's so important to talk about States' rights that he pulls out a copy of the Tenth
      Amendment to the Constitution at every campaign speech.

oWell, here's what they really think of States' rights. Under their product liability bill, States can
       go beyond this new Federal law -- as long as they are taking steps to make the law even
       more pro-business. But if they try to pass State laws that are more pro-consumer, forget
       it. This bill says, no way.
                                                                            Hex-Dump ConversIon
oSo State's rights are ok if you want to screw consumers. But if you want to protect them, don't
       even think about it.

oThat's unfair and it's hypocritical, and I'm sure you agree with me on that.

oLet me be clear. The President is not opposed to sensible, limited product liability refonn.
       But this legislation doesn't come close.

oNow, I don't have to tel1 you how hard the Republicans and major business organizations have
       been working this legislation. They're depicting the President's stand as a giveaway to
       lawyers.

oWel1, you're the people who can stand up and tel1 the American people what this is real1yabout.
       It's not about lawyers; it's about the rights of consumers. I urge you to stand up and be
       counted on this legislation.

oFor those of you whose organizations have been working against this legislation, keep up the
        good work. For those that have not, please get involved. Speak out. Get your
        constituencies to speak out. Alexis Hennan is here to talk about how you can help.

oThe President is taking a tough stand here, and he's taking a lot of partisan criticism for it. I
       think he deserves your support. I know he appreciates it.

oThank you.
