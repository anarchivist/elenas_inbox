TEXT:
Mary Smith asked me to forward to you some radio address ideas.

Two ideas sent in by the Dept to Cabinet Affairs are below:   (1) Higher
Ed reauthorization or (2) Prevewing the Mayor's conference on public
education.

We could also highlight the 15th Anniversary of a Nation at Risk.
As we mark the 15th anniversary of A Nation At Risk, there is genuine
cause for
hope about the future of American public education.
We have turned a corner: the" record thus far gives us reason for continued
efforts toward reform.

THE GOOD NEWS:
DO      Vastly increased public interest in education
DO      Demonstrated improvement in mathematics   (4th grade TIMMS scores)
DO      Growing innovation and public school choice: has inspired
creation of good programs,
        increased parental participation (Need umbers on growth of
charters)
DO      Movement toward standards and away from social promotion
         (New York City, Chicago)
DO      WeD,re integrating technology correctly
DO      Growing professionalism within the teaching profession
         (union focus on school reform, recent NEA support for peer review)


THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE DONE:
DO      Performance still lags on some indicators e.g. 8th grade and
12th grade TIMMS
DO      Urban and poor rural schools (e.g. reasons for Zones)
DO       Need to focus on recruiting and retaining talented teachers
DO      School still have to focus on O&peripheral08 issues that affect
their ability to educate:
        drug use, violence, teen pregnancy etc.

THE CASE FOR CONTINUED REFORM ... ACCELERATED AND INCREASED:
DOThis bad news often overwhelms the national debate,
and can lead to a kind of reform fatigue -

DOUltimately, thatO,s exactly what vouchers are: giving up on public
education ...
a few students may be served better by them, but in the long run our
larger society suffers

OOBUT, for all the reasons articulated above, the evidence just does
not support the conclusion that this task is beyond us.  Since a Nation At
Risk weO,ve reached
 1.



a national consensus that we should reform education -- and seen growing
evidene that we can.

DDThis is a particularly critical moment to move forward: schools are in
the midst of large-scale changes (baby boom echo, retiring of baby boom
teachers, implemeting standards,), our socitey is increasingly global and
knowledge-based, etc
DDHiglight Clinton Adminstration K-12 education proposals - class size
zones, construction etc

      Kris/David -- listed below please find 2 radio address suggestions
      from ED per your request on this morning's conference call. Please
      call me at 401-2571 if you need additional information.  Thank you.

      * The Higher Education Reauthorization bill is expected to be
      considered on the House floor next week. House Republicans are now
      trying to claim credit for the proposal being considered to lower the
      student loan interest rate.  In fact, the bill also provides a large
      and costly subsidy to banks at the expense of taxpayers -- this is
one
      of a number of reasons senior advisors recommend a veto. Other
      concerns with the bill include: a proposed amendment by Rep. Riggs
      which would deny federal funds to public higher ed institutions with
      affirmative action policies; and a House committee provision
      originated by Rep. Goodling to block grant teacher training funds
      instead of funding the National Board for Professional Teaching
      Standards. A hallmark of the Clinton Administration has been to
      increase access to higher education for all Americans and we will
      continue efforts to ensure that students who work hard will have the
      opportunity to go to college.

      2) Preview next week's u.S. Conference of Mayor's meeting by
      addressing the President's proposals for critical education


    investments to help urban areas: education opportunity zones which
    include a requirement to end social promotion; as well as class size
    reduction, school construction, and expanding after-school programs.
    These are all serious issues which must be addressed to improve the
    learning environment for students, particularly those in urban and
    rural schools. These are meaningful approaches to ensure that
    students can learn to high standards. Unfortunately, this Congress
    has chosen to do nothing so far to seriously address these concerns

    which Americans say are among their most important.  Instead, they
    have passed an insignificant tax break of $7 to help families with
    children in public schools and a voucher program for the District of
    Columbia.
