TEXT:
Secretary Shalala may call Leon to follow up on an issue from the
meeting we had yesterday on welfare reform implementation,
As you may remember, one item of discussion was the
Administration's policy on whether state waivers allow states to
get around the bill's time limits, work participation requirements
and related policies,
The lawyers agree that the law probably allows state waivers to do
this.
We all agree that as a matter of policy and positioning, however,
the administration should be opposed to this and should say so
strongly.
The only issue is how to make our position known.
We meet weekly with state organizations (NGA, NCSL, APWA) and the
next meeting is Monday.  They have asked us to clarify our
position on this question.  HHS does not believe that there should
be an answer in writing to this question,
Because it is so important, most of us at the White House believe
it should be in writing and provided on Monday since (1) we are
getting hit hard publicly for failing to be clear in our
instructions to states, and (2) leaving i t to word-of-mouth
increases the chances that conflicting messages will come out of
the administration.
HHS feels so strongly that they say they will have Shalala call


Leon to contest the decision.  I can't believe they would push so
hard on this type of issue, but they may, so I wanted to be sure
you had the necessary info to brief Leon.
It would be very helpful if Leon could reinforce to the Secretary
that this is our policy and that we need to take the necessary
steps to ensure our policies are clearly understood.
Please let me know if you need anything else.
