TEXT:
Maria Echaveste's office called me this morning because you were unable to
make it to her 9:00 am monday Deputies meeting. They asked me if you
could designate someone else (they suggested myself or Chris Jennings) to
cover the meeting if you could not attend.

I advised them I would need to discuss with you.  I would you like to
handle? I am happy to fill in if you can't.   You could just have Laura
page me.
