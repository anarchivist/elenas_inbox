TEXT:
The editorial you sent me this morning took a number of people by
surprise, including myself, Eddie Correa, Riley, and Norma Cantu's
Deputy.  I don't have a good handle on this yet, but have been promised
something in writing by first thing in the morning.  Riley wants to send a
response to USA Today; I've made clear we need to see it before it goes
out.

I'll keep you   pos~ed   in the morning
