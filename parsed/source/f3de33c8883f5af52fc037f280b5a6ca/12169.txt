TEXT:
We have asked Mike Smith's office for the report of the Education Dept
independent review panel getting released Friday and the press paper on
it.   Education will send us copies of the report tomorrow morning and
press paper tomorrow afternoon. Apparently, we will not have an
opportunity to make comments on the report, because it was developed by an
independent review panel. Mike Smith will do a press conference on
Friday, though Education doesn't expect a lot of press attention.
