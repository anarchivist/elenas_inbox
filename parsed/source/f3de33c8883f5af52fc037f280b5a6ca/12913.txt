      Theaters To Ask Teens for IDs

      By TERENCE HUNT
      AP White House Correspondent

     WASHINGTON (AP) 0* President Clinton won pledges
     from thousands of movie theaters today to require photo
     identification from young people seeking admission to
     R-rated movies.

     Clinton had challenged the industry to enforce the rating
     system more strictly in the wake of the high school
     shootings in Littleton, Colo.

     In response, the National Association of Theater Owners
     said it would adopt a new policy requiring youths
     unaccompanied by adults to produce a photo ID before
     being admitted to R-rated films. The association
     represents about 20,000 screens 0* 65 percent of the
     motion picture screens in the United States.

     Clinton was announcing the association's pledge in a
     ceremony in the Roosevelt Room with William Kartozian,
     the association's president; Barrie Lawson Loeks, its
     chairman; and other theater executives.

     The president was using the occasion to repeat his
     challenge to the movie industry to re-evaluate its entire
     ratings system 0* particularly the PG rating 0* to
     determine whether it is allowing children to be exposed
     to too much gratuitous violence.



  He also was urging the House to pass tougher gun
  control legislation. In May, the Senate approved new
  provisions to require background checks of purchases at
  gun shows, require child safety locks, ban the import of
  large capacity ammunition clips and prohibit violent
  juveniles from owning guns as adults.

  Clinton was calling on the House to strengthen the
  Senate-passed bill to include provisions to raise the age
  of handgun possession from 18 to 21 and require
  background checks for explosives purchases.

  The president, in his May 15 radio address, issued three
  specific challenges to the entertainment community:
  stop showing guns in ads or previews children would see,
  check IDs at R-rated movies and re-evaluate the entire
  ratings system to determine if too much violence was
  being shown to children.

  Clinton said the typical American will see 40,000
  dramatized murders by the age of 18.

  The movie rating system was adopted by the Motion
  Picture Association of America in 1968. The White House
  said it can be a useful tool for parents but only if its
  main restrictive rating 0* R for "Restricted: under 17
  requires accompanying parent or adult guardian"   0* is
  effectively enforced.

  The National Association of Theater Owners said it would
  post notices of its new policy.

  The theater owners also pledged to undertake a national
  community education effort to develop additional
  programs to enhance the ability of parents to make
  informed decisions about which movies are appropriate
  for their children. They will work with parent and
  religious groups to develop those programs, officials
  said.

  Further, the theater association endorsed the idea of a
  national study of youth violence.

  Clinton has directed the surgeon general to compile a
  report on youth violence by next year
