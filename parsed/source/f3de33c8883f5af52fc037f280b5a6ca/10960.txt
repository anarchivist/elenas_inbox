Hi everybody! i'm taking this opportunity to just update everybody at the
same time ... Robert Pear of the New York Times called at 3:10pm and wanted
some information on Welfare-to-Work ...
specifically:
 *how many and which states turned down w2w funds
 *a table which shows how much each state was alloted
 *the amount each state "drew down"
 *the total amount of w2w funds for this year
 *the total amount for last year ...

Lynn gave me the latest state by state break down ... we also
included the two 1999 w2w releases for Louisiana and Missouri ..
the fact sheet from the White House event.  It turns out he just
wanted the information and didn't want to talk to anybody ...
He says his deadline was today, so i assume we'll see something in the


paper
tomorrow ...
