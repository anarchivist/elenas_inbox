     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
     RADIO ADDRESS ON POLICE MISCONDUCT
     THE WHITE HOUSE
     March 12, 1999

             Good morning.  I am joined here at the White House today by
     representatives from law enforcement and civil rights groups to talk about
     what we must do to strengthen the bond of trust between police officers
     and the communities they serve -- and make our streets safer than ever.

             For too long, violent crime seemed destined to rise in America.
     Six years ago, I took office determined to change that. Working in
     partnership with state and local law enforcement, we put in place a
     comprehensive crime fighting strategy -- with more police, more'
     prosecutors, better prevention, and fewer illegal guns. Today, we know
     our strategy is working beyond our expectations. Nationwide, crime is
     down to its lowest levels in decades.  In communities across America,
     families feel safe again.

             Community policing has been at the heart of our success. By
     giving police the chance to get to know the people on their beats    and
     by giving those people the chance to be part of the law enforcement
     decisions that affect their lives -- community policing has created a bond
     of trust, strong enough to turn back the rising tide of crime.

             We know that the vast majority of our nationD,s police officers
     put on their badges every day and put their lives on the line for our
     safety.   So like all Americans, I have been disturbed that in some


communities, allegations of serious police misconduct -- including the
demeaning practice of racial profiling -- are undermining the bond between
police and the people they protect.

        When it comes to winning the war against crime, we must keep
fighting on every front.   Today, I am proposing four steps to continue
reducing crime and increasing the publicO,s trust in law enforcement.

         First, better training and better education lead to better policing.    I
am asking the Justice Department to expand police integrity and ethics
training to all 25 of our regional community policing institutes. And I
am proposing a $40 million increase in funding to improve police training
nationwide, and to help police officers raise their level of education --
and their level of understanding.

        Second, communities and police must work as partners in the fight
against crime.  I am proposing to launch a new nationwide program to help
more communities establish citizen police academies that inform residents
about police procedures and teach them new ways to make their
neighborhoods safer.

        Third, police departments ought to reflect the diversity of the
communities they protect.  To help meet this challenge, I am proposing to
increase funds for minority recruiting -- build up the bond of trust where
it is most needed.

        Fourth, when police officers do break the law, we must bring them
to justice. My budget includes new funding to enforce our civil rights
laws so a few bad cops donO,t undermine the progress that hundreds of
thousands of police officers have worked so hard to achieve.

        Finally, we must continue the revolution in community policing we
began six years ago.  I calIon Congress to build on our progress by
passing my $1.3 billion 21st Century Policing Initiative to put up to
50,000 more police on our streets and give them the high-tech tools they
need to do their job.

        We know these steps will work.  In Boston, when tensions grew
between police and the community, law enforcement and community leaders
came together to do something about it.  They established clear guidelines
to involve residents in police decisionmaking and to hold police
accountable for their actions.  Today, the crime rate in Boston has fallen
to record lows -- and so have reports of police misconduct.

        Today, I am asking Attorney General Reno to convene a series of
meetings with law enforcement and community leaders to discuss how
communities around the country can follow BostonO,s example, and ensure
that our criminal justice system serves all Americans. Together, we will
build safer communities and be one step closer to building one America in
the 21st Century.

        Thanks for listening.
