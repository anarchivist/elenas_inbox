TEXT:
There are three issues on the table.   The issue of requiring IHS to pay
out health benefits on a pro rata basis was resurrected. today by the clerk
of the Appropriations Committee.  OMB was working to try to send out a
letter on that issue. The other two issues from yesterday are still on
the table.  They are the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health
Service Tribal Contract moratorium and the Enzi/Sessions Amendment on
Indian Gaming.   The contract moratorium would interfere with tribal
self-determination by prohibiting tribes that want to contract for their
own health services or other services. The gaming provision prevents
Interior from promulgating gaming provisions for the tribes so that the
tribes will not have recourse against states that do not negotiate "in
good faith" on gaming. Apparently, two days ago at a bill signing in the
Oval, the President said we should not give on these issues.   I guess Jack
Lew and Sylvia have been negotiating on the gaming issue today -- our
position is that we should not give on this.   I haven't heard how the
negotiations went.  As can be expected, the state governors are very
interested in this issue.
