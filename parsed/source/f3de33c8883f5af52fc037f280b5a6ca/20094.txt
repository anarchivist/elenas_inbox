TEXT:
Per our    conversation this morning, thank you for calling Pres. Atkinson.
He is a    good "friend," and very thoughtful.  I forgof to mention to you
that he    would also like to talk to Mrs. Clinton.  I will mention this to
Melanne    as well.

Atkinson's number is 510-987-9074.

As you recall, he called me last Friday.  His idea is that the President
propose leg. or an Administrative rule suspending all fed. financial
support for public schools that do not have affirmative action programs.
He argues that this will help Cal. schools enormously because Prop. 209
contains a provision that roughly says, "if 209 interfers with the receipt
of federal $, then Prop. 209 is invalid."   Thus, the President's move
would invalidate 209.

He thinks that the proposal should also include a sunset clause, something
to the effect that "after 25 years, Affirmative. Action plans are
dismantled. "

Maria mentioned several weeks ago that our higher ed. / race work was on a
time line for September.  I mentioned this to Atkinson in our conversation.

Thanks.
