TEXT:
As we discussed, Marcia is inclined to believe that Guiliani would attend
an immigration meeting with POTUS if it is small enough (like 15 people)
and if he has a high profile role. She prefers a meeting to an event in
the east room, but could be convinced if Bruce likes the event idea.
Bruce--if Cynthia hasn't yet expalined to you--Janet's idea was to have an
event in the east room with a table up front with mayors/congressman/real
people and an audiance of folks who would be cut off if our budget proposa
1 fails. Marcia feels uncomfortable doing a welfare event in the east room
and I can see her point. Also--after talking to Marcia, I am concerned
that we wouldn't be able to have enough mayors at the table with this
format to make Craig happy.

To keep Craig happy we need about 5 mayors including NY    (we think, we need
to talk to Craig). If we did 3 members and 5 real peple   that's 13.
Janet--can you live with a meeting of that size? If you   had 3, who would
they be? We'd invite LA as one of our 5 and then maybe    a FL, TX, and
Seattle.
