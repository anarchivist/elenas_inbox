TEXT:
Caroline Fredrickson called last night to say Podesta was planning a
meeting with Harkin (sponsor of a comparable worth bill) and leaders of
the comparable worth movement for next week.  These groups want to raise
the bar and get the President to endorse comparable worth.   The groups in
one on one discussions have somewhat bought the argument that we need to
take the obvious first step of moving Daschle and then engage eventually
in talks about comparable worth. When they are all together, however, as
they were for a meeting in the Women's Office last week,   they tend to go
towards a comparable worth mantra and say the Daschle bill is worthless.
My instinct is that we would be better off without a meeting and that we
keep talking to them one on one.  If there must be a meeting, if it should
be done with just Harkin and Podesta (or even better with Daschle planning
how to keep a unified face on the equal pay issue). Otherwise the meeting
is likely to become a forum for the Administration to get grilled on
comparable worth and then promise to review it with the likelihood that we
get into squabbles with the groups and lose our momentum.
