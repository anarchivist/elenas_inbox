TEXT:
Richard Cohen is looking into issue and I gave him our views (or what I
think are our views). The only thing I gave him that I'm a tad uncertain
about is that I said we believe this should be determined by public health
experts and scientists, but I did say we've accepted the twin requirements
set by Congress (slowing spread of HIV and not resulting in increased drug
use). Anyway, he's not sure if he's writing, and if he is, it would be
for Monday at the earliest.

If anybody feels compelled to talk to him about this, his phone is
1  P6/(b)(6) I, but please talk to me about that.
