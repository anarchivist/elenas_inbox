TEXT:
           Dorothy will be calling people's offices to set up a meeting late
           Friday (or maybe early Monday) for us to discuss the technical
           corrections package for welfare reform.  Dorothy will be
           circulating an updated package to you today, that we got at a
           meeting with Tarplin and an assortment of agencies.

           The goal of the meeting is to just quickly highlight among
           ourselves what issues are embedded in the package. OMB has many,
           many concerns, especially in trying to coordinate this thing, but
           this meeting would be more to focus on any genuine policy
issues.
           Jeremy and I will take a shot at highlighting them at the meeting
           in case you don't get time to look at the package, but we can't
           promise we won't miss something.


           HHS wants this to go to the Hill Fri. the 22nd,   so they want to
           wrap this up on Wednesday.

           Tarplin wants to consult w/Hill staff in advance on a few
delicate
           items, to make sure we don't walk into anything unexpected, but
           Keith asked that they hold up on that until OMB has had more time
           to look at it. So we need to get back to them.

           For those who care, the Medicaid bucket issue is embedded in
here.
           So if we include it, we are giving up on our other avenue.     So
           that has to get settled.
