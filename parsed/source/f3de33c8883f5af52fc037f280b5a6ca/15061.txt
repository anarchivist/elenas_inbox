TEXT:
On Thursday afternoon, April 3 at 3:00pm (room 472) we are having a
meeting with a group of gay and lesbian anti-violence (hate crimes)
advocates from around the country.  They will also be meeting with the
Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and the AAG for Policy
at DOJ earlier in the day.  These meetings come at their request to
discuss the recent rise in hate crimes directed at gay and lesbian
Americans. I'd appreciate it if you were able to attend. Please let me
know. Thanks.
