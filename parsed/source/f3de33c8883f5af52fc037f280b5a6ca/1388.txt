I vote for TANF only.  That's clearly the import of what we're telling all
private employers to do, and we should hold ourselves to the same
obligation.
On the other question, I'm with NPR that we shouldn't pre-screen.  The
agencies aren't as afraid of us as they are of the President, and they'll
be more rather than less likely to present shoddy work if we set up a
layer between them and the President.
