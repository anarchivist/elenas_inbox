TEXT:
We'll get you a more complete right up soon, but to answer your question
from yesterday --

The five states that failed the two parent work participation rate and did
not meet the 80 percent maintenance of effort requirement are Arizona,
Nebraska, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Virginia. To avoid the larger MOE
penalty, these states will be given the opportunity to report additional
MOE expenditures they may have made during the reporting period.   (They
may very well have additional state spending for the time period that will
count as MOE.  Since four of the five states reported MOE of exactly 75
percent, they may have reported only as much MOE as they thought they
needed to meet the requirement) "
