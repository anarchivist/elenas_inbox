DRAFT -- April 10, 1997


                         STUDY ON DESEGREGATION TRENDS


Q: This week a group of Harvard researchers released a report that concluded U.S. schools
are becoming increasingly resegregated, diminishing gains made since Brown v. Board of
Education. The authors blame the Supreme Court, but also fault the Clinton
Administration for having a lackluster commitment to integrated education. Is this a fair
criticism?

A: I strongly disagree. We have made a historic commitment to improving quality of education
for all students, through our strong support for high academic standards for every student, record
levels of investment in programs that improve schools and provide extra help to disadvantaged
kids, a nationwide call to mobilize a million reading tutors, and vigorous enforcement of the laws
that guarantee equal educational opportunity. Moreover, we have strongly enforced laws against
discrimination in housing. But beyond that, we are firmly committed to doing everything we
can to improve race relations in this country, to bring people together rather than drive them
apart.
