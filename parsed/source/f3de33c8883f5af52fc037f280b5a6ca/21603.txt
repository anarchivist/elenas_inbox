    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:          Bruce Reed
                   Elena Kagan

    RE:            DPC Weekly Report


              Health Care -- Patients' Bill of Rights Event at AFSCME: On Monday, you are
     scheduled to participate in a roundtable discussion with health care workers and patients
     on the patients' bill of rights at the Association of Federal, State, County, and Municipal
     Employees. We are also working with a number of candidates around the country, who
    .have indicated interest in downlinking this event to patients' rights rallies in their districts.
       At this event, you will receive a status report from the Vice President outlining how the
     five Federal agencies with primary jurisdiction over health care have responded to your
     executive order directing them to ensure that their health plans come into compliance with
     the patients' bill of rights. This report will underscore that while the Republican
     Leadership has allowed Congress to adjourn without passing a strong enforceable patients'
     bill of rights, you are taking every possible action to implement these protections for the 85
     million Americans in Federal health plans. You can also reiterate your strong
     commitment that p.assing a patients' bill of rights that applies these protections to all health
     plans is a top priority for you in the next Congress.

            Health Care -- Meeting With The Disability Community: This week, Justin Dart and
    other leaders in the disability community met with us to outline their policy priorities as we begin
    our preparations for the FY 2000 budget. At this meeting, they expressed their extreme
    appreciation for your support of the Jeffords-Kennedy work incentive proposal and indicated
    their commitment to working with the Administration on this and other issues of interest to the
    disability community. They were also pleased to have their opinions solicited so early in the
    budget process. DPC and NEC are in the process of exploring other work incentive and long
    term care initiatives that would provide the disabled with the health care services critical to
    achieving independence. We will be outlining these options to you in the upcoming weeks.

            Health Care -- Pediatric Labeling Initiative: Last year at an event with the First Lady,
    you announced our intention to release an FDA regulation that would require manufacturers to
    conduct the necessary studies to provide pediatric labeling information for physicians treating
    children. This announcement was widely praised by pediatricians and the advocacy community,
    especially those for children with AIDS. Subsequently, FDA reform legislation was passed with
    the intention of complimenting this regulation by awarding short term patent extensions to offset

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
legislation, the industry has taken the inaccurate and untenable position that the legislation
assumes voluntary and not mandatory compliance with these regulations. However, because of
the industry's sensitivity about the regulation and their influence over the confirmation of Jane
Henney as FDA Commissioner, the final regulation was not published. Now that Dr. Henney
has been confirmed, the First Lady's office believes (and we agree) that we should expedite the
release of the regulation. Although Dr. Henney strongly supports this regulation, we may want
to release it prior to her swearing-in to assure that her first regulatory initiative is not excessively
controversial.

        Crime -- Brady/National Instant Criminal Background Check System: This week,
the Justice Department will publish the final regulation implementing the Brady National Instant
Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Under the NICS, which will go into effect on
November 30th, the FBI and/or state points of contact will conduct computerized background
checks of all prospective guns purchasers (not just handguns). Implementation of the NICS is a
significant accomplishment for you and this Administration -- starting with the fight to enact the
Brady Bill's passage in 1993, to securing funds to improve state criminal history records, and
more recently, thwarting Congressional efforts to undermine Brady's final implementation.

    Drugs -- Medical Marijuana: On Wednesday, a letter was released to the press signed by
former Presidents Carter, Ford and Bush, stating their opposition to pending state medical
marijuana ballot initiatives. Current polls indicate that medical marijuana initiatives will pass in
Alaska, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia. It is unclear whether the initiative
will pass in Nevada. Arizona -- which passed a broad medical marijuana initiative two years
ago -- has another ballot initiative which would essentially moot the earlier vote; however, it
appears likely that this second measure will fail.

         Welfare Reform -- New Jersey Fanlily Cap Study: On Monday, New Jersey will
release its latest evaluation of the state's family cap policy. We understand that the major
findings in the report, prepared by Rutgers University researchers, are a decrease in births to
families on welfare and a small early increase in abortions. Secretary Shalala sent you a memo
about the draft Rutgers study in June, pointing out that both New Jersey and HHS had serious
methodological concerns with the study. The Department is reviewing the latest study in more
detail, but remains concerned with the methodology (in particular, the study may not have
controlled sufficiently for other factors that may had an impact on abortions). A total of 23
states have chosen to adopt a family cap policy since the passage ofthe welfare reform law (up
from 15 states that had waivers to implement this policy).
