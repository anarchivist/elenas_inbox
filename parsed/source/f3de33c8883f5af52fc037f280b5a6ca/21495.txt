PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
STATEMENT ON THE BUDGET
THE WHITE HOUSE
October 9, 1998

                        Good afternoon.  I have just had the opportunity
to meet with Senator Daschle, Representative Gephardt and their
colleagues. We have been discussing the course of the budget on Capitol
Hill. And we stand united in insisting that Congress act immediately to
pass a budget that honors our values and meets AmericaD,s priorities.

        This is a year when we should be able to make real, bipartisan
progress. We have created the first balanced budget and surplus in 29
years. Our economy continues to be strong, creating jobs and broadening
prosperity, despite economic turmoil abroad. We have an opportunity to
maintain our fiscal discipline while making the investments we need. We
can sustain this American economic renaissance.

        This budget is a test of whether we will act together to advance
the national interest -- whether we will invest in the education of our
children, the security of our parents, the strength of our economy.   Let


me make clear my priorities.

        First, as I made clear in my State of the Union Address, our central
budget challenge is to maintain our fiscal discipline.   I have insisted
that we set aside every penny of any surplus until we save Social Security
first. All year long, the majority party in Congress challenged that
principle, first with a $700 billion tax plan, then with a $80 billion
plan, all draining the budget surplus.  I said no.  It now appears that
common sense has prevailed, the surplus is secure, and America is now
well-positioned to craft a bipartisan plan to save Social Security for the
next generation.

        Second, we must widen opportunity by investing in our children and
in their schools.   This budget should reduce class size by hiring new
teachers ... bring discipline and learning into the lives of all our young
people by fully funding after-school programs ... bring cutting edge
technology to the classroom, with teachers trained to use it ... and
expand Head Start.  It must also teach our children to read, and support
our new mentoring drive to encourage young people to go to college.

        Unfortunately, when the education investment bill was finally
brought to the House floor yesterday, eight days into the fiscal year, it
met none of these challenges.   I have instructed my budget team to return
to Capitol Hill, make the case for our educational priorities, and fight
for our childrenO,s future.   I am confident we will prevail.

        Let me add that in these closing days, it is clear that Congress
will not take necessary action to modernize and build 5000 new schools.
More teachers and smaller classes also demand more schoolrooms.  If we do
not succeed this year, we will be back next year to fight for this
priority.
        Third, we must strengthen our economy at a time of economic
turmoil abroad by meeting our obligations to the International Monetary
Fund.  Every day of delay is another day of putting our prosperity at
risk.  I am confident Congress will do the right thing.

        Fourth, we must strengthen, not weaken, environmental protections.     I
simply will not allow a budget that is stuffed with unrelated,
controversial provisions that would cause unacceptable harm to our
environment and hamstring our protection of the public health.

        Fifth, we must act decisively to help AmericaO,s farmers and ranchers.
This year, drought, disease and international economic turmoil have hit
AmericaO,s farm families hard.  I vetoed a farm bill that did not do
enough to help AmericaO,s farm families during this difficult time.  And I
have instructed my budget negotiators to insist on stronger emergency
measures to help AmericaO,s farmers and ranchers.

         Sixth, we must make child care more affordable and ensure the quality and
safety of care for millions of American children.   Parents have a hard
enough time meeting their responsibilities at home and at work -- and we
must take responsibility for helping them do it.

        Seventh, we must continue our successful drive to move people from
welfare to work.  Just yesterday, Congress passed my innovative initiative
to help 50,000 families move closer to good jobs. ThatO,s a strong step
in the right direction.  In the coming days, we can do more to help people
move from the dependency of a welfare check to the dignity of a paycheck.

        Eighth, I will continue to resist extraneous and controversial provisions


that simply make i·t harder to meet our obligation to fund the government
and invest in our people. This is no time for debate over social issue
measures, such as those on family planning, that will mire this necessary
bill in needless controversy.

        We stand together for these priorities. They are the right
priorities for the American people. And I believe that if Congress puts
progress over partisanship, we can come to an agreement on a budget that
maintains fiscal discipline, honors our values, and invests in our
people.
