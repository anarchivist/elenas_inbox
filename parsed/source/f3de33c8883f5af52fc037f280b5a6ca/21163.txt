Subject:         Gov. Chiles

Gov. Chiles wants to meet with Erskine on Tues., Sept. 22 regarding
tobacco.  The Governor's primary objective. during his last few months in
office is to finalize Florida's stake in the tobacco settlement .. The
Governor is holding his afternoon open between 1:00 and 6:00 for this
meeting.

I didn't know if you wanted to handle this directly w/ Erskine, or if you
wanted me to deal with it on a staff level.  Please advise.  Thanks.
