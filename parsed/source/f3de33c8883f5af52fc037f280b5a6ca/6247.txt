Update:

Following my conversation with Gene and Elena this morning, I have called
Lisa Ross in the Secretary's Office at Labor and told her that a stand
alone event was now being considered for POTUS to announce the expansion
of FMLA.  Per Gene, I told them if they wanted to go forth with a 5th
anniversary event, they could, but would be asked not announce the
expansion information.  They are getting together and will call me with
their resolution.


Meanwhile we will work with Labor and Women's Legal Defense Fund in
thinking of small business that would be willing to stand with us or, as
suggested by NEC, going to a state where there is already a lower
threshold.
