I applaud the Senate for its leadership this morning in voting to close the gun show loophole once
and for all. In the wake of the recent school shootings, it is profoundly important that all
Americans come together and do everything they can to protect our children from violence. For
those of us in government that means enacting common sense laws that reflect the values of the
American people. By passing measures to help keep guns out of the hands of chi Idren and
criminals, the Senate is living up to this responsibility.
