MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

THROUGH:                 Jack Lew

FROM:                  Donald R. Arbuckle

SUBJECT:               DOT Rule on Intercity Buses


       We have nearly completed our review of a final Department of Transportation
(DOT) rule that will provide improved access for wheelchair-bound passengers to intercity
buses. The rule will require intercity fixed-route bus companies (i.e., Greyhound, Peter
Pan) to provide wheelchair lifts on their buses. At least one-half of each company's buses
must be made wheelchair accessible within 6 years, with the remainder accessible within 12
years. Small companies are subject to much less stringent requirements. The costs of the
rule have been reduced substantially from the proposal-- about $25 million in annual costs
as compared to $50 million at the proposed stage. Most of this reduction is in relief to
smaller carriers and charters.

       I have talked with representatives of both the disabled community and the industry.
The disability community strongly supports the rule and has been fighting ardently for the
wheelchair lift requirement for years. Smaller companies and charter operators (about
3500 companies) will also be reasonably satisfied. However, the largest companies, such as
Greyhound, who have argued most strongly against the rule, will not be happy.
Greyhound has been advocating a much less costly plan that would provide reasonable
accommodation to the disabled on 48 hours notice. Disability groups regard this as
"discriminatory", since non-handicapped passengers can purchase tickets without a
48-hour notice_ In addition, these groups do not believe Greyhound's plan will work.
DOT agrees.

      The final rule is under a September 15 court ordered deadline and we are working
with DOT to complete our review asap.
