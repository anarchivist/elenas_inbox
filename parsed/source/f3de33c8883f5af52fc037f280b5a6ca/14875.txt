BANK OF AMERICA WITHDRAWS SUPPORT FOR MARRIAGE,
BECOMES "ENEMY OF THE FAMILY," FRC SAYS

FAMILY GROUP DENOUNCES BANK'S PLAN TO SUBSIDIZE
OUT-OF-WEDLOCK "PARTNERSHIPS"

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- "Bank of America's announcement that
unmarried heterosexual 'partners' and homosexual 'partners'
will receive family benefits shows that the bank has joined
forces with those trying to destroy marriage as the core
institution of civilization," Family Research Council Director
of Cultural Studies Robert Knight said Wednesday.

"We applaud the bank's efforts to insure extended families,
but this should include relationships based on blood, adoption
or marriage," Knight said.  "It should not be used as a way to
broaden societal support for sex outside marriage.  The
destructive message that this sends young people is: you need
not plan for marriage, since you can have it all without


making that commitment.

"In an age when marital collapse is at the heart of our
downward spiral, Bank of America's action can only hasten
moral deterioration and threaten the well-being of children.
Research overwhelmingly shows that children do best in
families that have a married mother and father.  By
subsidizing non-marital relationships, Bank of America is
helping to doom more children to lives of insecurity and
heartache.

"We hoped that the bank had learned its lesson a few years ago
when it bowed to homosexual activists and cut off charitable
funding to the Boy Scouts of America for not having homosexuals
as scoutmasters. When outraged citizens withdrew millions of
dollars from the bank, the policy was reversed. Now, here they
are again, blatantly showing disregard for the moral order.
With a policy that can lead only to more marital destruction,
Bank of America must now be considered an enemy of the family.

"We urge Bank of America customers to let the bank know that
it has committed a grievous error, and we hope that the bank
will once again listen to reason. We also urge other businesses,
such as United Airlines, to challenge San Francisco's
oppressive ordinance requiring businesses that trade with the
city to provide 'partner benefits.' No government has the
right to force anyone to subsidize immorality, and the law is
clearly on the side of businesses that refuse to knuckle under
to Mayor Willie Brown's threats.  San Francisco's attempt at
tyranny must be resisted, not accommodated."
