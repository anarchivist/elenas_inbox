TEXT:
We managed to push them pretty far, I think, although they pushed back a
bit on the legislation issue (see third graph).  I believe this does not
commit us to send legislation to the Hill -- we only prepare legislation
if we can get members of Congress to work with us on it.



The Child Support Enforcement Financing
The Federal government has a strong interest in seeing that the national
child support system is effective.  Funding of the Child Support
Enforcement (CSE) program, however, remains needlessly complicated.
States get Federal payments covering administrative costs at several
different matching rates.  States also get Federal incentive payments,
levy user fees, keep a portion of TANF-related collections, and return a
portion to the Federal government.

Federal retention of TANF-related payments is a legacy of the old AFDC
program in which States and the Federal government shared in the funding
of AFDC, and therefore in the collection of child support for AFDC
recipients. With welfare reform, States have great freedom to design
assistance packages for families with dependent children.  However, States
must continue to share a portion of child support collections with the
Federal government.  This makes it difficult The need to share collections
under both prior and current law may serve as a disincentive for States to
pass through the full amount of child support to families and creates an
unintended incentive for States to serve TANF needy families through
programs funded only with State dollars.  Spending on these "State-only"
programs continues to count under the TANF maintenance of effort
requirement, but child support collections on behalf of these families do
not need to be shared with the Federal government.

The Administration will hold begin a dialogue with the stakeholders of the
child support program to look at ways to address these problems, and in
working with members of Congress will prepare legislation to be
transmitted to Congress later this Spring. The Budget would also take a
first step towards simplifying the child support funding structure by 1)


conforming the match rate for paternity testing with the basic
administrative match rate; and 2) repealing the hold harmless provision
established in welfare reform.

Conforming paternity testing payments with the basic administrative match
rate will simplify the funding structure and greatly increase the
incentive for States to control paternity testing costs. These costs vary
enormously from State to State.  Paternity establishment is a vital step
in establishing and collecting support orders. With the expansion of
voluntary paternity establishment authority and inclusion of paternity
establishment in the child support incentive payment formula, we believe
that the right incentives are in place to maximize the establishment of
paternities without an enhanced match for paternity testing payments.

The hold harmless provision in welfare reform guaranteed States at least
their FY 1995 State share of TANF-re1ated collections no matter what their
level of performance was.  We believe that this sends States the wrong
message and propose to eliminate this provision in order to assure that
poorly performing States have an incentive to increase their TANF-related
collections.

Taken together, these changes would equal about $300 million over five
years which is less than two percent of program costs. Under current law,
States have resources equal to about 116 percent of the amount that they
currently spend on their State Child Support programs.
