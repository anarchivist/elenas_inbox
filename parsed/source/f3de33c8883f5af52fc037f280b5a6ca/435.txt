MEMORANDUM FOR LEON PANETTA

SUBJECT:Possible Q&A on President's Campaign Finance Reform Announcement


QUESTION: Why are you announcing this now?

RESPONSE: This announcement is consistent with the President's long-standing commitment to
campaign finance reform and to changing business as usual in Washington. In the last three years,
the President repealed the tax loophole for lobbyist deductions, enacted legislation to make the
Congress and the White House live by the same laws Washington applies to rest of the nation,
signed legislation to require lobbyists to disclose how much they spend and what they spend it on,
enacted the line-Item Veto, and made it easier for millions of Americans to register to vote.

In 1992, the President made campaign finance reform a central piece of his agenda and throughout
his first term he pressed the Congress to pass real, bipartisan legislation.

QUESTION: Both parties have been unable to resolve the campaign finance reform issue for
years, why should the American people expect you and Congress to take action next term?

RESPONSE: Last Congress we enacted Lobbying Disclosure, the Gift Ban, Congressional
Accountability Act, the Line-Item Veto. We have a proven track record of getting the job done on
political reform. Campaign finance reform is the last step, and most important step. I believe that
the Congress should and must make passage of McCain-Feingold a priority. I challenge Congress
to pass the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill in the first six months of the 105th Congress, and not
deny the American people any longer. If that fails, I will challenge Congress to create a bipartisan
commission whose recommendations will become law on a fast-track basis.

QUESTION: There has been a lot of controversy about foreign contributions to the DNC. Do
you think it is wrong to accept contributionsfromjoreigners?

RESPONSE: I do believe the system is broken, and needs to be fixed. The voting public must
have confidence that the process is fair and works for them. That is why I agree with Senators
McCain and Feingold that real, bipartisan campaign finance reform must include effective
limitations on foreign contributions. If you can't vote you should not contribute.

QUESTION: Does your supportfor limitations onforeign contributions mean that you will
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

direct the DNC to stop taking such contributions immediately and return those contributions
received this elections cycle?

RESPONSE: No. It is clear that the system is broken and that the rules need to be changed. I
support banning these contributions by law. We need quick action by Congress on this issue as part
of comprehensive, bipartisan campaign finance reform. We will discourage those contributions
beginning immediately, but we will have no reliable way to verify whether contributions come from
citizens or non-citizens until Congress and the FEC require contributors to provide that information.

QUESTION: How willyou enforce this ban, and how broad will it be? For example, would the
ban include U.S. subsidiaries o/foreign-owned corporations?

RESPONSE: Many of the specific details of the ban would have to be worked out with Congress.
However, the'principle is clear, if you can't vote, you can't contribute -- individual contributors
would have to certify citizenship.

With regards to corporate contributions, the McCain-Feingold bill would ban PACs and eliminate
the current "soft money" system. Therefore, no corporate entity, foreign or domestic, could make a
Federal campaign contribution.

QUESTION: If you believe it is wrong to accept foreign campaign contributions, is it wrong to
acceptforeign contributions to your legal defense fund?

RESPONSE: I do not allow the Legal Defense Fund to accept contributions from registered
lobbyists and PACs. In addition, contributions are limited to $1,000. (Additional recommended
response is: "In the future, my legal defense fund will not accept contributions from foreign donors.)


QUESTION: Aren't you, by endorsing the bipartisan commission as afal/back position,
undermining any real hope that McCain-Feingold will pass?

RESPONSE: I have been and remain a strong supporter of McCain-Feingold, and believe the
principles of that legislation are the key elements of real reform: spending limits; curbing PAC and
lobbying influence; free and discounted broadcast time; and ending the "soft money" system. I
support a bipartisan commission only as a last resort, if the Congress lacks the political will to pass
McCain Feingold.

QUESTION: Mr. President, you are challenging Congress to pass McCain-Feingold in the first
six months of the 105th Congress. Will this be a number one priority for your administration?

RESPONSE: This will be a key priority in my second term. I have long felt that this is one of the
most important issues facing the American political system. We must restore the faith of the
American people in their political leadership in order to build a bridge to the 21st'century.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion



QUESTION: How does your plan compare with Bob Dole's?

RESPONSE: I support the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill. When he was in the Senate, Bob Dole
opposed that legislation. While Senator Dole introduced a bill to create a campaign finance reform
commission immediately, I supported efforts to pass real, bipartisan campaign finance reform. I
continue to support McCain-Feingold, and call on Congress to pass this legislation in the first six
months of the next term. However, if Congress cannot find the political will to pass
McCain-Feingold, then as a last resort I support creating a binding, bipartisan commission that will
send a real campaign finance reform bill to my desk by the end of next year. However, Senator
Dole and I do agree that non-citizens should not be able to contribute to campaigns for federal
office.

QUESTION: How would your plan to ban campaign contributions from foreigners impact
unincorporated partner~hips?

RESPONSE: Contributions from unincorporated partnerships would be pro-rated and counted
against the $1,000 individual contribution limit of each partner. For example, if a partnership of
ten individuals made a $1,000 contribution to a campaign, $100 would be counted against the
contribution limit of each partner. If a non-citizen was a member of a partnership, a greater share
of the contribution would count again~t the $1,000 limit of the other partners. A partnership which
is owned by a majority of non-citizens should be prohibited from making contributions.

QUESTION: How would the ban on non-citizen contributions affect entities, such as unions,
that collect funds for independent political expenditures?

RESPONSE: Independent political expenditures would not be covered by the ban on campaign
contributions by non-citizens. Independent political expenditures would have to be addressed
separately from the contributions issue.

QUESTION: How would the McCain-Feingold bill be impacted by the Supreme Court's decision
in Colorado Republican Campaign Committee vs. the FEC?

RESPONSE: In light of the Supreme Court's decision this summer, the restrictions proposed by the
McCain-Feingold bill regarding independent expenditures made by political parties will have to be
revisited. But it is clear that the issue of independent political expenditures is critical to the
overhaul of our campaign finance reform laws.
