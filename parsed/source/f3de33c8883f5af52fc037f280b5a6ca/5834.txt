TEXT:
Ron Haskins has apparently drafted a proposal on child support computer
systems problem, and he has invited HHS to a meeting on Thursday to
discuss. While I will be discussing the legislation in more detail with
HHS tomorrow, the proposal does seem to adhere to have the following
features, which I like:

        1) Penalties that are simple to adminster and automatic, with
little HHS discretion.
        2) An up-front penalty imposed immediately upon failure, which
should be large enough to motivate states to improve their systems
development, but not so large as to severely disrupt states' child support
efforts or to lead states to believe the penalty would never ,be imposed.
        3)  The penalties should include an incentive for early
completion, either by providing an earn-back of the initial penalty or by
imposing subsequent incremental penalties, or both.
        4) HHS should retain the ability to disapprove the state child
support plan and withhold all federal child support funds.

Under Haskins' proposal, states without completed, statewide computer
systems would get a penalty starting at 4 percent of FY 1997 Federal CSE
matching funds, a penalty which would rise by 4 percentage points each
year, up to a high of 20 percent in the fifth year and thereafter.  We
were contemplating somewhat larger penalties--S or 10 percent. Under the
Haskins proposal, a State would earn back 75 percent of the most recent
penalty (but not earlier penalties) once its system was certified--this is
also similar in principle to the approach we had discussed internally.
How does this sound to you?
