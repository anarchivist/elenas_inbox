GOV STILL MIGHT TRADE PAY
                       HIKES FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS

                     By GREGG BIRNBAUM and ROBERT HARDT Jr.

                     Gov. Pataki threw the door wide open yesterday to
                     cutting a deal with state lawmakers to give them
                     pay raises in return for legislation allowing charter
                     schools.

                     In his first press conference since the day after the
                     Nov. 3 elections, Pataki urged legislators to OK a
                     charter-school bill - and did not rule out approving
                     a salary hike if they did.

                     The GOP-controlled Senate, in coordination with
                     the governor's office, has begun reviewing
                     charter-school proposals for possible
                     consideration this week, sources said.

                     "There have been some discussions,"   a source
                     told The Post.

                     Pataki insisted a legislative pay raise "alone" was
                     not warranted since state lawmakers serve only
                     part-time.

                     But for the first time he expressed interest in
                     seeing what else may be included in a pay-raise
                     bill that could sweeten it for him.

                     "If a bill is passed, I will look at the totality of
the
                     bill,"   Pataki said.

                     "I always look at any bill in its totality to see if


on
                    balance I think it advances the interests of the
                    people of the state. I am very much interested in
                    seeing a charter-school bill."

                    In City Hall Park, charter-school supporters called
                    on the state Legislature to act.

                    "We believe charter schools offer a great
                    opportunity for pushing forward the kind of reform
                    that has long been promised but never delivered,"
                    said the Rev. Floyd Flake of Allen AME Church in
                    Queens.

                    "We stand together united for better public
                    education, improved charter schools, and we
                    believe that the Legislature ought to move now to
                    make it possible and to make it happen," added
                    Flake, who was joined by Rev. Ruben Diaz of the
                    Hispanic Clergy Organization and the Rev. Wyatt
                    Tee Walker of Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem.

                    State law would have to be changed to allow for
                    charter. schools, which are innovative public
                    schools that would' operate largely independent
                    from city and state education bureaucracy.

                    Pataki said he has discussed the pay-raise issue
                    separately with state Senate Majority Leader
                    Joseph Bruno (R-Rensselaer) and Assembly
                    Speaker Sheldon Silver (D-Manhattan), but he
                    refused to disclose details of the talks.

                    Bruno said no final agreement has been reached
                    between Pataki and legislative leaders on either
                    issue, but added that he expected negotiations on
                    the issues to take place today.

                    "I could support some form of charter schools,"
                    Bruno said. "Thirty-two other states have some
                    form of charter schools."

                    Members of the Legislature will be in Albany today.
                    The Democratic-controlled Assembly, where the
                    teachers unions are influential, has been the
                    biggest obstacle to charter schools in the past.

                    A bill that would grant legislators a whopping 38
                    percent raise - from a base pay of $57,500 to
                    $79,500 annually - was quietly introduced over the.
                    weekend in the Assembly. It would boost salaries
                    for judges, agency heads, and statewide elected
                    officials, also.

                    Pataki also said for the first time that he believes
                    state judges and agency commissioners deserve
                    more money;

                    "They are full-time employees who I would look at
                    differently from legislators. Legislators are not a
,. ''''


                        full-time position."
