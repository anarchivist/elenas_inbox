S. 18, the SAFER Meat and Poultry Act (Safe and Fair Enforcement and Recall)

Senator Harkin has again introduced the food safety bill we supported last year that gives
USDA much-needed leverage in regulating food processors and handlers. The SAFER
Meat and Poultry Act, one of the Democratic Leadership's Initiatives, would: (1) require
processors and handlers to notify the USDA about contaminated meat and poultry products; (2)
authorize USDA to conduct mandatory recalls of unsafe products; (3) clarify and reinforce the
USDA's authority to refuse or withdraw inspection of plants that violate safety standards or
procedures; and (4) give the USDA the power to assess civil fines for violations. Currently, the
USDA can respond to food safety violations only by bringing criminal actions or withdrawing
inspections; and all recalls are done on a voluntary basis and no civil penalties are available.

S. 74, Paycheck Fairness Act

The Paycheck Fairness Act, an equal pay measure the Administration supported last year, is also
included in the Democratic Leadership Initiative. The legislation, introduced by Senator
Daschle, includes three major provisions:

           Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation adds full
           compensatory and punitive damages as remedies, in addition to the liquidated
           damages and back pay awards currently available under the EPA. The proposal
           would put gender-based wage discrimination on equal footing with wage
           discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for which uncapped compensatory and
           punitive damages are already available.

            Non-retaliation provision. The bill would prohibit employers from punishing
           employees for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Currently, many
           employers are free to take action against employees who share wage information

           Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The bill provides for increased
           training for EEOC employees on wage discrimination;'more field research on
           equal pay; and the establishment of a national award to recognize model
           employers.
