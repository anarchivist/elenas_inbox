TEXT:
I will be going to the Short Term Scheduling meeting in Paul's absence
today at 3:30pm.  I will report back to you the results of the meeting,
but if there is anything you would like to push for let me know. Also, I
spoke to Mike Cohen about pending education requests.  (Reminder:  I don't
have a replacement pager yet, but I will check my voice mail right before
the meeting.)
