TEXT:
1. DOT tells me that efforts to achieve the compromise I outlined
to you over the phone have "fallen through." So the language I
gave you this morning is still the operative provision.
2. According to DOT, the problem with barring foreign seamen from
U.S. courts relates more to our obligations under international
law than employment opportunities for U.S. seamen. According to
DOT, as a practical matter, foreign flag carriers hire few U.S.
seamen anyway.
Thanks for your help.
