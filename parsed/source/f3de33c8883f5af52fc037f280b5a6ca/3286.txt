TEXT:
I've talked to Ken Apfel and Barry White about Title V funding, and here
is where things stand:

Ken and Barry more or less reluctantly agreed (Barry more reluctantly than
Ken) to recommend to Frank Raines that he go along with POTUS announcing
the Title V proposal at about $65 million, even though it is out of the
budget process and cycle, and that we worry later where the money comes
from.  Ken thinks the President ought to announce the one-year budget
figure, and that the legislation that is sent up ought to authorize "such
sums as are necessary" in the out.years.   However, if ED views the out year
costs as ramping up considerably as opposed to staying flat, he'd want to
revisit this. I haven't seen budget figures from ED, but I donj't believe
they were planning on much higher out year numbers.  I'll check on that
this afternoon.

Barry also wanted to make sure that ED doesn't ask for early budget
committments for any other parts of Title V. I don't think there are any
other parts to worry about, but I'll check this out as well.

Ken will let me know how Frank reacts to this.  He asked us to give him
some time to get to Frank before this is raised at a 7:30 meeting by one
of you.
