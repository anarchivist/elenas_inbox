Q:      A bill to outlaw the D&X abortion procedure is ready to be
considered on the House floor.   If the bill is passed, will
you sign it?
A:      The Constitution permits states to ban abortion after fetal
viability except when necessary to preserve the woman's life
or health. As I have stated consistently, I support such
post
o
-viability restrictions.  However, the House bill, as
currently written, is another matter entirely. First of
all, its ban on the D&X procedure applies even in cases
where the procedure is needed to preserve the health of the
woman. Second, the ban could apply pre
o
-viability. And
finally, it is a physician's job -- not the government's --
to use medical discretion to determine whether a certain
procedure is the most medically appropriate method for his
or her patient.
