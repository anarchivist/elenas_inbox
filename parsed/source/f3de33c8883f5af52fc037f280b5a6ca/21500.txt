TEXT:
FYI.  I have received calls today from the AFL-CIO, Farmworker's Union,
and the National Association of Hispanic Priests and Deacons, urging us to
reject any compromise on H-2A.  Also, according to the AFL, Delores Huerta
(co-founder of United Farm Workers of America) is apoplectic about how
Wyden and Graham misrepresented her in their op-ed today.  She intends to
respond.

I have also, in the last day or so, received letters opposing any
compromise on H-2A from the Farmworker Justice Fund and the National
Hispanic Leadership Agenda (that has members on its board from LULAC,
PRLDEF, MALDEF, and NCLR among many others).  The sense that I have gotten
from these letters and messages (and conversations with DOJ legislative
affairs) is that a compromise by us on this would be nuclear.
