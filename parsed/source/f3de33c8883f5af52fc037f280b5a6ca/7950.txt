TO:                 ACTING DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                    DEP. DIRECTOR FOR MANAGEMENT ED DESEVE
                    EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

FROM:       OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:       JUNE 3, 1998

SUB'JECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

Budget Resolution:    Rules Committee had been scheduled to meet today on
the budget resolution, but Chairman Solomon postponed the hearing subject
to call of the Chair.   He said it wouldnO,t make sense for the meeting to
take place until the Committee has received the managersO, amendment.
Kasich is still evidently leaving the .managersO, amendment open to change
while he tries to secure the votes for passage.    In addition to a
ManagersO, Amendment, the following amendments have been filed with the
Committee: (1) the Coalition plan, to be offered by Minge and Stenholm;
(2) a CATs plan to be offered by Neuman; (3) a plan with increased defense
funds, to be offered by Scarborough; and (4) the Democratic alternative to
be offered by Spratt.   Following are highlights of SprattO,s Democratic
alternative:
(1) protects Social Security and Budget Surpluses; (2) Rejects Republican
cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Mandatory Programs; (3) Protects key
NDD programs (education, environment, health, housing, law enforcement) ;
(4) Provides funds for some of the PresidentO,s initiatives (75,000
teachers; Medicare buy-in; child care; Ag Research; ChildrenO,s health);
(5) $30b.tax cut; and (6) Fully funds the highway/mass transit bill
(TEA21). Gephardt and Spratt may hold a press conference to announce the
Democratic alternative, as early as 10:30am Thursday.    [LA is
distributing details of the Spratt/Democratic amendment.]

to HR 2400. Efforts are underway in the Senate to clear the measure for
action tomorrow but there is not yet agreement. [LA is distributing copies
of the corrections bill.]

Ag Research: Today, the House entered into a UC agreement take up the Ag
Research Conference Report tomorrow. All points of order are waived, with
the exception of an unfunded mandates point of order (while the conference

vote). To be followed by a vote on final passage.
