SUBJECT:                                  Cloning: Legislative Options

        Interest in cloning legislation was renewed by reports that a Chicago physicist plans to
attempt to use this technology to create a child. Your January 10 radio address challenged
Congress to enact a ban on private sector activities like the one you have imposed on the use of
public funds. Congressional staff inquiries indicate that your challenge will be accepted. Both
critics and supporters of your draft bill agree that this issue raises complex drafting problems.
You have the opportunity at this juncture to stay with existing language or, alternatively, propose
new wording that clarifies your position. Given the strong possibility that Congressional
measures may deviate from the principles outlined in your draft bill, it may be desirable to assert
your leadership and encourage your allies by providing more specific language.

       Your June 9, 1997 draft legislation (Tab A): 1) prohibits the production of a child
using somatic cell nuclear transfer, 2) protects valuable research, especially embryo
research conducted without the use of Federal funds, 3) provides no new incentives for
abortion, and 4) establishes a sunset provision. We believe these principles should
underpin any cloning legislation. The prohibition wording options presented below are
designed to clarify our position.

       Whichever option you choose, you will have to struggle with the dichotomy between
allowing most embryo research in the private sector, while maintaining a ban on the use of
Federal funds with which much valuable science might be conducted. YQU addressed this issue
in developing the current draft bill and might refer to the June 8 decision memorandum for useful
discussion (Tab B). It is probable that cloning legislation will viewed by some members of
Congress as a vehicle for extending a more permanent, broad ban on embryo research.

        The memorandum also presents the pros and cons associated with a clause pre-empting
state legislation of human cloning, and a possible legislative strategy.

I. Prohibition Wording Options

A. Support current language without changes
Current language:
It shall be unlawful for any person or other legal entity, public
or private, to perform or use somatic cell nuclear transfer with
the intent of introducing the product of that transfer into a woman's
womb or in any other way creating a human being.

       Your bill has been praised by the biomedical industry and professional societies for its
narrow focus on the act of creating a human being through somatic cell nuclear transfer--the
technology used to create Dolly the sheep--and the absence of any mention of embryo research.
These groups also applaud your protection of noncontroversial biomedical research and the
                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

     5-year sunset provision. Current language maintains the status quo with respect to freedom to
     carry out embryo research in the private sector under existing (albeit limited) Federal oversight,
     and does not affect nor address the ban on Federal funding for a much broader class of embryo
     research.

            The biotechnology industry and fertility research community have identified three
     problems with this language: (1) it appears to equate introduction into the womb with creating a
     human being, (2) the meaning of the word "intent" is ambiguous, and (3) the meaning of the
     phrase "or in any other way" is unclear. Option B describes a solution for these problems, while
     continuing to uphold the principles expressed in your draft bill .

     B. Refine current language

     Suggested modification:
     It shall be unlawful for any person or other legal entity, public
     or private, to introduce the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer
     into a woman's womb in order to create a child.

             This language is an improvement in that it makes it clear that violation would occur at the
     time of introduction into the womb of the product of cloning. However, the phrase "in order to
     create child" carries with it two problems: (1) defining a child and when life begins, and (2) "in
     order to" still implies intent. Option C avoids these pitfalls/difficulties.

     C.   Continue to support the principles in the existing bill, but clarify its scope

     Suggested modification:
     It shall be unlawful for any person or other legal entity, public
     or private, to introduce the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer
     into a woman's womb.

            You have been sensitive to the need to be very careful in setting a boundary around
     permissible biomedical research; hence this bills narrow focus. The phrase "in order to create a
     child" maintains that view. However, it suggests two potentially troubling scenarios of which
     you should be aware. First, it could be interpreted that it encourages abortion because transfer of
     the product of cloning would be prohibited only if it was done to create a child, but not if it was
     done with the intention to" abort. Second, someone caught in the act of attempting to create a
     child using this method could avoid liability simply by aborting the cloned embryo or fetus.
     Therefore, we would suggest that "in order to create a child" be deleted.

             This clear language means that during the time this law is in effect, no one in the public
     or private sectors may perform somatic cell nuclear transfer and implant the resulting product in
     a woman's uterus. Today, this is legal in the private sector, although it may be possible to exert
     some regulatory oversight,as discussed in the background attachment. . Some fertility research
     would be precluded under this option, although it is difficult to determine how much because

                                                     2



     efforts are generally made to sustain a pregnancy after implantation, not to perform experiments
     with the intention of aborting. Your National Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended a
     temporary ban on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create child only after hearing
     testimony that a 3-5 year prohibition would not impede medical research progress, as long as
     animal cloning experiments were permitted.       We have been told that the fertility research
     community would not object to this approach.

             The right-to-life community has criticized your bill based on their interpretation that it
     would allow the creation of embryos for research purposes using private funds as long as those
     embryos were aborted subsequently. Option C still permits the creation of embryos, but
     removes the incentive for abortion. While the scientific and medical communities supported
     your earlier version, it is likely that you will retain their support even with this change in view of
     the larger threats that Congress might impose on research. However, it does make retention of
     the sunset clause all the more crucial. Sen. Bond, Rep. Ehlers, and others will oppose a sunset
     clause.

     D. Adopt a more general prohibition

             Your bill is intended to prevent anyone from creating a child who is a genetically
     identical copy of an existing or previously existing person. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is one
     way of accomplishing this feat and you endorsed the recommendation of your National Bioethics
     Advisory Commission in limiting the scope of your bill to the use of such technology to create a
     child. However, other groups including the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and
     Council of Europe have proposed more general, non-technology specific bans. One example
     might be the following:

     It shall be unlawful to create a child who is genetically identical
     to an existing or previously existing child or adult.

            We oppose this approach because it raises many of the same problems addressed in
     Options A and B; namely, defining a child and when life begins. It would also bar reproductive
     technology currently in use in the U.S.

     Recommendation:

     We propose that you select Option C so as to: maintain a narrowly focused prohibition,
     thus protecting the widest possible range of biomedical research while not creating any new
     incentives for abortion.

     II. Federal Pre-emption of State Regulation


                                                       3
state laws restricting cloning research. The industry cites the California Bill as an
example of the type of provision that would prohibit appropriate biomedical research on
cloning and they fear that the political climate would likely pressure states to adopt
unduly restrictive measures.

       There are also a number of reasons arguing against pre-emption at this time. For
example, federalism concerns would normally militate against preemption unless it could
be shown that such action is necessary (e.g. when there is a need for national standards).
In this case, although the industry might be inconvenienced by the existence of differing
laws, there is no clear reason why uniform standards are required. Indeed, in the area of
biomedical research, there is a strong argument in favor of allowing the states to
experiment with a wide range of options because no single correct approach to this issue is
immediately obvious. Moreover, the industry's fears that the states would act in concert
to preclude important biomedical research, beyond the use of cloning to create a child,
seem unwarranted. It is not likely that every state would choose to ban all research
because the states that elect to forego restrictive regulation would be likely, on that
account, to attract new industry. Finally, using this particular bill to preclude all state
regulation of biomedical research is inconsistent with our position that this bill is designed
to address only the limited issue of cloning and is not an attempt to address broader
research issues.

Recommendation:

We recommend against adding a pre-emption clause.

III. Legislative Strategy

       Because the amendment process is difficult to control and extreme amendments may
make ultimate support of transmitted Administration legislation undesirable, we recommend
encouraging our allies in Congress to incorporate your improved language into their legislation.
Senator Diane Feinstein is currently drafting legislation and might be receptive.

Cloning legislation already introduced:
HR 922 by Ehlers - prohibition of Federal funds to conduct or support research on the cloning of
humans. Passed out of House Science Committee. Jurisdiction claimed by House Commerce.
