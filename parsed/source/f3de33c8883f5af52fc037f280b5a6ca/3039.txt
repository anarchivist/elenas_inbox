A. RFRA upheld

        I am very pleased by today's Supreme Court decision upholding the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act. In the four years I have served as President, nothing has given me greater joy
than the efforts of this Administration in supporting and enacting this important law. Our
support of RFRA has been especially gratifying to me because our efforts were joined by
individuals and institutions representing an unprecedented coalition of people with diverse
religious backgrounds and diverse religious beliefs. We all joined together in pursuit of one
common cause -- the protection of religious liberty for all citizens.

        The Court's decision today upholding RFRA will serve as a landmark in our nation's
historic commitment to the principles of religious liberty.

         Throughout our history, men and women have come to this nation to escape religious
persecution and secure this precious freedom. They and others have built a nation in which
religious practices and religious institutions have thrived -- because each individual has been
able to choose for himself or herself whether and how to worship. The Religious Freedom
Restoration Act builds on this tradition and assures that the religious liberties of all Americans
will be strongly protected.


B. RFRA struck down

       Today the United States Supreme Court held part of the Religious Freedom Restoration
Act unconstitutional. We will study that opinion closely.

        Religious freedom is central to the American system of liberty. In the First Amendment
of the United States Constitution, our nation's founders erected the twin pillars of this freedom,
guaranteeing the free exercise of religion and prohibiting the establishment of religion by the
state. Throughout our history, men and women have come to this nation to secure this precious
liberty. They and other have built a nation in which religious practices and religious institutions
have thrived -- because each individual has been able to choose for himself or herself whether,
and, if so, how to worship.

        In the four years I have served as President, nothing has given me greater joy than the
efforts of this Administration to support freedom of religion. We have worked in tandem with a
wide range of individuals and institutions representing an unprecedented coalition of people with
diverse religious backgrounds and diverse religious beliefs in support of religious liberty. Our
work with this coalition has led not only to the passage ofRFRA but also to the issuance of
guidance to public schools districts on the extent of permissible prayer and other speech of
religious character.    Although we are disappointed by the Supreme Court's ruling, we will
continue to work to protect religious liberty to the fullest extent the Constitution allows.
