       TEXT:
       The note below says that

                  Increasing Child Support Collections
                  welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers

       are in the State of the Union on welfare reform.   Does this mean that
       case load numbers and a new challenge to the Partnership to increase to
       10,000 members are not? If they are in the speech, shouldn't I submit a
       short paragraph on each as well?

       Also, by "increasing child support collections" does the speech at the
       moment specifically name the goal of getting to $20 billion in collections
       by the year 2000?

  additional funding ($50 million) to establish public health programs to
