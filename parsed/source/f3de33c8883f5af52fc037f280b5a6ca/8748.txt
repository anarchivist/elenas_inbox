THE PRESIDENT COMMEMORATES SIGNING OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
                       ACT BY TAKING ACTIONS TO
         TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT AND IMPROVE HEALTH CARE FOR
                       PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES
                               July 29, 1998

Today, in commemoration of the eighth anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), the President is signing an Executive Memorandum aimed at increasing employment and
health care options for people with disabilities. He is also announcing his commitment to work
with Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy to pass affordable, feasible legislation to help people
with disabilities maintain their health care coverage and return to work. Today, the President:

Commemorated the Anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). This
landmark civil rights law makes it possible for millions of Americans to participate more fully in
society and to do their part to make a stronger and better nation. The President has also
significantly expanded health and other social services for people with disabilities. Since he
took office, the Clinton Administration has approved hundreds of Medicaid home and
community-based care waivers for people with disabilities; reauthorized the Individuals with
Disabilities and Education Act; and created a new Task Force on Employment of People with
Disabilities, chaired by Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor and with Tony Coelho, serving as
Vice Chair.

Signed A New Presidential Directive to Increase Employment and Health Care Options for
People with Disabilities. While the ADA has been an extremely important law, significant
challenges remain. Since 1993, 15 million new jobs have been created. But the unemployment
rate among the 30 million working-age adults with disabilities continues to be significantly
higher than that of the general population -- close to 75 percent for people with severe
disabilities. The Task Force has already identified actions that the President can take
immediately to reduce barriers to work. Today, the President is signing an Executive
Memorandum that will direct the relevant agencies to:

·      Expand Public Education About the Americans with Disabilities Act. Although more
       and more Americans are becoming aware of the ADA, too many people still do not know
       what the ADA offers and requires. Today, the President is directing the Attorney
       General, the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the
       Administrator of the Small Business Administration to expand public education about the
       requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to employers, employees,
       and others whose rights may be affected, with special attention to small businesses and
       under-served populations.

·      Increase Information About New Medicaid Buy-in Option. Many people with
       disabilities are not able to leave Social Security programs to return to work because they
       will lose their health care coverage. As part oflast year's Balanced Budget Act, the
       President first proposed and enacted a new option to provide Medicaid coverage for
       individuals with disabilities who, because of their earnings, would not qualify for
       Medicaid under current law. Today, the President is also directing the Secretary of the
       Department of Health and Human Services to inform Governors, state legislators, state
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

       Medicaid Directors, consumer organizations about this important option.

Issued Letter That Clarifies That ADA's Obligates States to Offer Appropriate Community
Based Services. A recent court case "Helen L. Vs. DiDario" found that, because of the ADA,
states must provide Medicaid services in the "most integrated setting appropriate" to people with
disabilities. The Justice Department similarly found that the ADA standard applies to the
Medicaid program. Today, the Health Care Financing Administration CHCF A) is sending a
letter all State Medicaid Directors clarifying that states must assure that individuals living in a
facility have a choice to live the community if the right mix of support services enables them to
do so. This includes, home health aide services, nursing services, medical equipment, and
personal care services when offering such services does not fundamentally alter the state
program.

Announce Support For Policies to Improve Health Options for Working Adults With
Disabilities. The President also announced his strong commitment to work with Senator
Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and other Members of Congress, to pass affordable, feasible
legislation that helps people with disabilities maintain their health care coverage and return to
work. First, last year's Balanced Budget Act included a provision to allow people with
disabilities below 250 percent of poverty to buy into the Medicaid program. This
legislation gives states the flexibility to eliminate the income, unearned income, and assets
limits and gives states resources and grants for taking up the Medicaid return-to-work
options. Second, this legislation also allows Americans receiving Social Security Disability
Insurance to retain their Medicare when they return to work, eliminating a current law
provision which often leads people with disabilities to have to choose between work and
health insurance.
