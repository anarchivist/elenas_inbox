I take it from our surprising you this morning that you are to be congratulated!
Welcome back and aboard.
As you may recall, I am on leave from the NEC until the end of February, filling
in for Jen Klein, who is jointly DPC and First Lady staff.  Let me know if I can
be of help to you as you are in transition.
Pauline
