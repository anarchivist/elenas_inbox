                   PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES
           LINE ITEM VETO OF SPENDING AND TAX PROVISIONS
                                             August 11, 1997


BACKGROUND ON THE LINE ITEM VETO ACT

Today, President Clinton announced that he will line item veto two tax provisions and a spending
provision under the authority of the Line Item Veto Act which was signed into law April 9, 1996. Under
the Line Item Veto Act, the President is authorized to cancel tax and spending items ifhe detennines that
cancellation will:

              (I)     reduce the Federal budget deficit;
              (ii)    not impair any essential government functions; and
              (iii)   not harm the national interest.

In addition to the above, the Act requires the President to transmit to Congress a "special message"
explaining his decision to cancel any tax or spending item pursuant to the Act.

The items chosen for cancellation were carefully reviewed by experts at the Department of Treasury and
                                    other relevant agencies. The President believes canceling these
                                    items will not only achieve savings, but, even more importantly,
                                    serve as a deterrent to future attempts to include special interest or
                                    poorly drafted provisions that lead to abuse or serve to benefit only a
                                    select number of taxpayers or states as opposed to serving the
                                    broader public interest.

SPECIFIC ITEMS CANCELED BY THE LINE ITEM VETO

Tax
·     Active Financing Income of Foreign Corporations: U.S. corporations generally are required to
      pay current U.S. tax on easily movable income earned by their foreign subsidiaries. U.S. taxation
      of other income of a foreign subsidiary, such as income earned in a foreign manufacturing or
      service business, generally, may be deferred until the earnings are paid back to the U.S. Prior to
      1987, income earned from an active foreign financial services business, including interest,
      dividends and certain gains, generally was eligible for deferral. However, in 1986 Congress
      curtailed deferral opportunities for this income based on concerns about financial services entities'
      ability to shift income to tax -haven jurisdictions. The canceled item would have allowed a small
      number of major us. banks, financing companies, insurance companies and securities firms to
      avoid current tax on their income from overseas operations. While the primary purpose of the
      provision was proper, it was drafted in a manner that would have permitted substantial abuse and
      created major tax loopholes for these companies.                                     '

Estimated Fiscal Effect of Cancellation: $317 million over five years. (Treasury Estimate)
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
·      Deferral of Gain on Certain Sales of Farm Product ReImers and Processors: Under current
       law, an individual may defer recognition of gain on the sale of certain stock in a corporation to an
       employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) or an eligible worker-owned cooperative, provided the
       individual reinvests the proceeds in certain other property. Gain is recognized later, when the
       individual taxpayer disposes of the replacement property. To qualify for this treatment, a number
       of requirements must be met to safeguard against abuse. While the President wants to encourage
       value-added farming through the purchase by cooperatives of refiners or processors of
       agricultural goods, he feels compelled to veto this provision based on two narrow,but important
       grounds:
               (1)    The canceled item would have extended the existing deferral for ESOPs to the sale
                      ofstock in a qualified refiner or processor ofagricultural goods to a farmers'
                      cooperative, but without the safeguards applicable to ESOPs to ensure that the
                      deferred tax is eventually paid.
               (2)    This provision failed to target its benefits to small- and medium-size coops.

The President will continue to support more targeted and efficient means of promoting value-added
farming that are not susceptible to abuse.

Estimated Fiscal Effect of Cancellation: $98 million over five years. (Treasury Estimate)

Spending
·     New York Medicaid Provider Tax Exemption: In the past, Federal Medicaid spending increased
      dramatically because some states used disproportionate share hospital payments and related special
      financing mechanisms such as levying taxes on health care providers to effectively lower their
      share of Medicaid spending. Some states have used the dollars intended for Medicaid for state
      projects such as buildings, roads and bridges. In 1991, Congress limited the growth in Medicaid
      spending by enacting legislation to restrict the ability of states to use certain types of provider
      taxes as their share of Medicaid spending. Congress required that provider taxes be uniform and
      broad-based in order to qualify as a state's "matching" funds. The canceled item would have
      given preferential treatment to only New York, by allowing that State to continue relying upon
      impermissible provider taxes to finance their Medicaid program. This preferential treatment
      would have increased Medicaid costs, would have treated New York differently from all other
      states, and would have established a costly precedent which would -- if extended to all other states
      -- cost taxpayers $3.5 billion.

Estimated Fiscal Effect of Cancellation: $200 million over 5 years.         ( CBO Estimate)

BACKGROUND ON 79 TAX AND SPENDING PROVISIONS SUBJECT TO LINE ITEM VETO

Under the Line Item Veto Act, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) is responsible for identifying
"limited tax benefits". In general, the list of79 items has been identified by JCT as "limited tax benefits"
because JCT has determined either that (1) they are revenue-losing provisions that will have 100 or fewer
beneficiaries in any fiscal year, or (2) they are transition rules that will benefit 10 or fewer taxpayers in
any fiscal year.

Of the 79 provisions identified as limited tax benefits,
               ·       approximately one-third represent Administration initiatives;
               ·       approximately 40 percent represent provisions that have a basis in sound tax or
                       social policy, or were important to certain members of Congress and were agreed to
                       in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation; and
    changes in law don't unfairly harm taxpayers who relied on prior law.
