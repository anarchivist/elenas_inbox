H.R. 2974 - Crimes Against Children and Elderly Persons
Increased Punishment Act
(Chrysler (R) Michigan)

The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 2974, which is
consistent with the Administration?s commitment to protecting the
rights of victims of crime. This bill builds upon the principles
of the 1994 Crime Act, which recognized that vulnerable victims
deserve special protection under the law.
