TEXT:
Although I'll be starting at HHS on Monday - I'll probably be here for
most of the day.  The Benton event (PSA announcement) is Monday and I'll
be around for that.
- I think Scholastic will be the volunteer summit connection that may be
referenced i~ the speech. (they made the commitment to donate 1 million
books) - Diana will have the final word.

Regarding 0-3, Nicole and I are going to talk over the weekend and figure
out some options for my future involvement in this incredible task.  I'll
get those to you and perhaps on Monday - or sometime later we can review.
Again, thanks for everything. have a great weekend!
