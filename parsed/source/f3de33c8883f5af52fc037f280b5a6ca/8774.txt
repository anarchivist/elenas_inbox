TEXT:
Below is the House Full Committee letter regarding District of Columbia
FY99 Appropriations.  The Committee meets Thursday at 9:30am; therefore,
we need to send the letter this evening.  Please provide
comments/clearance by 6:30pm tonight. Thank you.

The Honorable Bob Livingston
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
u.s. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's
views on the District of Columbia Appropriations Bill,  FY 1999, as
reported by the Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of
the bill, your consideration of the Administration's views would be
appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeD,s support in
developing a bill that provides sufficient Federal funding to implement
the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government and Improvement
Act of 1997 successfully.  Likewise, we appreciate the SubcommitteeD,s
action to provide full Federal funding for the D.C. Court System, Offender
Supervision Trustee, and Corrections Trustee. However, the Administration
is deeply concerned about a number of provisions of the Subcommittee bill,
as described below. We urge the Committee to report a bill that addresses
the AdministrationD,s concerns.

Overall Federal Funding

        The Subcommittee bill is approximately $62 million less than the
$491 million request and the House 302(b) allocation for the
Subcommittee. The Administration is deeply concerned that this level will
deny the citizens of the District needed support and services and
opportunities for economic development.  We strongly urge the Committee to
appropriate this funding for its intended purpose -- to support the
economic revitalization of the District of Columbia.

Economic Development Initiative

        The Administration has requested $100 million for an economic
development initiative in the District of Columbia:  $50 million to
capitalize the locally-chartered National Capital Revitalization
Corporation (NCRC), $25 million for critically needed management reforms
authorized by the Revitalization Act and related to the city's economic
development infrastructure, and $25 million for Metrorail improvements
that would support the Washington Convention Center project.  We regret
that the Subcommittee has provided only $1 million to support economic
development in the District. The Administration strongly urges the
Committee to appropriate additional resources for economic development in


order to provide funding closer to the President's request.

Public Education System

        The Administration appreciates the SubcommitteeD,s full support of
charter schools and public schools in the District and supports the
SubcommitteeO,s appropriation of $20.4 million in Federal funding for D.C.
charter schools.

        The Administration understands that an amendment may be offered
that would provide for the use of private school vouchers in the
District. We would strongly oppose any legislation allowing the use of
Federal taxpayer funds for private school vouchers.   Instead of investing
additional resources in public schools, vouchers would allow a few
selected students to attend privat"e schools and would draw resources and
attention away from the hard work of reforming public schools that serve
the overwhelming majority of D.C. students.   Establishing a private school
voucher system in the NationO,s Capital would set a dangerous precedent
for using Federal taxpayer funds for schools that are not accountable to
the public.  If such an amendment were adopted and included in the bill
presented to the President, his senior advisers would recommend that the
President veto the bill.

Abortion

        The Administration strongly opposes the abortion language of the
Subcommittee bill, which would prohibit the use of both Federal and
District funds to pay for abortions except in those cases where the life
of the mother is endangered or in situations involving rape or incest.
The Administration continues to view the prohibition on the use of local
funds as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the District and
would support an amendment, if offered, to strike this prohibition.

 Micromanagement

        The Administration opposes the provisions of the Subcommittee bill
that would further restrict or otherwise condition management of the
District Government, thereby undercutting the Financial Responsibility and
Management Assistance Authority's (the Authority's) oversight and
responsibility for the District's budget and financial condition.
Specifically, the Administration opposes provisions of the bill that would
prohibit the use of local funds to pay the salary or expenses of an
officer or employee of the Authority who has not provided a monthly
statement of the balance of each Authority account to the Chief Financial
Officer of the District of Columbia, as required.

        In addition, the Administration is concerned about provisions that
would undermine the responsibilities of the Superintendent of the District
of Columbia Public Schools, including a provision that would prohibit the
use of local funds to pay the salaries of public school officials or
employees who provide false enrollment or attendance information, and a
provision that would prohibit the use of local funds for pay raises for
District of Columbia public school teachers who have not passed competency
tests in literacy, communications, and subject matter skills.

        The Administration is committed to working with the House to
produce a bill that will assist the District in its continued efforts
toward financial recovery.   We look forward to working with the House to
address our mutual concerns.

                                                Jacob J. Lew
                                                Acting Director




Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Bob Livingston,
The Honorable ,David R. Obey, The Honorable Charles H. Taylor,
and The Honorable James P. Moran
