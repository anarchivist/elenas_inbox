TEXT:
         Today, I want to talk about how we as a nation must respond to the
new challenges facing families in the new economy. We must reshape our
institutions in ways that give parents more time with their children. No
government can raise a child. Mothers and fathers do.    But we have a duty
to help parents -- to give them the tools they need to meet their
responsibilities at home and work; and to pass on their values to their
children.

***
        The vast majority of todayD,s parents are doing everything they can
to give their children whole and happy childhoods. But no matter how hard
they try, they worry that it is still not enough. They worry that waking
up early and staying up late to make time for a child might not be enough,
when that child still has to go home alone to an empty house after
school. They worry that all those Sunday morning sermons about a world of
love might not be enough, .when the movies their children watch, the music
they listen to, the video games they play show a world of hate and
violence. They worry that all those nights working overtime to buy a
computer so that a child can visit some of the worldD,s finest libraries on
the Internet might not be enough, when that same Internet can also lead
them to recipes for pipe bombs and explosives.

        We must think bigger. On the eve of the 21st Century, we should
set a goal that all working Americans can take the time they need to care
.,

     for their families without losing the income they need to support their
     families.   Americans must have paid family leave.
