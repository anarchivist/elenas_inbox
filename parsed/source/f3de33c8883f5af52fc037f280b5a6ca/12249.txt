TEXT:
Yesterday, CA Gov. Gray Davis decided not to appeal a lower federal court
ruling finding Prop. 187 unconstitutional and has requested the 9th
circuit for to mediate an agreement between the parties.    This decision
has been met by mixed reviews in California and confusion.

When the Proposition 187 was considered by California voters, the
Administration opposed this proposition but since it has been challenged
in Federal Court, my understanding is that the Administration had not made
an public statements on the case.

I assume we will be asked for a press guidance this so I am trying to get
more information.

Please let me know if you have any questions.    Thanks
