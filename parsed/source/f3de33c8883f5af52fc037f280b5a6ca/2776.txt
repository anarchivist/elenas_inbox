     Esteemed DPC Colleagues:

     Boy; if this is an opening to hit us on the drug issue, imagine what he'll
     say when our crack recommendations come out.  Maybe he'll point out that
     our recs will reduce sentences for the same criminals to whom he's trying
     to give life and death sentences (100 "dosage units").

     Just a thought ...

     GGingrich disappointed by Clinton silence on drugs


    WASHINGTON (AP)     House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Wednesday he
was disappointed that President Clinton didn't appeal to young
people to stay away from drugs during an appearance on cable
television this week.
    Gingrich, R-Ga., who talks often about his desire for a
drug-free society, said Clinton's "casual disregard"     in the
hour-long documentary Tuesday night on the VH1 music channel was
"an opportunity wasted."
    He said teen drug use has more than doubled since 1992.
    "Silence sends a message, " Gingrich wrote Wednesday in a
letter to Clinton. "And your silence on teen drug use        sent a
powerful, unintended message to young people that drug use isn't
that big a deal."
    The program, "Bill Clinton: Rock 'n' Roll President,"     featured
the 50-year-old Clinton musing about his life and the music in it.
    White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Gingrich "well knows
the president's commitments on discouraging drug use among young
people"  and that the speaker's letter may have been written by an
"overeager staffer."
    He also said VH1 is geared to an audience that is older than
most viewers of MTV, another music-based cable television channel.
    "When the president was most recently on MTV, he had a lot to
say about drugs and drug use, " McCurry said. "He has been talking
frequently and often about the importance of discouraging drug use
among younger people. ' ,
    Last month, Clinton rebuked the fashion industry for
advertisements that feature models who appear to be strung out on
heroin.
    But Gingrich recalled Clinton's 1992 campaign appearance on MTV,
when he joked about smoking marijuana in college, and suggested
that was reason enough to make an anti-drug appeal in this latest
cable appearance.
    "You did not say a single word about the tragic consequences of
drug use, or the terrible toll drugs have taken on music stars,
from the overdoses of the 1960s to the current heroin fad in the
entertainment industry, " he said. "Your casual disregard for the
issue was an opportunity wasted. ' ,
