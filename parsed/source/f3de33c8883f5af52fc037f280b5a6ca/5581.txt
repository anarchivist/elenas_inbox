Bruce -- just a quick FYI -- I just spoke with Deputy Associate Attorney
General John Dwyer, who oversees the COPS program; he asked me to pass on
a message from the A.G. to Ron and the VP (since we are doing an
announcement of some new cops this week) that we may never reach 100,000
cops. He says interest in the cops at the local level has been waning
steadily, and Congress hasn't been that coperative in finding ways to make
them more attractive. Therefore, according to Dwyer, we may simply max
out at about 70,000 and declare victory.

Ron and I thought you should be aware of this, since you may not agree
with this approach ...   If you want to inquire at DoJ, Dwyer's number is
514-4969 ... (or I can speak tq him further if you want)
