TEXT:
I called Dick Atkinson this evening, to follow-up the conversation the two
of you had Monday morning, and armed with the information in Karen's
e-mail.

Dick was out of town today, and will call me back tomorrow.

I'm not at all convinced that we should embrace his idea, but I think its
worth talking to him and then figuring out where we are.
