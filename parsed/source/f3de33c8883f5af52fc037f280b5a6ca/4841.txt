TEXT:
Karen Tramontano makes two good points in her memo. It seems to me easy to
make the connection between quality and child care providers -- it's
implicit in the policy aspect that encourages them to use Pell grants to
get more educaiton, etc;· we just need to be mroe conscious. to make it
explicit.

   About the "Business Council" Is this modeled after the Colorado effort
? Is that what they called it  ? I wonder if we could find a more
inclusive name like "Leadership Council " --mostly business with one labor
leader, maybe one other ??
   I do realize- I think - that the purpose is to get business to take
responsibility to do more. But we don't mean to send the signal that labor
is irrelevant or of no value. . Here is an area where they are eager to be
supportive partners with us in achieving the common goal --increasing
access to child care . I hope we can give a positive response .
