TEXT:
Karen finally reported back to me on her and John's thinking on the FICA
notice.  It's a bit ominous. She said John wanted to hold off because it
would seem too precipitous to go ahead now after the bad conference call
on Monday.  She said he was not prej udging what we will do. When I asked
her how long they were picturing, she said she doesn't know, but John said
we should sit with it.

She also said Shea thinks that his side had the better arguments in the
call with Treasury, and she wants to check in with him to see what next
steps he is expecting, but she doesn't want to raise his expectations in
such a call.
