TEXT:
Elena, you suggested asking AZ if they would agree to limit their demo so
that no eligibility determination functions would be privatized, along the
lines of the Texas compromise proposal.  Yvette's response to that is that
they wouldn't even need a demo to do that, and so they are not inclined to
ask the "question. I didn't get the sense that you felt strongly about
adding this question, so I am not pushing them to add it. The letter is
going out Thursday or Friday.
