TEXT:
As part of the partnership's next board meeting on 9/15, they are trying
to arrange a meeting with House R leadership to reinforce their bipartisan
credentials and strengthen their ties on the Hill. Bob McArthur, the new
COO, just wanted to let us know that extension of WOTC will be one of the
issues on the agenda.  I told them we also supported extension, and had it
as part of our FY 99 budget proposal.
