Elena--

please review the attached press one-pager.  I'm getting the final version of
the Families' Guide to the 1997 Education Tax Cuts from ED and will forward
that soon.  I'll ask Allison to bring over a copy of the handbook on Getting
Ready for College Early. That will round out the package for tomorrow.

Thanks.

 The following is a HEX DUMP:
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                 Tax Cuts to Make College and Lifelong Learning More Affordable;
                    Helping Students and Families Get Ready for College Early
                                    DRAFT -- August 16, 1997

        We must make the thirteenth and fourteenth years of education -- at least two years of college --
       just as universal in America by the 21st Century as a high school education is today, and we must
       open the doors to all Americans.
                                                  -- President Bill Clinton
                                                      State of the Union Address, February 4, 1997

Today, as students prepare to head back to school, President Clinton encouraged families to take
advantage of the new higher education opportunities contained in the historic balanced budget legislation.
He also urged students and their parents to accept responsibility for preparing for college early, by
choosing tough courses and working hard in school, beginning in students' middle school and junior high
school years. To help families map out a bright future, the President released a new handbook on getting
ready for college early, and a parents' guide to the new education tax cuts.

WHILE MORE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO COLLEGE, TOO MANY OTHERS MISS THE
BENEFITS OF A POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. In 1996, sixty-five percent of high school
graduates were attending college by the following fall, an all-time high. Yet far too many of our young
people still lack a college education or advanced training, limiting their ability to prosper in the 21 st
Century knowledge economy. College graduates are half as likely to be unemployed as high school
graduates. Moreover, on average, a college graduate will earn $600,000 more over the course of a
lifetime than a high school graduate -- and this gap is widening. Someone with an associate degree
from a two year college earns more than a high school graduate, as well.

THE NEWTAX CUTS SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT WILL HELP MAKE COLLEGE MORE
AFFORDABLE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. President Clinton's new Hope Scholarship
makes the first two years of college universally available, providing students with a tax credit of up to
$1,500 -- about the same as the average tuition at a local community college. Moreover, college juniors
and seniors, as well as graduate and professional students, and adults who want to go back to school, will
be eligible for a lifetime learning tax credit worth 20% of the first $5,000 of tuition and fees through the
year 2002 (and 20% of the first $10,000 beginning in 2003). The new law also allows parents and
grandparents to make penalty-free withdrawals from their IRAs to pay for higher education expenses, and
enables them to open a new education IRA where they can invest $500 per child every year to build up
money, tax free, for college. In addition to the tax cuts, the balanced budget agreement also provides the
largest Pell Grant increase in two decades, as sought by the President; Congress must fulfill this promise
next month.

STUDENTS SHOULD BEGIN PREPARING FOR COLLEGE EARLY BY TAKING TOUGH
COURSES IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL. Students who take algebra and geometry
by the end of eighth and ninth grades are much more likely to go on to college than students who don't;
in a national study, only 26 percent of low-income students who did not take geometry went on to
college, compared with 71 percent of those who did. Back to School is an ideal time for parents to talk
with teachers, principals, and guidance counselors to make sure students sign up for a rigorous classes
that will keep them on track for college. A new handbook, Getting Ready for College Early, will help
parents of students in middle school and junior high with choosing courses and other basics of college
planning -- like where to fmd out how much college really costs and what resources are available make
college affordable. Getting Ready for College Early, plus A Families' Guide to the 1997 Education Tax
Cuts, are both available free of charge from the U.S. Department of Education by calling
l-gOO-USA-LEARN.
