LETTER TO CONFEREES TO BE SENT TO EACH HOUSE AND SENATE CONFEREE.
CONSIDER WHETHER, SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH CONFEREE LETTER, THE WHITE HOUSE
SHOULD RELEASE SHORT STATEMENT FROM PRESIDENT PRAISING SENATE VOTE AS A
RESOUNDING CALL FOR MODERATION AND URGING CONFEREES TO ADOPT SENATE
APPROACH.


September 28, 1998 -- DRAFT

Dear


        I write to share the AdministrationD,s views on H.R. 3150 and S.
1301 -- the two bankruptcy reform bills before the conference committee.

        The President shares the CongressD, concern about the sharp
increase in consumer bankruptcy filings -- an especially puzzling increase
in the face of our extraordinarily strong economy. However, the President
rejects any attempt to scapegoat American consumers.  There is evidence of
abuse by both debtors and creditors, but many others factors also may be
involved in the stark rise in bankruptcies. The President hopes we can
avoid finger pointing and instead focus on completing a bill that will
best serve the American people.

        The American people will be best served by reform that is both
balanced and moderate -- addressing the abuses of both creditors and
debtors, making prudent, well conceived improvements to our Bankrutpcy
system, and protecting and enhancing the collection of debtors~", child
support and alimony in the context of bankruptcy. Thus, essential reforms
contained in the Senate bill include:

         a discretionary approach to, and higher thresholds for, shifting
borrowers from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13;
         new nondischargeable debts limited only to debts incurred with an
intent to defraud or for luxuries immediately pre~eding bankruptcy;


         adequate protection against coercive reaffirmations; and
         disclosure requirements to ensure that consumers receive the
information they need to manage their budgets.

        The extraordinary bipartisan support for the Senate bill was a
unified endorsement of balance and moderation.  Unfortunately, the House
bill fails to meet this standard.  If the House bill were sent to the
President, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.

        The Administration cannot support a bill that includes a rigid and
arbitrary approach to determining whether a debtor can use Chapter 7 or
must establish a repayment plan under Chapter 13. We should deny access
to Chapter 7 only to those who genuinely have the capacity to repay a
portion of the debts successfully under a Chapter 13 plan. Thus,
bankruptcy courts must have discretion to consider the specific
circumstances of a debtor in bankruptcy, and the thresholds they consider
should be high enough to ensure that only those with a strong likelihood
of success are affected.  If we deny access to Chapter 7 to the wrong
debtors, and those debtors fail to complete required repayment plans, they
will return to Chapter 7 with a diminished ability to repay their
nondischarged debt -- including child support and alimony.

        The Administration does agree that a creditor should be permitted
to bring a motion under Section 707(b) to ask the court to determine
whether a debtor has the capacity to repay, provided that protections
against coercive reaffirmations are included in the bill. However, the
Administration cannot support a bill that allows unrestricted creditor
motions based on traditional 707(b) allegations of abuse, which may be
more subjective than a test for oneD,s capacity to repay.  Allowing these
motions could make more unequal the balance of power and information
between creditor and debtor, especially for lower income debtors who would
have the least power to defend themselves against unjustified motions.

        The Administration also cannot support legislation that creates new,
nondischargeable debts that could pit, post-bankruptcy, credit card debt
against child support, alimony, educational loans, and taxes.   For debt
incurred to pay nondischargeable debt, the Senate bill appropriately makes
the debt nondischargeable only when a court finds that the debtor intended
to avoid the debt through bankruptcy.   Similarly, for debt incurred within
90 days of bankruptcy, the Senate bill makes the debt nondischargeable
only if there is more than $400 of debt to a single creditor for luxury
goods or services.   Making debt for necessities subject to a cap, as does
the House bill, is simply unacceptable.   [CHECK FINAL SENATE BILL
LANGUAGE.]

        Finally, the Administration cannot support legislation that does not curb
abuse by creditors as well as debtors.  Greater competition and dramatic
changes in how creditors grant credit, while beneficial for many, have
allowed more consumers to get in over their heads.  In response, credit
card companies must give consumers more and better information so that
they can understand and better manage their debts. Similarly, we must
protect debtors against predatory creditor tactics to coerce inappropriate
and unwise reaffirmations of unsecured debt and secured personalty debts
for items that are likely to have little resale value.

        This letter sets for our views on some of the central consumer
bankruptcy issues in these bills . However, the bill contain hundreds of
provisions on which we have views.  We will supplement this letter with
additional comments as the process moves forward.


        We look forward to working with the Congress to enact moderate and
balanced bankruptcy reform legislation.

                                               Sincerely,


                                               Jack Lew
