TEXT:
We discussed long ago whether it made sense to expand these meetings, and
you said it was up to me.   Because of our on-going interest in
transportation and our new interest in housing vouchers, I'd like to add
one person from DOT and HUD, and I'd like to add Betsey Myers from SBA.   I
also want to make sure that the right people from the VP's office start
attending regularly.
