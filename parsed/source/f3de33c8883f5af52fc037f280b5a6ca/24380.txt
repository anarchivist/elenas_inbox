                                      H-2A Discussion Document

     The purpose oftoday's meeting is to detennine general Administration guidelines for H-2A
     refonn.

     Background

             Agricultural "guestworkers" are admitted on H-2A visas for temporary jobs. Under the
     current program, in order hire H-2A workers, an employer must demonstrate to the DOL that (a)
     there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to perfonn the
     services; and (b) there will be no adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of
     similarly-employed U.S. workers. Employers also are required to pay workers an "adverse
     effect wage rate" (AEWR), detennined by the average wage paid to non-managerial agricultural
     workers in the state; provide free housing to workers outside the commuting area; reimburse
     workers' inbound transportation if they complete half the contract, outbound also if they
     complete the contract; guarantee 3/4 of the hours of the contract; and hire any qualified U.S.
     worker who applies during the first half of the work contract. There is no cap on the number of
     H-2A visas granted. Out of the 1.6 million farmworkers in the United States, approximately
     600,000 are unauthorized to work, and approximately 20,000 are in the H-2A program.

             In June 1995, in response to efforts in Congress to pass legislation that would create a
     new guestworker program (without the worker protections present in the existing program) and
     agreeing with the recommendation of the Commission on Immigration Refonn, the President
     stated his opposition to a "new guestworker program." However, he also stated that if the
     crackdown on illegal immigration contributes to labor shortages, he would direct the
     Departments of Labor and Agriculture to work cooperatively to improVe and enhance the existing
     H-2A program.

             Grower advocates argue that they continue to experience difficulties in finding domestic
     farmworkers and that the H-2A program is slow, cumbersome, and expensive. However, a
     recent (December 1997) GAO study ,concluded that agribusiness does not now and will not soon
     face an agricultural labor shortage. The GAO's finding ofa labor surplus echoes the
     conclusions ofthe U.S. Commission on Agricultural Workers (1992), and the U.S. Commission
     on Immigration Refonn reports (1995 and 1997). While the GAO report suggested that there
     could develop localized labor shortages, it noted the widespread belief that employers should
     respond to the market place by increasing wages, improving recruitment and modernizing their
     labor practices. Further, the GAO report cited a study which concluded that substantial wage
     increases would have little effect on consumer produce prices or international competitiveness.
     Many growers blame the INS's recent crackdown on undocumented fannworkers for the
     shortages of domestic farmworkers and their need to rely on a dysfunctional H-2A program.

             On March 12th of this year, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration approved
     legislation, sponsored by Rep. Robert Smith (R-OR), that provide,s for a new pilot guestworker
     program that erodes existing worker protections. In a letter to Chainnan Lamar Smith, Secretary



                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

    Hennan stated that if this legislation were presented to the President, she would recommend a
    veto. This bill was voted out ofthe subcommittee on a voice vote, but has not been taken to the
    full House Judiciary Committee.

            Soon after this bill was introduced, we initiated a process with the Departments of Labor
    and Agriculture to detennine what kinds of regulatory and/or administrative refonns we could
    put into place before the next growing season. We developed a set of regulatory refonns that
    respond to the growers' concern that the program needs to be streamlined (i.e., improved
    processes; reduced paperwork and delay). The Department of Labor and the Justice Department
    (which handles the immigration aspects of the program) have developed a package of proposed
    rulemaking changes that we hope will go in effect by the end of January. However, though
    some grower advocates were pleased with the set of administrative refonns, they continue to
    press for a legislative package that would fundamentally alter the way the program is operated.

            On July 22, 1998, Senators Ron Wyden, Bob Graham and Gordon Smith (R-OR)
    introduced an amendment to the CJS appropriations bill that would make significant changes to
    the current H-2A program. On that same day, the Secretary of Labor sent a letter to Senator
    Wyden stating her strong opposition to his amendment which creates a new guestworker program
    that erodes labor protections for migrant fannworkers. The overall concern with the
    Wyden-Graham bill is that it shifts costs and risks from employers to workers and/or the
    government.

    Issues Regarding H-2A Reform

    Issue #1
    Use of the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
    Whether we would consider eliminating the adverse effect wage rate and replacing it with an
    enhanced prevailing wage rate.

    Current Law:

    Under the current program, growers who employ H-2A workers are required to pay their workers
    the higher of the prevailing wage (detennined by the average wage for the crop in the local area),
    the federal, state or local minimum wage or an "adverse effect wage rate" (AEWR) (equal to the
    average statewide agricultural wage rate). Because foreign workers can sometimes dominate a
    local labor market, this wage depression is often reflected in the local prevailing wage. The
    AEWR partially corrects for this depressive effect by measuring farmworker wages on a
    statewide basis -- thus dissipating the impact of foreign workers on the wage.

    Wyden-Graham Bill:

    Under the Wyden-Graham bill, the worker is required to be paid either the prevailing wage or the
    AEWR (capped at 105% of the prevailing wage).

                                                            Automated Records Management SystelTl
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
    Issue #2
    Employer Recruitment -- Use of Proposed Registry
    Whether we support the creation of a registry system for matching growers to farmworkers that
    totally replaces an employer's obligation to conduct positive recruitment.

    Current Law:

    Under current law, if the grower is seeking to employ H-2A workers, he must affirmatively
    recruit in the private marketplace (know as "positive recruitment") and use the federal-state Job
    Service to circulate job offers to areas where migrant workers may be located. Thus, the
    responsibility for farmworker recruitment is shared between the prospective employer and the
    U.S. Employment Service.

    Wyden-Graham Bill:

    Under the Wyden-Graham bill, growers seeking to employ H-2A workers would have no
    obligation to attempt to recruit legal U.S. farmworkers except through a newly-created "job
    registry." Thus, all responsibility for the recruitment of domestic farmworkers would shift to a
    new, untried, process for which the government and low-wage workers are entirely responsible.
    This registry would take years to create, but H-2A workers could be hired within 6 months ofthe
    enactment of the bill. Further, because growers would no longer have an obligation to recruit
    domestically, they would be free to concentrate their worker recruitment efforts abroad.

    Issue #3
    Housing
    Whether H-2A employers should continue to have an obligation to provide housing to their
    workers. Also, whether this obligation is met by the issuance of housing vouchers.

    Current Law:

    Current law requires growers who employ H-2A workers to provide them with free housing.

    Wyden-Graham Bill:

    The Wyden-Graham bill allows growers to provide a payment voucher (equal to 114 of the Fair
    Market Rate in the applicable county for a two bedroom apartment) in lieu of housing, unless the
    State certifies that adequate housing is not available in the area. Under this approach, the
    grower employing H-2A workers would have no obligation to assure that housing is actually
    available and could be obtained with the voucher.

    Issue #4
    The 3/4 Guarantee
    Whether we support the continued use of the 3/4 guarantee.

    Current Law:


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion       .
    Under current law, workers must be paid for at least 75% of the work contract period for which
    they were recruited, except when there is an "act of God." This "three-fourths guarantee" gives
    migrant workers some indication of their potential earnings and discourages employers from
    over-recruiting to secure a labor surplus and drive down wages. Under the MSP A (which
    applies to u.s. migrant farmworkers, but not H-2A workers), workers enjoy a 100% guarantee.

    Wyden-Graham Bill:

    The Wyden-Graham bill would eliminate this work guarantee for H-2A workers. This change
    will encourage growers to lure workers from hundreds or thousands of miles away with the
    promise of potentially high earnings without any obligation to fulfill any part of that promise.
    This may also encourage growers to recruit more workers than they actually need to hedge
    against uncertainties.

    Issue #5
    Repatriation Incentive
    Whether we support wage-withholding as an incentive for H-2A workers to repatriate.

    Current Law:

    Under current law, there is no mechanism for ensuring that H-2A workers return to their home
    country.

    Wyden-Graham Bill:

    Permits employers to withhold 20% of a worker's wages, to be reclaimed upon the worker's
    return to his home country.

    Issue #6
    Transportation Reimbursement
    Whether employers should continue to be required to provide reimbursement to workers for
    inbound transportation if they complete 50% of the contract, and for outbound transportation if
    they complete 100% of the contract.

    Current Law:

    Under current law, the employer must reimburse the H-2A worker for inbound transportation
    costs if the worker completes 50% of the contract and for outbound transportation costs if the
    worker completes 100% of the contract.

    Wyden-Graham Bill:

    Under the Wyden-Graham proposal, workers may receive such reimbursement from their
    employer, but the employer is under no obligation to pay. This change would simply shift the
    cost of transportation to and from the job from the grower to the worker.
