TEXT:
For next week's radio address on AmeriCorps reauthorization/service,
Gomperts suggested inviting a few (bipartisan) members of Congress who
support the Corporation to attend the taping, so that the President could
say something like, "I'm joined today by x .... " Probably also a few
people serving in Corp. programs -- AmeriCorps, senior program,
service-learning young person.' This sounds like a good idea to me.    Do
you think this is worth doing (assuming we can get members who are in town
at that time)?
