      Attached is an update on IDEA for the weekly. It is longer than usual, in
      order to capture the essence of the bill and to reflect the fact that even
      in this unusual bipartisan effort there are still outstanding issues that
      could threaten the trip to final enactment.

      I do not yet have the information I need for the summary of the NAB survey
      of business leaders Bruce requested. I will get that in tomorrow, after I
      hear from NAB.

Wednesday the House Education and the Workforce Committee and the Senate Labor and
Human Resources committee approved nearly identical bills reauthorizing the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The legislation embodies much of the Administration's
original reauthorization proposal, which was designed to place a stronger emphasis on teaching
and learning and improving educational results for disabled children. For example, the bill
requires that Individualized Education Plans (IEP's) be focused on enabling the child to
participate in the general curriculum, and reaffirms that disabled students must be included in
state and district assessments, with appropriate accommodations where necessary.

The legislation also reflects reasonable compromises on many of the stickiest issues left over
from the last Congress, protecting the rights of disabled students and their families while also
expanding the authority of teachers and principles to protect the safety of all children in the .
classroom. In particular, the legislation would make it easier to remove a student from the
classroom for bringing a weapon or drugs to school but would overturn the 4th Circuit's decision
permitting cessation of services, and require that disabled students continue to receive services
even if they have been suspended or expelled. The legislation would also make changes in the
IDEA funding formula, using census and poverty counts in order to reduce incentives to wrongly
identify children as having a disability (although formula changes would only take effect at
substantially increased appropriations levels).

This week's committee action was the culmination of an intensive bipartisan negotiating process,
convened by Majority Leader Lott's staff, involving key House and Senate Democrats and
Republicans, Administration officials, and education and disability groups, which methodically
addressed outstanding issues left over from the last Congress.

There are still some issues that could threaten final passage -- particularly related to the provision
of services to imprisoned youth identified as disabled (a concern in California) -- and the
schedule for floor action is not yet finalized in either house. At present, the legislation is
expected to be approved by the House on Tuesday, and could be given final approval by the
Senate as early as Wednesday. There is a very good chance the bill will be ready for signature
by the end of month.
