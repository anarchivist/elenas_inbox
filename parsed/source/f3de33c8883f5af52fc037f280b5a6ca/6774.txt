TEXT:
It's a go on Monday, March 30, noon, sponsored by the Center for National
policy.  I need a title for his speech so CNP can get out an invite. Who
would give me that 411? It'll either be at the Hyatt on Capitol Hill or
at the National Guard building the CNP is housed in (One Mass Ave, NW).
Since Carole & I are CNP alums, we are very excited about this
opportunity.
