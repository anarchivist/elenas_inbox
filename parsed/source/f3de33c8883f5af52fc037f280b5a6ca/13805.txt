TEXT:
I talked to LEP about our approach on the bill. He was very
pleased that we were drafting a second degree along the lines we
discussed and that we were putting together arguments against the
amendments that had been offered. He was quite enthusiastic about
talking to Obey and asking him to sit down with us.   I will urge
him to do that maybe on Thursday or at the picnic ...
