        School Discipline

        Q.     Do you know how many schools have school uniform policies in place?

        A.    While we do not have comprehensive data on the number of schools that have adopted
              uniform policies, we know that there has been a recent push by schools and school
              districts nationwide to adopt school uniform policies to improve student discipline,
              attendance, and school climate. Since President Clinton called on the Education
              Department to send out a guide on school uniform policies to every school district in the
              country in 1996, a growing number of schools and school districts have adopted uniform
              policies:

               ·      The Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics estimates
                      that of the 3% of all public schools have mandatory uniform policies, 34%
                      initiated their policy in the 1996-97 school year.

               ·     The 1998 National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP) survey
                     of principals in 10 states shows that 11 % of elementary schools require uniforms,
                     and 15% are considering a policy. Almost two-thirds of schools with policies
                     adopted them in the last two years.

              Moreover, some of the nation's largest school districts have adopted school uniform
              policies, including: New York City, Dade County, San Antonio, Houston, Chicago and
              Boston. In New York City alone, this will mean 560,000 elementary school students in
              the nation's largest school system will have school uniforms by fall of 1999.


        Q.    How do you know if school uniforms are having an impact on school crime?

        A.    School uniforms have been identified as promising strategy to help make students safer
              while promoting discipline and respect in schools. Because of this, the Clinton
              Administration has encouraged schools to consider adopting school uniform policies.

              Since the trend is recent, there have not been any large-scale documented research results
              into the effectiveness of school uniforms. Perhaps the best and most publicized study
              comes from the Long Beach, CA School District's four-year school uniform policy -- the
              first large school district to require uniform system-wide in elementary and middle
              schools. Total crime -- including assault, fighting, robbery, and vandalism -- fell 76%
              between 1993 and 1997. More specifically, weapons offenses dropped 83% and
              vandalism was cut in half. In addition, in the 1995-96 school year, attendance hit an
                                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion

      all-time high (94.7%). While the district does not attribute these impressive results
      solely to their school uniform policy, they believe that it has contributed to safer, better
      schools.


Q.    Is there any evidence to show youth curfews are having an impact on crime?

A.     Last December, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released a 347-city survey of youth
       curfews. In the survey, 93% of cities reported that enforcing a curfew is a useful tool for
       police; more specifically, cities reported that curfews were a proactive way to combat
     . youth violence as well as prevent juveniles from becoming crime victims. 88% of cities.
       reported that curfews help to curb gang violence. All of the 72 cities that had a daytime
       curfew reported that it cut down on truancy.

      In May 1996, the Justice Department released a report by the Office of Juvenile Justice
      and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) on 7 jurisdictions with youth curfews in place. The
      report showed that when curfews backed by a community of support, and are part of a
      larger plan to help fight juvenile crime, they can play an important role in keeping our
      children safe. For instance, in New Orleans, a community-supported curfew --
      combined with summer jobs and recreational programs for youth -- helped cut juvenile
      crime during curfew hours the year after it was implemented.


Q.    Wasn't a study released earlier this year showing that they don't reduce crime?

A.    In June, the Justice Policy Institute released a study which looked at curfews in
      California. The study, which argues that curfew enforcement has not reduced youth crime
      in the state, has largely been criticized by California law enforcement officials, including
      the State Attorney General's office. Law enforcement officials across the State have
      stated that they have seen a very positive correlation between curfews, truancy laws and
      lower crime rates.

      President Clinton believes that useful tools such as curfews, school uniforms, and
      anti-truancy policies, can help schools and communities enhance youth discipline and
      reduce crime as part of a comprehensive plan to combat juvenile violence and crime.


White House Conference on School Safety

Q.    What can you tell us about the White House conference on school safety?

A.    In his speech today, the President will announce a White House Conference on School
      Safety, and proclaim October 15, 1998, National School Safety Day. The White House
      Conference will be linked by satellite to schools across the country and will specifically
      include the communities impacted by the recent wave of school shootings. We are still
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

           in the planning stages and will make details known as they are available.

     Recent School Shootings

     Q.    What are you doing about all of these school shootings?

     A.    This spring, the President sat down with youth violence experts -- from principals to
           parents to prosecutors -- to discuss what we can do at all levels to keep these tragedies
           from occurring in the first place. There was broad agreement that we should be focused
           on tackling the larger problem of youth violence. This is why the President continues
           to challenge the Congress to pass his strategy on youth violence to take on youth access to
           guns, tough punishment for violent youths and gangs, and provide additional adult
           supervision in the after school hours when violent juvenile crime is most likely to occur.

           Today's announcement of a White House Conference on School Safety will be an
           important step to focus on making schools safer for our kids. The President has already
           taken a number of actions to address the troubling series of school shootings, including:

           Early warning guide. Last month, the President directed the Secretary of Education and
           the Attorney General to develop a guide to help teachers and principals identify and
           respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to school violence.
           The guide will be made available to schools nationwide when classes begin in the fall.

           First Annual Report on School Safety. In December, the President called for the
           development of an Annual Report on School Safety, which will be released on School
           Safety Day, October 15. The report will include: an analysis of all existing national
           school crime data and an overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools
           and strategies that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class
           disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local
           safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to help create safe,
           disciplined, and drug-free schools.

           More Police in Schools. In March, the President announced funding for a new
           community policing program through the Justice Department's COPS Office focused on
           reducing violence on or near school grounds. The President later called on the Attorney
           General and Education Secretary to report back by the start of the school year on ways to
           provide even more police for our schools.

           Promoting Gun Safety and Responsibility. Earlier this month, President Clinton called
           on states to promote gun safety and responsibility by passing Child Access Prevention
           (CAP) laws that hold adults responsible if they allow children easy access to loaded
           firearms. Fifteen states have already enacted such CAP laws. A recent study published
           by the Journal ofthe American Medical Association found that CAP laws reduced fatal
           unintentional shootings by an average of23%.
