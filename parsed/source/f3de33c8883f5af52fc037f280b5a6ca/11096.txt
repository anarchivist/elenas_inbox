TEXT:
Is this something that you all would recommend that the VP do. (see below
pressure from Senator Durbin) We could do this as a message event -- but
not sure if you thin~ advisable to do big int'l tobacco message event in
next couple months . . We could also send him to the dinner if you think he
should go but don't want message. I will send you background if you do not
already have.  PLease advise.

thanks

sb

Senator Durbin is pushing this event hard and he has a call into the VP.
Since Durbin is pressing us, the VP will probably need to call him back
soon.

Do you have an update on where we currently stand on this event.
