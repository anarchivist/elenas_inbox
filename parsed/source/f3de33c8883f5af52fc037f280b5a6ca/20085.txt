TEXT:
The President will make a statement on tobacco on Monday at 10:45am in the
Rosegarden.   The Vice President and Erskine will stand behind him. At
tilis point, there are no plans to invite any Cabinet or anyone else.
Please let me know if you think Shalala should be there.

Paper:
1.) I have let speechwriting know that Cynthia Dailard is the contact to
help on the statement.  I think waldman will be writing the remarks and
I'm sure he'll be calling you all.  A draft will be circulated Monday
morning.
2.) I will draft a short briefing memo right now for Elena's review.  It
would be great to turn it in tonight, but can go in as late as Sunday at
4pm.
3.) Do you think we need a one pager? I would think the statement can
stand alone. Please let me know so I can alert the press office.
