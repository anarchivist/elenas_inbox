                  FIVE VICTORIES FOR THE CLINTON-GORE ADMINISTRATION
                                       October 7, 1998

Today, President Clinton is signing into law five major new initiatives that he proposed, along with other important
provisions extending the Higher Education Act. The new initiatives will:
                         ·        slash the student loan interest rate
                         ·        help disadvantaged children prepare for college
                         ·        improve teacher preparation and recruitment
                         ·        promote high-quality distance education
                         ·        create a new model for efficient government

The Higher Education Act, originally enacted in 1965, authorizes many of the Federal government's programs to
increase access to college, including Federal Pell Grants, student loans, Federal WorkStudy, and the TRIO student
support programs, as well as programs to improve teacher training, strengthening developing institutions, and promote
innovation. The Act is reviewed every five years. In response to the Administration's requests, this year the
reauthorization:

1.      SLASHES THE STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATE

Proposal:        "We are proposing improvements in the student loan program that will lower the cost of college for
                 millions of students and their families while preserving their access to the loans they need.'lVice
                 President Gore, Press Briefing, February 25, 1998)

Result: As proposed by the Vice President, the legislation extends for 5 years the new low student interest rate on new college
               loans, now 7.46% instead of 8.25%, saving students $11 billion on loans made over the next five years. The
                 typical student borrower at a 4-year college, who graduates with $13,000 in debt, will save about $700
                 over a ten-year repayment period. Borrowers have four months to refinance their outstanding loans at
                 the new rate. The Administration continues to oppose the excessive payments to lenders and
                 intermediaries included in the bill, and supports extending the refinancing window beyond the four
                 month period.

2.      HELPS DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN GEAR UP FOR COLLEGE

Proposal:       "I also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to
                disadvantaged children, starting in the 6th grade, so that they can get the gullance and hope they need
                so they can know that they, too, will be able to go on to college."[President Clinton, State of the
                Union Address, January 27, 1998)

Result: The legislation launches a new national effort, incorporating the PresidenTS High Hopes for College initiative, to help
                 disadvantaged students prepare for college. Called GEAR UP, this program provides competitive grants
                 to colleges that partner with high-poverty middle schools and the community to tell families earif about
                the financial aid that is available for college, and then to provide longterm mentoring, tutoring, and
                other assistance to make the dream of college a reality. Grants are also provided to States to encourage
                broad efforts to provide early information and comseIing about college opportunity.

3.      IMPROVES TEACHER PREPARATION AND RECRUITMENT

Proposal:       "I will forward to the Congress a proposal for a new national effort to attract quality teachers to
                high-poverty communities by offering scholarships for those ._d:lhmmiistM~rtwllhSS'etem
                                                                                 He".Dllmp Conversion

                                                              Hex-Dwnp CQIlveNion
                 [President Clinton, NAACP National Convention, July 17, 1997]

Result: The legislation includes the Administration's proposals, and more:
                ·         Improves teacher preparation through grants to partnerships-- modeled after the Administratim's
                          proposed Lighthouse Partnerships -- between teacher education institutions and school districts
                          to produce teachers who have strong teaching skills, are highly competent in the academic
                          content areas in which they plan to teach, and know how to use tchnology as a tool for
                          teaching and learning.
                ·         Recruits additional teachers for high-need areas through the Administration's proposed grants to
                          partnerships between high-quality teacher education programs and local schools to dIer
                          scholarships, support, and services to recruit and prepare teachers to serve for at least three years
                          in high-need schools.
                ·         Supports state-level efforts to improve teacher qualitythrough State Teacher Quality Enhancement
                          grants to strengthen state teacher certification standards, create alternative pathways into
                          teaching, hold higher education institutions accountable for the quality of teachers they prepare,
                          and recruit high-quality teachers.
                ·         Strengthens accountability in teacher education by requiring that states and teacher education
                          institutions report on teacher preparation, including their student5 performance on teacher
                          licensing exams.
                ·         Forgives up to $5,000 in loans for those who teach for five years in a lowincome community.

4.      PROMOTES HIGH QUALITY DISTANCE EDUCATION

Proposal:       "Valuable technologies also are important fot providing opportunities in higher education an time
                when college is becoming ever more crucial. ...This is why [we] proposed a number of changes to the
                Higher Education Act that will broaden learning opportunities." [Secretary Riley, U.S. Distance
                Learning Association National Conference, NovemberS, 1997]

Result: The bill includes the Administration's Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnership (LAAP) initiative, and expands
                                  student aid eligibility for distance learners. LAAP awards competitive grants to
                                  partnerships between schools and other entities to: create new distance learning
                                  models, explore the efficiencies and cost reductions possible through institutional
                                  partnerships, and develop innovative measures of student achievement in distance
                                  education.     The legislation also expands student aid eligibility for distance learners, a
                                  goal proposed by the Administration, through demonstration programs that waive
                                  some student aid restrictions to allow more nontraditional students to obtain higher
                                  education, including fulhime workers, parents, people n rural areas, and people with
                                  disabilities.

5.      TAKES AN HISTORIC STEP TOWARD A NEW MODEL OF GOVERNMENT

Proposal:       "We're going to dramatically change the way many agencies provide their services. Today, I'm
                proposing to create within existing departments something we call 'Performancebased Organizations.'..
                · These PBOs would be run by chief executives who sign contacts and will be personally accountable
                for delivering results... Their pay and job security will be tied directly to performance." [Vice President
                Gore, National Press Club, March 4, 1996]

Result: The bill creates the federal government's fimever PEO, a concept promoted by the Reinventing Government effort
                 spearheaded by the Vice President. The delivery of Federal student aid -- loans, grants, work-study and
                 other assistance -- will be led by an executive with expertise in information technology andexperience
                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
     '.
           with financial systems, who reports directly to the Secretary and has new administrative flexibility in
           exchange for increased accountability for results. The Secretary will continue to be responsible for
           setting student aid policy.
