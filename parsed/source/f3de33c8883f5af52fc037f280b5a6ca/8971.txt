TEXT:
I just got word from OMB about the roll-out of the Nats plan. First, INS
 (maybe including Doris) is going to meet with House and Senate staff
tomorrow (Friday) morning. Doris is then doing an event in Alexandria in
the afternoon. Also Friday afternoon, the President will issue a
statement that outlines the plan.   Finally, Jack Lew will call Rogers and
ask for his assistance in getting the reprogramming money ($171 million).
OMB is taking the lead on drafting the President's statement, q&a, and
Jack's talking points, but they want to work with us.

Also, FYI.     CJS passed without an INS reform amendment.
