TEXT:
Elena,
I spoke with Scott Busby about who you should contact at the State Dept.
re: the letter from Secy Albright supporting our conclusion and committing
to continue to work with INS on streamlining, etc.  Scott recommends
Barbara Larkin, who is the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs.
He also suggests that you contact Jim Steinberg at NSC.  Steinberg is
Berger's Deputy, and has very regular contact with both Tom pickering and
Strobe Talbot.

Julie
