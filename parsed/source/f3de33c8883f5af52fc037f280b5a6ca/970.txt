TEXT:
I did not reach Phil before he left for the day and no one in Staff Sec
knows that status, however he may be in on Sunday, so I'll try and catch
up with him then so we can get the memo re: IWG mtg. out first thing on
Monday morning. I also left him an e-mail.

Re: the IWG meeting, I'll be sure to have Cabinet Affairs announce the
meeting on their morning call early in the week.

 have a relaxing weekend!
