                   ONE YEAR AFTER SIGNING REFORM BILL INTO LAW  Hex.~:I'dSMaf1a9
                          August 12,1997 DRAFT: 8/11197 1:15 pm       'IrIfJCOf1'1e~:'f1tSystern
Today, the President highlighted the success of welfare refonn nearly one year after signing the welfare
law, announcing that caseloads have declined by almost 3.4 million or 24 percent since he took office and
showing how the new balanced budget will continue this progress. The President also noted the
continuing success of the Welfare to Work Partnership, which now includes over 800 businesses and
which today launched a toll-free hotline, web page, and public service announcements to help companies
all across the nation hire people off welfare. Finally, the p'resident praised the public-private partnership
growing in st. Louis region, where over 300 companies have accepted his challenge to hire welfare
recipients.

One Year Later: Welfare Refonn is Working
Today, one year after signing the welfare law, the President announced new statistics showing that the
welfare caseload has fallen by 1.4 million recipients since then and by almost 3.4 million recipients since
January 1993. The decline from 14.1 million recipients in January 1993 to 10.7 million in May 1997, a
drop of 24%, is the largest decrease in the welfare rolls in history, resulting in the lowest percentage of the
population on welfare since 1970. Forty-eight out of fifty states have seen their caseloads decline, with
ten states reducing their rolls by 40% or more in the last four years. This progress st.arted even before
President Clinton signed the welfare bill, with the waivers he granted to 43 states to require work,
time-limit assistance, make work pay, improve child support enforcement, and encourage parental
responsibility.

The New Balanced Budget Will Help Us Do More
Because of President Clinton's leadership, the balanced budget includes a $3 billion Welfare to Work
Jobs Challenge and an expanded Work Opportunity Tax Credit to help move long-tenn welfare recipients
into jobs and meet the President's goal of moving a million more people from welfare to work by the year
2000. The new balanced budget also makes good on the President's promise to restore disability and
health benefits to legal immigrants, continue Medicaid coverage for disabled children, and provide funds
for workslots for unemployed food stamp recipients -- thereby reversing the provisions of the welfare law
that had nothing to do with real welfare refonn.

New Tools to Help Companies Hiring Welfare Recipients
At today's event, the Partnership will unveil several new tools to help companies that want to hire workers
from the welfare rolls: a toll free hotline (1-888-USA-JOB 1) and a web site (www.welfaretowork.org) to
link companies to public and private sector welfare refonn infonnation; a guide for companies hiring
welfare recipients, Blueprintfor Business: Reaching a New Work Force, prepared with the National
Alliance of Business; and a public service campaign that highlights the benefits to companies of hiring
welfare recipients and encourages companies to join the Partnership. The Welfare to Work Partnership is
a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization leading the national business effort to hire people from the welfare
rolls. Now more than 800 companies strong, the Partnership was fonned in May 1997 at the urging of
the President.

St. Louis: An Example of the Critical Role of the Private Sector
Today in st. Louis, President Clinton will underscore the critical role of the private sector in welfare
refonn, praising over 300 bi-state St. Louis region companies that are committing to hire and retain
welfare recipients without displacing current workers. Today's event in St. Louis launches the
Partnership'S city to city challenge, in which the Partnership will work closely with community and
business leaders in 12 high poverty cities during the next year to help promote innovative and effective
