                                 STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT


     I applaud the Senate for taking action today to protect our children from drunk drivers. Today's
     vote to make .08 percent BAC the legal limit in all 50 states sends a powerful message: we will
     not tolerate the irresponsible acts of those who chose to endanger the lives of all Americans by
     drinking and driving. Thanks to the bipartisan leadership of Senators Lautenberg and DeWine,
     we can do more to prevent needless alcohol-related crashes in the future and honor the memory
     of the thousands oflives cut short by drunk drivers. I challenge the House of Representatives to
     follow the Senate's lead and quickly pass this important life-saving measure.
