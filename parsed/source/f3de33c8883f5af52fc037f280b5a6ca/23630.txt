MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

FROM:             KRIS BALDERSTON
                   SEAN P. O'SHEA

SUBJECT:   Columbine School Shooting - Agency Efforts - UPDATES

The Department of Justice

The Attorney General arrived in Denver, Colorado last night. This morning
she will get briefed by the Jefferson County Sheriffs' office, the
District Attorney, and ATF and FBI agents involved in the Littleton
incident. At 10:00am (Mountain Time), she will attend and speak at a
community meeting at the "Light of the World" Catholic church.
Additionally, she will meet with 15-20 victims' advocates who are working
with family members and children to provide moral support. The AG will
also meet with the Superintendent of Schools and the Principal of
Columbine during the afternoon as well as those ATF agents who continue to
assist in bomb sweeps in conjunction with local law enforcement
officials.  The AG will then have a Media Availability in the evening
(Time TBD) before her departure at 6:30pm (Mountain Time).

Justice noted that they had approximately $750,000 in immediate support
through their Victims of Crime grants (more details are forthcoming; DOJ
is working with DPC on this issue) ,.

The Department of Education

DOEd reiterated the fact that federal counselors have still not been
requested as local officials report their counselors have the incident
under control locally. Money is being allocated to help assist in funding
local counselors for the long run.   100,000 more copies of DOEd's Early
Warning Guide (found at www.ed.gov) have been printed and are being
distributed nationally.

The Department of Treasury

ATF officials continue to assist in the local law enforcement
investigation along with bomb sweeps.  It is believed that witnesses may
be interviewed as early as today.

The Department of Health and Human Services

HHS reiterates that federal assistance, in the form of crisis counselors,
has not been requested and they do not anticipate such a request for the
short term effort.  Fact sheets are being provided to the local mental
health officials for their use.
