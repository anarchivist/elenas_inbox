TEXT:
FYI- Just a quick update on the Equal Pay MOU -- It is now at OMB after
clearing the Department of Labor's vetting process.  It has not been voted
on by the EEOC.   OMB is holding it until we get over some of our
appropriations and confirmation hurdles.

There has been one slight problem in that Shirley Wilcher from OFCCP
talked to a reporter for the Daily Labor Report about the MOU being sent
over to OMB. This could cause problems on the Hill because it looks like
the White House is going ahead with the MOU regardless of what folks on
the Hill think. We are going to have a conference call tomorrow with our
legis affairs (Broderick Johnson) and DOL and EEOC. Broderick thinks we
probably should give some folks on the Hill a heads up on the article
before Congress is back in session in order to ameliorate any potential
backlash.  I will keep you updated.
