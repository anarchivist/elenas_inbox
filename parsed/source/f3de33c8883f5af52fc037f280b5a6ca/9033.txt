   TEXT:
   Assuming we're doing a weekly item on caseloads (either this week or
   next), I wanted to throw in a few tidbits from the HHS report:  We should
   tell him that two years after the signing, no race to the bottom has
   materialized -- nine states have increased benefits, only eight have cut
   benefits. Almost every state requires personal responsibility contracts,
   and most states have adopted a work-first model, with 32 states expecting
   clients to work within six months.  For the first time, half of all
   low-income single mothers with children under six -- the population most
   affected by welfare policy -- are working, a dramatic increase from 35% in
   1992. State evaluations of welfare programs show employment increases of
   8 to 15 percentage points.  So far, welfare changes do not appear to have
   put nearly as much pressure on the foster care system as some critics
   feared.  A Maryland study found that less than 1/2 of 1 percent of
   families leaving welfare placed a child in foster care, and most of those
   families had already been under investigation for abuse or neglect.

   Andrea, we should talk more about the racial data -- I'm still not sure we
   have a full explanation of what's going on, and I don't want to send him
   something until we do.

                                      WELFARE TO WORK HOUSING VOUCHERS

                    The President's FY99 budget takes further steps to promote work and welfare reform
            through a plan to provide 50,000 new housing vouchers to welfare recipients who need housing
            assistance in order to get or keep a job. Families could use these housing vouchers to move
            closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute, or to secure more stable housing to eliminate
            emergencies that keep them from getting to work every day on time. These targeted vouchers
            will give people on welfare a new tool to make the transition to a job and succeed in the work
            place.

                    The $283 million proposal will help address the problem, in many regions, that jobs are
            being created far from where many welfare recipients live. Currently, about two-thirds of new
            jobs are being created in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in rural areas or
            central cities. The funding for the Administration's Access to Jobs initiative in the Transportation
            Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) will assist states and localities to develop flexible
            transportation alternatives for welfare recipients and other low income workers. But in some cases
            it makes more sense for someone to move closer to work -- and this new proposal will make that
            move from welfare to work possible.

            How It Will Work
                    These vouchers will provide States and communities with a new flexible tool to help
            families who need housing assistance in order to achieve self-sufficiency.
            ·       The additional vouchers will be available on a competitive basis to local housing agencies,
                    including Indian housing authorities. Applications must be developed in consultation with
                    the state, local, or tribal welfare agency and the local W elfare-to-Work formula funds
                    grantee (typically the Private Industry Council), to ensure that services are coordinated.

            ·      The vouchers will be used where they are essential to a successful transition from welfare to
                   work--that is, where housing assistance is critical for a family to get or keep a job.

            ·      Families who receive the vouchers must be eligible for or currently receiving Temporary
                   Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or have received TANF within the past year.

                     The initiative recognizes the direct link between affordable housing and self-sufficiency.
            Along with the Administration's proposal to increase the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, this
            initiative will make decent, affordable housing available to more Americans.

            Current Status
                    Congress has recognized the need for housing vouchers to promote welfare reform, but so
            far has provided insufficient funding for them. The HUD/VA Appropriations bill passed by the
            House provides $100 million for 17,700 Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers. The bill passed by
            the Senate provides only $40 million for 7,000 housing vouchers. The HUD/V A
            Appropriations conference committee is expected to occur after the August recess.
                                                                                                            08/04/98
