TEXT:
I would like to thank you all for taking the time out of your busy
schedules to meet with NCLR today.  I know they really appreciated the
time and they remain ready to work on issues of concern to the Hispanic
community that come up in the budget as well as those that were suggested
by you all. Thanks again.
