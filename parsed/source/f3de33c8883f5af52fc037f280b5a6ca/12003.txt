TEXT:
In preparation for the 2:30pm message meeting to discuss next week, I
wanted to get a sense of what events were your biggest priorities. The
following is a list of events we could do next week:

1. Nursing Home Provisions of Crime Bill
2. Release Social Promotions Guide
3. Release Charter School Study/Visit Charter School
4. Organ Donation Event (I'm trying to verfiy that this would be ready
for next week, although we      may want to save this for closer to
Nat'l Organ Donor Awareness Week -- April 18-24)

Please let me know your order of preference for these events, and if there
are others you would suggest we pitch.  Thank you.
