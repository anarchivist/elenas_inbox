If you had to make room for a tax cut, you could do something like this:

                  1st Five Years               2nd Five Years

Farmers           lOB                            8B
States                    25B*                         25B*
Research                  lOB                          lOB
Public Health                 5B**                       5B**
Tax Cut                   lOB                          25B

Receipts (JCT est.)       60B                          73B***


* State share includes minimum of $3B for cessation, $2B for tobacco
prevention, education, and enforcement.  Remaining $20B is split 50/50
with menu.

** Public health includes $2.5B for counterads, $1.2B for FDA, $lB for
intl & surveys, $300m for ATF.

*** This does not include the possible use of lookback money, which JCT
estimates at $12B in 2nd five years.  That money could be used to
supplement the public health and state public health pots.

If we needed a bigger tax cut in the first 5 years, I would suggest taking
it out of research, or a combination of farmers/states/research.  Payment
caps on farmers ($75,000 per year) might help spretch the farm price tag
out.  I'd rather not cut the state share if we can avoid it.
