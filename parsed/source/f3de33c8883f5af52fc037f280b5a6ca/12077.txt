Subject:         schools

        To give all of our children the educations they need for the 21st
Century, all of our public schools must be safe. That is why I am pleased
today to announce that the Departments of Justice, Education, and Health
and Human Services are launching a a new $380 million Safe
Schools-Healthy Students Initiative.   This initiative will help 50
communities across the country to develop safe school plans with more
school resource officers, more anti-truancy initiatives, and more conflict
resolution programs to help prevent youth violence before it starts.
Working together, we can keep our children safe in and out of school.
Thank you.
