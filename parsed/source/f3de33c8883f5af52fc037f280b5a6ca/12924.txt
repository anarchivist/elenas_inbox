TEXT:
I forgot to raise this with you this morning but Maria asked me to check
with you about raising the number of visas proposed for the T visas from
750 - 1000.

As you may recall, the T visa provision is part of the President crime
bill. The purpose of the T visas is to help vicitms of trafficking/worker
exploitation and to encourage them to report these cases.   DOJ initially
proposed 1000 visas for this new visa category but as I recall from Julie,
I believe that DPC pushed back and lowered the number to 750.   I mentioned
this to Maria but she asked me to raise with you again because she expects
that in Congressional negoitations the numbers will be further reduced.

Since it unclear how many people will need these visas, I think a lower
number such as 750 is better than 1000.   Also, I think it is more likely
that we will be able to get support for a creating a new visa category
that is more limited in number.   DOJ seemed to be okay if we ended up
with a 500 visas.

Please advise.   Thanks.
