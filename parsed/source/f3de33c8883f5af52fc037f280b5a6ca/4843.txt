     TEXT:
     Here is where I think we wound up this afternoon.  I'll continue to work
     on fleshing this out over the weekend for use next week. I've provided an
     abbreviated version of this for inclusion in the weekly.

     possible Compromise Options

     Below are four compromise proposals DPC and ED think we can offer and work
     from. We would put them on the table one at a time, in the order listed
     below, and use as few as needed.

     1. Linking state and/or commercial tests to the national test. NAGB
     would work with interested states and school districts, on a voluntary
     basis, to determine if the reading and math tests used by the state or
     local school district could be statistically linked to the national test,
     to enable the state or district to administer its own tests--instead of
     the national test developed by NAGB-- and report the results in terms of
     national standards and achievement levels. NAGB would have the authority
     to determine the criteria tests would have to meet in order to report re
     suIts in terms of national standards, and therefore whether a state could
     use its test instead of the national test.

     2. Consider 1999 as a Field Test rather than full implementation.
     Instead of implementing the tests in 1999, we would treat 1999 as a field
     test for the national tests, during which participating states and school
     districts would test out the procedures for administering and reporting
     the tests results, as well as the materials designed to inform parents,
     students, teachers and the public about the work students are expected to
     do and how students can prepare to meet national standards. We would
     still seek funds to support state and local test administration in 1999,
     though may not be able to achieve this.

     3. Cap participation in the 1999 Field Test.   We could limit
     participation in the Field Test phase, perhaps to jurisdictions with no
     more than 50% of kids.

     4. Report to Congress on Field Test. We could be required to submit a
     full report on the field test to Congress by a fixed deadline, after the
     1999 field test but before 2000 implementation. While we would agree to no
     more than reporting to Congress, there is implicit in the reporting require
     ment that, particularly :if there are problems uncovered in the field
     test,Congress could act to ban further implementation.   However, we would
     not need additional authority in order to proceed with test implementation.
