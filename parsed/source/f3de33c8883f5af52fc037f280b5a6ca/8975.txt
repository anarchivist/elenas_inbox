TEXT:
Other points they may make:

USDA:    we are already doing this, we have a budget.

A.    There is no harm to institutionalizing it. We understand that right
now   there is a good deal of hemming and hawing -- FDA hasn't even shared
its   proposed budget with USDA yet. That should not be a subject of debate
and   this will make it less of an ad hoc process.

USDA:    This is too sudden, it is sprung on us.

A.   We have been doing regular meetings for months chaired by NPR and
DPC, asking the agencies for examples of new coordination mechanisms we
could promote. We finally suggested this one weeks ago. This timing and
the idea of it are not new.


Other:

According to OMB, we probably will need to make this a Directive not an
Order because Orders they give the agencies a week to vet.  You might
offer that as a "concession" to the agencies who wanted to soft pedal the
council.
