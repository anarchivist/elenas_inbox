MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
FROM:         BmceReed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report


       Education -- GAO Report on Goals 2000: GAO issued a report on the
implementation of Goals 2000, requested by Goodling, Hoekstra and Riggs. Perhaps to
their surprise, GAO's findings were quite positive; GAO found that Goals 2000 funds were
used by states and school districts for a wide range of reforms <£:&, developing academic
standards, updating curriculum frameworks, providing professional development,
technology acquisition and training) that were aligned with and supported state education
reforms initiatives based on high standards. GAO reported that State officials believed
that the flexible funding design in Goals 2000 helped them strengthen state and local
education reform initiatives, and that a number of State officials were concerned that
Congressional proposals to fold Goals 2000 into a block grant could increase the risk that
the funds would not be spent on education reform.

        Education -- Bingaman Proposal for Education Summit: In a speech to a
conference on NAEP and NAGB, Sen. Bingaman proposed that you convene an Education
Summit with the governors to mark the 10 year anniversary of the Charlottesville
education summit and to again set National Education Goals. While we have not yet
determined the best course of action for you to take as we approach the summit
anniversary and 2000, we do not believe that another summit with the Governors will be
either workable or productive. In addition, the NGA Executive Committee considered this
issue at its meeting last week. We have learned that the Republican governors are not
interested in associating themselves with National Education Goals or developing new one,
and that Gov. Carper's plans are limited to devoting some time at the NGA Summer
meeting to this topic.

       Education -- Class Size Implementation: DPC staff held a series of meetings with
the Washington staff of governors, mayors and other state and local education officials,
and with Congressional staff. All urged that the Education Department quickly issue
implementation guidance, and that the Department provide local communities with the
maximum flexibility possible, consistent with the goal of reducing class size in the early
grades, to deal with sucIi issues as space and facilities limitations, difficulties of recruiting
qualified teachers, and the need to effectively integrate these new funds with state imd local

view, but also urged that we be careful not to lose our focus on reducing class size in the
early grades, and that we together work to ensure that local communities hire a critical
mass of new teachers for the next school year. Mr. Goodling's staff has urged the
Education Department not to issue any form of guidance, on the grounds that we will not
interpret provisions of law in the same way that they would, and that we do nothing to lead
the field to believe that Congress has made more than a one-year commitment to this effort.
 We have rejected their proposal that we not issue guidance, and have assured them that
the guidance will make clear that there is at present a one-year funding commitment, and
will make equally clear that we intend to press the Congress to put this program on stable,
long term footing.

       Education -- Rand Corporation Study of State Education Reforms.: The National
Education Goals Panel released a study by the Rand Corporation of education reform
strategies in North Carolina and Texas. These states were selected because they arguably
are the most successful states in terms of improving student achievement overall and
particularly for minority students. They had the largest average gains on NAEP reading
and math assessments from 1992-1998 among all states, and had comparable gains on state
achievement tests. In addition, in Texas minority students made larger gains than White
students, while in North Carolina African American students improved at the same rate as
White students, though Hispanic students improved at a slower rate. The study attributed
success in these states to the education reform strategies that are also at the heart of your
reform strategies, as incorporated in Goals 2000 and other initiatives. In particular, .
success in Texas and North Carolina are attributed to the states' efforts to (1) set clear,
high grade-by-grade academic standards for all students, (2) measure students against
these standards each year, (3) hold schools accountable for results by rewarding success
and intervening in low performing districts, (4) increase local flexibility, (5) and target
resources to schools with disadvantaged students. Finally, while many states have adopted
similar policies, the study credits success in Texas and North Carolina to sustained political
and business leadership.

        Political Reform -- Gore Commission: As a result of our conversation in the Oval
Office, Paul Weinstein of the DPC talked with co-chair Norm Ornstein to discuss the Gore
Report. He relayed your serious concerns about the proposed reports recommendations
regarding free television time for candidates for political office. Ornstein indicated he was very
familiar with your views on the subject. In response to your concerns, there is a voluntary
commitment by the broadcasters to provide five minutes of free TV for political discourse
between 5:00 pm and 11 :35 pm over the last thirty days of a campaign. While Ornstein agrees
with us that the report does not go as far as it should, he feels he has pushed the broadcasting
industry as far as he can without destroying the consensus of Commission members. More
importantly, he believes the commitment of broadcasters to voluntary free TV time will and
should be seen as a major victory -- he has indicated to us that Paul Taylor is pleased with the
commitment of the broadcasters. We believe you should issue a statement on December 18,
when the report is released, praising the broadcaster's commitment, challenging them to act in a
timely manner, and reminding them that we will use our authority to implement the agreement if

Ornstein has gotten agreement from Senator McCain to hold hearings on the report -- to insure
broadcaster fulfillment ofthis voluntary commitment. Although the report falls short on the
education front, we have taken the lead on making certain that public broadcasting will thrive in
the digital era with your proposal for $400 million to help PBS transition to digital television. In
addition, the Commission report will include a critical reporting requirement on broadcasters that
effectively strengthens the three hour rule agreement you secured from them in 1996.(ELENA: I
put my name because I would like to get a little credit for the work I have done on this. Bruce
concurs.)

        Health -- Update on Embryonic Stem Cell Research Issues: On November 14, 1998,
you requested your National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) to consider immediately
the ethical, medical, and legal implications associated with the recently reported creation of an .
embryonic stem cell that was part human and part cow. After discussing the issue at their
meeting in Miami this week, NBAC members agreed with you that profound ethical concerns are
involved, and that any attempt to create a child by combining a human cell and a non-human egg
should not be permitted. The Commission is drafting a detailed response, expected to be sent
tomorrow; they are also preparing to address the broader issues associated with embryonic stem
cell research in general.

        Children and Families -- New Statistics on Violence Against Women: On Tuesday,
November 17th, the National Institute of Justice and the Centers for Disease Control released a
report which found disturbing rates of violence against women, based on the results of a
nationally representative telephone of 8,000 women and 8,000 men. The report found that 52%
of women surveyed had been physically assaulted in their life time (physical assault was defined
to include behaviors ranging from slapping and hitting to the use of a gun). Based on these
estimates, approximately 1.9 million women are physically assaulted annually in the United
States. In addition, 18% of women surveyed said they experienced a completed or attempted
rape at some time in their life. The report particularly highlighted the real problem of violence
against girls: ofthe women who reported being raped at some point, 54% were under 17 years
old when they were first raped -- 22% were under 12 years old, and 32% were 12 to 17 years old.
 Finally, the survey found that violence against women is primarily partner violence: 76% of
women who were raped or physically assaulted since age 18 were assaulted by a current or
former husband, cohabiting partner or date, compared with 18 percent of the men.

        Children and Families -- Adoption Event: On Tuesday, you will join the First
Lady for an East Room event celebrating National Adoption Month, where you will
announce an executive memorandum to HHS to expand the use of the Internet as a tool to
find homes for the 100,000 children waiting in foster care for adoptive homes. The
memorandum will direct Shalala to report back to you with a plan to develop this national
Internet-based registry. The White House event will also serve as the first-time venue for D.C.
Adoption Day, an annual event in which the D.C. Superior Court finalizes a number of adoptions
to mark National Adoption Month. There will be about 20 new adoptive families from D.C. at
the event.
