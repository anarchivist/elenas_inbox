                         JUVENILE HANDGUN DIRECTIVE


    *   THE PROBLEM: KIDS AND GUNS, The mix of kids and guns is at the heart of
        our nation's youth violence epidemic. Guns -- and handguns in
        particular -- have fueled the surge in juvenile murders, Since 1984, the
        number of kids killing with a gun has quadrupled. And teenage boys
        today are more likely to die of gun shot wounds than all natural causes
        combined.       Juvenile crime legislation passed by Congress must address
        this issue.

    *   ADMINISTRATION BILL IS TOUGH ON GUNS.          The Administration bill takes
        on the issue of kids and guns by: (1) increasing penalties for illegally
        transferring guns to juveniles; (2) expanding the Brady Law to prohibit
        violent juveniles from owning guns as adults; and (3) requiring federal gun
        dealers to provide child safety locks with every gun sold.

    *   WE CAN -- AND SHOULD -- DO MORE. Although we need Congress to
        act, there's more we can -- and should -- do to cut off the easy access to
        guns for our kids. In most circumstances, existing law (Youth Handgun
        Safety Act) prohibits adults from transferring handguns to juveniles
        (punishable by up to 5 years imprisonment) -- and kids from possessing
        them, period (mandatory probation). For almost every gun that gets into
        a juvenile's hands, an adult had an opportunity -- in fact, the legal
        responsibility -- to stop that transfer from taking place. We can take
        action to ensure that gun purchasers know about their legal responsibility
        and keep guns away from kids.

    *   THE PRESIDENT'S DIRECTIVE: PUTTING ADULT GUN PURCHASERS ON NOTICE.
         Today's directive on juvenile handguns ensures that the Administration
        and Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) that transferring handguns to kids is
        a felony -- and that every gun purchaser has a legal obligation to help'
        keep handguns away from our kids. The directive calls for all FFLs to post
        signs and issue written warnings with each handgun sold that:

              (1) Make clear that it is generally illegal for any adult to transfer a
              handgun to a minor (under 18). or for that minor to possess a
              handgun, period;

              (2)Make clear that transferring a handgun to a minor is punishable
              by up to 5 years imprisonment;

              (3) Warn that handguns are a leading contributor to juvenile
              violence and fatalities; and

                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


     (4) Suggest that safely storing and locking handguns can help
     ensure compliance with this law.
