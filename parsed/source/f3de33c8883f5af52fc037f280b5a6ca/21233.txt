TEXT:
Here are developments you should know about for the morning meeting.

1. House Dems will be able to offer a germane class size reducation
amendment to the $ to classroom block grant on Friday; no intelligence yet
on vote count; while its unlikely that they will bring block grant to the
floor if they don't have the votes, it was unclear earlier this week that
there were enough Rep. votes to pass it.  In his speech, Riley called for
class size reduction as an alternative to the block grant proposal.

2, Archer's tax bill, to be marked up on Wed. or Thurs., contains a small
school construction proposal--which Dems believe is a bad proposal that
provides a disincentive for states to build new buildings (I don't have
any details on this).  Dems will offer an amendment that will postpone
Archer's tax cuts until after social security has been saved.  However,
the committee dems, icnluding Rangel, are not planning to offer our school
construction proposal, much to the chagrin of the education groups. Apparan
tly the Dem. caucus can't unite around a small set of tax breaks that they
can pay for.


I'll have updates on testing, charter schools, teacher testing and other
issues tomorrow
