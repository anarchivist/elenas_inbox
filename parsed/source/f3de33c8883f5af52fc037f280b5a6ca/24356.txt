 MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

 THROUGH:                       Jack Lew

 FROM:                  Donald R. Arbuckle

 SUBJECT:        Heads up on HHS Notice Defining Federal Public Benefit and
 DOJ Proposed Rule on Verification of Eligibility for Public Benefits

         HHS and DOJ are preparing to publish two documents in the Federal
 Register (an HHS notice and a DOJ proposed 'rule) that will provide the
 framework for implementing key provisions in the 1996 Welfare Reform Law,
 banning the receipt of Federal public benefits for non-qualified (largely
 illegal) aliens.

         The HHS notice presents for the first time the Administr'ationD, s
 interpretation of the definition of a Federal public benefit and provides
 a list of the HHS programs so defined.  To date, programs have been
 operating without knowing whether they fall under the definition.    In the
 notice, only those Federal programs that have an explicit eligibility
 determination process are defined as public benefit programs. This
 definition thus includes programs like Medicare, child care and the Child
 Health Insurance Program, but excludes public health clinics.

         The DOJ proposed rule requires Federal public benefit programs to
 verify alien and citizenship status. The rule is mandatory for Federal
 Public Benefit programs, but is optional guidance for State and local
 programs. Charities are exempt.   The law requires these programs to
 conduct matches with an INS database of eligible aliens to verify alien
 status. The rule would require applicants to provide written proof of
 their citizenship, unless the agency already has regulations in place
 governing citizenship verification. The rule also provides a temporary
 waiver for those programs where written verification would present a
 hardship, to allow programs time to comply with the new rule.

         We believe that as a combined policy, the definition and the
 verification requirements form a fairly middle ground position and should
 be generally well received. We cannot, however, rule out a surprise
 response, from Congress or the field.
