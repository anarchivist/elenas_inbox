TEXT:
One of the very big issues for us has been retaining the rights of local
governments to sue the tobacco companies.  In fact, the first suits were
filed by San Fransciso and others and much of the discovery material used
by the states against RJR came from their suits.  There has been a move to
put in the bill a section that would keep them from pursuing their
lawsuits. This seems unfair.   Can you please keep an eye out for this?
It's a big deal
