STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

        I am calling on Congress to act now on
the timber rider.   First, the old growth
provisions must be repealed. We are losing
ancient forests.  We are losing valuable fish
runs. wild places that people in the
Northwest and across America want to protect
are being lost forever.   This has to stop.
        The timber rider has reopened wounds that
were just beginning to heal under my Northwest
Forest Plan. It has shut the courtroom door
to citizens. This has to stop.
        Second, in addition to repeal, we need to
be able to address a number of the old growth
sales the courts have already forced us to
release. Therefore, I am calling on Congress
to give us broader flexibility in offering
replacement timber, and for extreme cases,
buyout authority.
        Third, we need to take a hard look at the
salvage program.    The salvage program has to
be based on sound science.   It has to meet
environmental laws.   I have directed the
agencies to meet these standards. Yet we have
heard many concerns about the salvage program.
We have to restore peoples' confidence and
their ability to hold public officials
accountable. To accomplish these goals, we
       ,
                                                                     Page 2 of2


      will work with the Congressional delegation,
      industry, labor and environmental groups to
      review our options, including repeal.
              We're concerned that the prospect of new
      legislation might cause some companies that
      hold old growth sale contracts to mistakenly
      rush out and cut the trees.  They don't need
      do this. We will honor their contract rights.
      I'm calling on those companies to hold off on
      any more cutting until we find another way to
      honor their contract rights. And I am asking
      the leaders of the timber industry to help us
      resolve this conflict.
              Finally, I understand that Senator Murray
      is working on this kind of legislation. We
      will work with Senator Murray, Senator Wyden,
      Senator Bradley, Congressman Dicks,
      Congresswoman Furse, others in the Northwest
      delegation, the Governors and all the
      stakeholders to get forest management back on
      track and to restore the balanced and
      reasonable approach under my Northwest Forest
      plan.
