    SUBJECT:                  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH EVENT
    OPTIONS                       (MONTH OF OCTOBER)

    1. White House Event - Launch inter-agency initiative to develop guidelines to reduce
    domestic violence in the federal workplace - October 1

            We are working with DPC, Department of Justice's Violence Against Women Office, and
    the President's Crime Prevention Council on a proposal for the President to issue an Executive
    Order for OPM to direct agencies to develop federal workplace guidelines to reduce domestic
    violence. The Family Violence Prevention Fund has developed guidelines for private sector
    workplaces, which could be used as a model for the federal government. This event would be
    an opportunity to highlight the successes of business in workplace based domestic violence
    reduction, expand public private partnerships and to kick off Domestic Violence Awareness
    Month on October 1. (HHS, DOL, and DOJ have had educational awareness programs during
    past Domestic Violence Awareness months).

    2. Work to End Domestic Violence Day Roundtable Discussion - Philadelphia ~ October 1


            The President's Crime Prevention Council has submitted a request for the Vice President
    to participate in a roundtable discussion with the Family Violence Prevention Fund in
    Philadelphia on October 1. This roundtable will bring together corporate leaders and working
    women to discuss the effects of workplace policies on battered women and will encourage a
    dialogue between employers and working women about effective strategies to reduce domestic
    violence.

    3. The Silent Witness National Initiative - Washington D.C. - October 18

             The March to End Silence or Silent Witness Vigil has been organized to promote
    successful community and workplace based domestic violence efforts, and will highlight 2000
    red life sized silhouettes ("Silent Witnesses") from over 40 states that represent women whose
    lives ended violently. Following the march, there will be a conference to showcase successful
    domestic violence reduction programs. As none of the principals will be able to attend, we
    suggest identifying a surrogate to attend.

    4. YWCA Week Without Violence - October 19-25

           The YWCA's third annual campaign focuses on alternatives to family violence, gun
                                                                   HeJt.Dump Conversion

violence, hate crimes and violence in the media. Each day of the week will highlight
alternatives to violence: A Day of Rememberence; Protecting Our Children; Making our Schools
Safer; Confronting Violence Against Women; Facing Violence Among Men; Eliminating
Racism and Hate Crimes; and Replacing Violence with Sports, Recreation and Fun. The YWCA
has created partnerships with a number of corporations designed to reach communities
nationwide including: Georgia-Pacific Corp.; USA Networks; The Body Shop; Chase Manhattan;
and Sony Music Entertainment Inc. 332 YWCA's will be participating in over 1000 locations
nationwide.

5. National Crime Prevention Council National Meeting - October 14

       The President's Crime Prevention Council has submitted a scheduling request for the
Vice President to address the National Crime Prevention Council National Meeting in DC ..
This meeting could provide another opportunity to highlight the Administration's leadership in
domestic violence reduction and commemorate October as Domestic Violence Awareness
Month.
Note: October is also Crime Prevention Month
