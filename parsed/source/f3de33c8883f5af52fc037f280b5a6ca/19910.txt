TEXT:
Sens. Moynihan, Bob Graham, and Bob Kerrey are willing to rectify Puerto
Rico and the other incorporated areas not being included in the allocation
formula for cigarette tax revenue. Gov. Rossello and Congo Romero-Barcelo
of Puerto Rico want the tax to apply to Puerto Rico as well as want Puerto
Rico's fair share of the revenue and do not object to the application of
the tax for health reasons in any case.
