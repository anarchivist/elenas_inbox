TEXT:
Here are two versions of a draft provision that would amend the State
opt-out in McCain (Section 507) to allow States to opt out if they
implement alternative approaches that are "at least as effective" as an
OSHA tobacco OSHA standard.

The first   version has detail that is drawn from the relevant portions of
the State   plan part of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.   The
second is   a shorter, more general version that states the principle and
leaves it   to DOL to regulate on the specifics.



As a summary, the key phrase in each of these options is:

"This Title shall not apply to any State that, under a plan based on State
law, provides that this title shall not apply to that State because that
State has standards that are at least as effective as the regulations
promulgated by the Assistant Secretary under Section 505 of this Title."

Emily Shetakoff (OSHA) points out that if details are left to regulation,
OSHA takes years to finalize rules.

Emily also believes that any provision that uses the term "opt out" will
be ripe for abuse by employers in States that do not actually want to
have a standard "at least as effective" as the OSHA standard.  She said
that the term "opt out" opens the door too wide (I am not sure this is
accurate because DOL would still have authority to review what "at least
as effective" means, and not allow for an opt-out where State standards
are weaker) .
Emily would prefer a provision that where the State standard "takes


precedence" over the Federal standard, for example:

"If a State has standards that are at least as effective as the
regulations promulgated by the Assistant Secretary under Section 505 of
this Title, those State standards take precedence over the Federal
standards regulations."

While this formulation allows for State choice, this language does not
explicitly address the general purpose ·of the McCain provision to allow
for an "opt-out" option.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

SECTION 507_ STATE CHOICE

This title shall not apply to any State that, under a plan based on State law, provides that this title
shall not apply to that State because that State has standards that are at least as effective as the
regulations promulgated by the Assistant Secretary under Section 505 of this Title.

(a) The Secretary shall approve of such plan, or any modification thereof, if such plan:

            (1) designates a State agency or agencies as the agency or agencies responsible for
            administering the law, regulation, or plan throughout the State,
            (2) provides for the development and enforcement of a standard relating to the issue
             addressed in the standards promulgated under Section 505 of this Title, which
standard
            (and the enforcement of which standard) is or will be at least as effective in providing
safe
            and healthful employment and places of employment as the standards promulgated
under
            section 505 of this title,
            (3) provides for a right of entry and inspection of all workplaces subject to this chapter
            which is at least as effective as that provided in 29 U.S.C. 657,
            (4) contains satisfactory assurances that such agency or agencies have or will have the
            legal authority and qualified personnel necessary for the enforcement of such
            standard, and
            (5) gives satisfactory assurances that such State will devote adequate funds to the
            administration and enforcement of such standard,

(b) Rejection of plan; notice and opportunity for hearing

       If the Secretary rejects a plan submitted under subsection (a) of this section, the
       Secretary shall afford the State submitting the plan due notice and opportunity for a
       hearing before so doing.

(c) Discretion of Secretary to exercise authority over comparable standards subsequent to
     approval of State plan; duration; retention of jurisdiction by Secretary upon determination of
     enforcement of plan by State.

       After the Secretary approves a State plan submitted under
       subsection (a) of this section, he may, but shall not be required to, exercise his authority
       under 29 USC sections 657, 658, 659, 662, and 666 with respect to the comparable
       standards promulgated under Section 505 of this Title, for the period specified in the next
       sentence. The Secretary may exercise the authority referred to above until he determines, on
       the basis of actual operations under the State plan, that the criteria set forth in subsection (c)
       of this section are being applied, but he shall not make such determination for at least three
       years after the' plan's approval under subsection (c) of this section. Upon making the
       determination referred to in the preceding sentence, the provisions of sections 29 USC
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

       654(a)(2), 657 (except for the purpose of carrying out subsection (e) of this section), 658,
659,
       662, and 666, and standards promulgated under Section 505 of this title, shall not
       apply with respect to any occupational safety or health issues covered under the plan, but the
       Secretary may retain jurisdiction under the above provisions in any proceeding commenced
       under 29 USC section 658 or 659 before the date of determination.

       (d) Continuing evaluation by Secretary of State enforcement of approved plan; withdrawal
of
       approval of plan by Secretary; grounds; procedure; conditions for retention of jurisdiction
by
       State.

       The Secretary shall, on the basis of reports submitted by the State agency and his own
       inspections make a continuing evaluation ofthe manner in which each State having a plan
       approved under this section is carrying out such plan. Whenever the Secretary finds, after
       affording due notice and opportunity for a hearing, that in the administration of the plan
       there is a failure to comply substantially with any provision of the plan (or any assurance
       contained therein), he shall notify the State agency of his withdrawal of approval of such
plan
       and upon receipt of such notice such plan shall cease to be in effect, but the State may retain
       jurisdiction in any case commenced before the withdrawal of the plan in order to enforce
       standards under the plan whenever the issues involved do not relate to the reasons for the
       withdrawal of the plan.

       (e) Judicial review of Secretary's withdrawal of approval or rejection of plan; jurisdiction;
       venue; procedure; appropriate relief; finality of judgment.

       The State may obtain a review of a decision of the Secretary withdrawing approval of or
       rejecting its plan by the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the State is
       located by filing in such court within thirty
       days following receipt of notice of such decision a petition to modify or set aside in whole
or
    in part the action of the Secretary. A copy of such petition shall forthwith be served upon the
    Secretary, and thereupon the Secretary shall certify and file in the court the record upon
    which the decision complained of was issued as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Unless
    the court finds that the Secretary's decision in rejecting a proposed State plan or
withdrawing
    his approval of such a plan is not supported by substantial evidence the court shall affirm
the
    Secretary's decision. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the Supreme
    Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title
    28.
