TEXT:
The deadline for pillars and memos is tomorrow Tuesday, August 26 by noon


Please forward 25 copies of your pillar and one copy of the memo to me in
room 164 OEOB.

Again, please make the deadline, as it will greatly help Wednesday's
meeting generally (and your pillar specifically) if the participants have
the afternoon and evening to review the materials.
Thank you.
