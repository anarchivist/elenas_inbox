TEXT:
Medicare Commission Update. On Thursday, Senator Breaux released a
preliminary CBO analysis on the implications of the use of a premium
support model for Medicare. It portrayed the concept in a fairly positive
manner, citing that it could make the program more efficient and less depe
ndant on government price controlling mechanisms. However, it also raised
a number of issues that underscored that Medicare beneficiaries would face
increased financial risk and there might be significant geographic
variation in the impact of this new system. It also reinforced the point
that more details would be necessary to be able to complete a
comprehensive analysis of the impact of any such policy for the program.
This information, and additional information that should be released by
the Medicare actuary early next week, will be used when the Medicare
Commissioners meet again next Tuesday and Wednesday. On Tuesday, there
will be a Democrats only meeting in which many members are expected to
again raise concerns about the general direction the Chairman is taking
the Commission. More specifically, members will likely ask Senator Breaux
to utilize a portion of the surplus to assure adequate financing for the
program, to guarantee a defined benefit package, and to provide for an
adequate prescription drug benefit for all beneficiaries. In the past, he
has suggested that his proposal would include these provisions, and their
absence is making Democrats increasingly sceptical that anything positive
can emerge from the Commission. On Monday, we will meet with John Podesta
and your senior health care advisors to discuss how the Administration
should position itself in regards to the Commission and its currently
scheduled March 1st final reporting date.
