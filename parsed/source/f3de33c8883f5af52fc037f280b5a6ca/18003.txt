TEXT:
Nothing of much significance happened.  Treasury and HHS didn't come. We
discussed House hearings on medicaid next week (Bilrakis) and the fact
Nancy Ann was testifying.  Bruce showed up late and said we should get the
President's letter out by the hearing-- that it would make Chiles happy
and he is testifying. The VP has a 12/16 smoking event in Seattle. We
noted we should find out what money there is for tobacco, especially for
states, in the FY '99 budget.
