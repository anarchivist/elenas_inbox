Q.    What did the President announce today?

A.    At an event to honor the 18 recipients of the National Association of Police
      Organizations (NAPO) "Top Cop" award, the President made two
      announcements strongly supported by law enforcement:

      ·     Expanding Child Safety Locks. Following the President's lead on
            the use of child safety locks for handguns, eight major gun
            manufacturers announced that they would provide child safety
            devices with all of their handguns sold; and

      ·     Scholarships for Children of Slain Officers. Building on legislation he
            signed a year ago, the President announced his support for a bill
            just proposed by the National Association of Police Organizations
             (NAPO) to make educational benefits available for the children of
            state and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.

Q.    What is the "Top Cop" award?

A.    The "Top Cop" awards are given by NAPO and pay tribute to law
      enforcement officers from across the country for outstanding service to
      their communities during the preceding year. This year, 18 exceptional
      law enforcement officers will receive the award for their heroism and
      devotion to duty and service in their communities.


Child Safety Devices

Q.    Who are the manufacturers announcing that they will begin providing
      child safety devices with their handguns?

A.    Following the President's leadership on child safety locks, 8 major
      handgun manufacturers announced their support to provide them with
      their handguns: Glock, Beretta, Taurus, H&R, Heckler & Koch, Smith and
      Wesson, Mossberg & Sons, and SigArms. These manufacturers estimate
      that they represent about 80% of all of the handguns manufactured in the
      United States.
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


      Also. it should be mentioned. that Smith and Wesson was the first of these
      companies to support child safety locks. In August. they announced a
      partnership with the Master Lock Company that would result in child safety
      locks being provided with all of their handguns sold for commercial use.

Q.    What has the President done in the past to support the use of child safety
      locks?

A.   . By including a provision to require the sale of child safety locks in his
       Anti-Gang and youth Violence Act last February. President Clinton helped
       initiate a national debate on this issue. The President's legislation would
       require federally-licensed gun dealers to provide child safety locking
       devices with every gun sold. Moreover. in March. the President directed
       all federal agencies to provide safety locks with all handguns issued to
       federal law enforcement officers.      By October 15th. all federal law
       enforcement officers will have been issued a child safety lock for their
       handgun.

Q. . Will these safety devices actually prevent anything?

A.    A recent study by the Justice Department estimated that over one-third of
      all privately-owned handguns (22 million) are kept loaded and unlocked
      in our country. Other studies estimate that easy access to these weapons
      results in 1.500 child (ages 14 and under) being treated in hospital
      emergency rooms every year for unintentional firearms-related injuries.
      Child safety devices are an inexpensive and effective solution to this
      problem. In fact. a 1991 GAO study estimated that child safety locks
      could have prevented all accidental gun deaths involving children under
      the age of 6 that were included in the study.


College Scholarships for Children of Slain Officers

Q.    Aren't these benefits already available to children of slain officers?

A.    One year ago. President Clinton signed into law the Federal Law
      Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act of 1996 -- commonly referred to
      as the "Degan Bill." This Act provides funds to assist in the college
      education of children of federal law enforcement officers killed in the line
      of duty. Specifically. it provides for up to $4.848 per year towards the cOst
      of a full-time higher education.
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
Q.   How many people have received educational benefits under the Degan
     program since it was created last year?

A.   To date, 52 families have been determined to be eligible for the program,
     and several of these have applied for and/or received the first
     scholarships. The Justice Department will continue to conduct outreach
     to the families of slain officers and inform them of the availability of this
     educational assistance.

Q.   How much will expanding the educational benefits to all these new
     people cost?

A.   The Justice Department estimates the first-year cost of this program to be
     about $780,000.

Q.   Has legislation been proposed to expand Degan?         Who supports this?

A.     NAPO supports and is proposing such legislation today. The proposed
       expansion would add state, county and local public safety officers to the
       list of those eligible for this educational assistance. This new definition
     . would include fire and rescue personnel as well.

Q.   How many law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty last
     year?

A.   In 1996, 116 federal, state and local law enforcement officers were killed
     in the line of duty, a dramatic 30% decline over 1995. This is the fewest
     number of police officer fatalities in over 35 years.
