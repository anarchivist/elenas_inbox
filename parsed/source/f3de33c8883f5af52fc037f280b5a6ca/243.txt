TEXT:
FYI, Bruce's inclination on the waiver question is that HHS should
not present any of this as a final policy, but more ask the states
what they think.  This has the strength of letting Governors of
both parties ask for this flexibility before we give it to them.
Related to this, he feels strongly that the guidance HHS presents
on Monday should be a draft, with a short window for states to
comment, rather than a final.
