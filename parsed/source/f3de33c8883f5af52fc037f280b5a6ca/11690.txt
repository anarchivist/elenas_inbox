TEXT:
BR/EK:

Initial word on Hatch's draft crime bill is that it will include:

   an authorization for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant;
   some version of COPS, but with greater accountability provisions;
   an expansion of the Dewine/Leahy technology grants program;
   Hatch's JJ bill;
   a new project "CUFF," which is modeled on EXILE;
   anti-gang provisions, though minus our RICO expansion;
   a ban on the sale of alcohol over the internet;
   VAWA reauthorization; and
   sense of the Senate on rights of crime victims.

He may drop it as early as next Tuesday.      I'll try and get more specific
info.

Jose'
