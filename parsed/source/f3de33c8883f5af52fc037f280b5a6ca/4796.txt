                        TALKING POINTS ON
           PENTAGON REQUEST FOR SHARE OF TOBACCO SETTLEMENT



    *    The issue raised in the letter from the Pentagon needs to be resolved in the context of the
    comprehensive tobacco legislation which is just beginning to be considered in Congress: There
    are a variety of important and valid uses of resources that may become available as a result of the
    tobacco legislation, and the Pentagon's points deserve deliberation and weighing in the context
    of the entire legislation. The Administration looks forward to considering these issues in a
    bipartisan fashion with Congress.



    *  Although there are many competing options for use of possible resources that could come
    from the legislation, the President has made clear that the chief goal of tobacco legislation
    should be the reduction of youth smoking. On September 17th when he announced his plan for
    comprehensive tobacco legislation he challenged Congress to ''build on this historic opportunity
    by passing sweeping tobacco legislation that has one goal in mind: the dramatic reduction of teen
    smoking."


    *   When President Clinton announced his plan for tobacco legislation, he listed five key
    elements that must be at the heart of any tobacco legislation. The elements are: reductions in
    youth smoking, including tough penalties if targets are not met; full authority for FDA to regulate
    tobacco products; the tobacco industry must change the way it does business -- including its
    marketing to children; progress toward other public health goals -- including reducing
    second-hand smoke; and protection of tobacco farmers and their communities. This is the
    President's framework for tobacco legislation and issues like those raised by the Pentagon should
    be considered in this context.
