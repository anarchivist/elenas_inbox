TEXT:
Where are we on this issue? Maria has asked me about it several times. A
meeting was to be set-up and a plan put together. She recently sent a
memo that she was cc: on to Jose (DPC) that Rahm received from Howard
Berman on the deportation of Central Americans.   Please let me know what
the status is.

I work with Maria Echaveste and need to get a list of the people who
attend the NSC/DPC immigration meeting last week? I also attended the
meeting. My EOP address is 2 FL WW.

Thanks
