TEXT:
Elena,
John Fraser (from DOL) tells me that Sen. Coverdell has put a hold on the
President's nomination for Asst. Secretary for ETA at Labor and is
demanding a meeting with Secretary Herman on what can be done to reform
the H2A program.  Coverdell's interest likely stems from the recent issue
involving vidalia onion growers in Georgia (INS raided; LOTS of illegal
workers found; INS agreed to let them stay and finish the picking; growers
claim they have to use illegals b/c they can't find U.S. workers and the
H2A program is so slow and bad.  According to the Labor Dpt., the company
had rejected use of the H2A program b/c Labor had insisted that they pay
the intrastate average wage of .80 per bag, rather than the interstate
average of .70 - .75 cents per bag).

Kitty ,Higgins from Labor wants us to move quickly to determine what kind
of reform package we can commit to, in the hopes that it will be enough to
lift the hold on their nominee.

I am putting together a short document that will more simply explain the
Labor proposal.  You should have that by Monday am.

Julie
