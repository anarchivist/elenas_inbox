TEXT:
John Kaplan called me this morning to advise me that he would be serving
as acting deputy while Sally is recuperating from her surgery, which
occured yesterday.  Sally will be out for approximately one month. Gene
has asked John to spend more time in the West wing, until Sally's return.
He wanted me to tell you he will need to use Sally's desk temporarily, but
that he will do everything possible to insure that he does not interfere
with your work.  I told him I would pass this information on to you.
