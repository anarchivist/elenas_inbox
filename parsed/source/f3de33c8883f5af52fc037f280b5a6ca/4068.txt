Weekly Report -- 8122/97



        Welfare Reform: Vice President's September 3rd Event: On September 3rd, the Vice
President will hold his second quarterly meeting with the Welfare to Work Coalition to Sustain
Success, the group of civic and religious organizations mentoring welfare recipients which he
chairs. As part of the on-going effort to underscore the benefits of the new balanced budget, we
plan to have the Vice President announce the state by state allocations for the fiscal year 1998
welfare to work formula grants (over $1 billion will be distributed by formula in FY '98, 85% of
which goes to local private industry councils and 15% to states, which have three years to spend
the funds). We also hope to be able to announce a timetable for the competitive grant process
(about $350 million in competitive grants will be awarded in FY '98). The meeting itself is a
working session which will highlight successful mentoring models and include volunteer training
by the Texas Pathfinders group led by state comptroller John Sharp whose effort in Texas
inspired the formation of the Coalition.

         College Students Working While on Welfare: You asked whether it's a good thing to
offer on-campus work to welfare recipients. Under New York's new welfare law, workfare
participants who are in college must be offered work slots on campus, a provision strongly
supported by the City University of New York and opposed by Mayor Giuliani. We think
efforts like these to help welfare recipients fulfill their work requirements while continuing their
education are good for welfare reform. Although it is not easy to raise children, work in a job,
and go to school at the same time, many Americans do so each year -- according to the
Department of Education, over. half of full-time students work over 20 hours per week.

        You also asked whether we need to say anything else on this issue. Along that vein, we
have been working with Secretaries Shalala and Riley on a letter to college presidents which
provides information about how students can meet the law's work requirements and stay in
college. The letter describes how colleges can use the federal work study program to provide
work opportunities, and says the federal government will recognize such jobs as meeting the
law's work participation requirements, so long as the required number of hours of work are
performed. States must agree to count work study jobs as work as well, and the letter
encourages university officials to work with state and local administrators on ways to
accomodate college attendance with the requirements of welfare reform. We intend to send this
letter by the end of August.
