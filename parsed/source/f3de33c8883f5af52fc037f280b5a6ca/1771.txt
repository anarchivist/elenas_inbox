 TEXT:
 Education and Justice finally have agreement on language.  These talking
 points went to the Press Office this morning.  Education is sending a
 clarifying letter to Texas State Sen. Ellis today and is meeting with Sen.
 Kay Bailey Hutchinson today as well.

 As was stated by the Justice Department in its amicus brief before the
 Supreme Court urging review of Hopwood, the Fifth Circuit panel held that
 educational institutions in the Fifth Circuit may not consider the race of
 applicants as a relevant factor in making its admission decisions.

The Administration believes that case was wrongly decided and in direct
conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in Bakke.   However, it is the
position of the United States that, absent further judicial developments,
Hopwood is binding law in the Fifth Circuit.  [In an appropriate case, DoJ
would urge the Fifth Circuit as a whole or the Supreme Court to overturn
the panel's decision] .

Outside the Fifth Circuit, we continue to believe that it is permissible
for an educational institution to consider race in an appropriate manner
in its admissions process, consistent with the Bakke decision.

Q:  A letter sent by the Department of Education to a Texas legislator
seems to indicate that Fifth Circuit schools are at risk of losing
federal funds from the Department of Education for complying with Hopwood
   Is this the case?

No.    There has been some confusion on this issue based on
mischaracterizations of Education's letter.   To clarify:   Educational
 institutions in the Fifth Circuit are not at risk of losing federal funds
·for complying with Hopwood.   Nor has the federal government encouraged or


 required any institution in the Fifth Circuit receiving federal funds to
 engage in race-conscious affirmative action that is inconsistent with the
 prohibitions in Hopwood.  Education has repeatedly made these points in
 the past few days to clarify any confusion.
