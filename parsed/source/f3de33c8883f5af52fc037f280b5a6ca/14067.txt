TEXT:
Jen and Elena --
Chris Walker and Janet Murguia suggested that I clear with you a POTUS draft
response regarding the Indian Child Welfare Act.  Please let me know ASAP
whether or not the language is accurate.  The POTUS will be reading and signing
this letter, so we need to expedite this clearance process.
Thank you very much.
-- Diane

Thank you for sharing your concerns regarding Title III of H.R.
3286, the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996.
I agree that provisions in Title III impinge on Indian tribal
sovereignty, including the right of tribal courts to determine
internal tribal relations. These measures raise serious issues.
As always, my Administration will continue working to uphold the
principles of tribal courts' power, including the right to
determine tribal relations. Already, we have made significant
progress in pursuing tribal economic development, religious and
spiritual freedom, and quality education for Native Americans.
As we work to establish an era of cooperation, understanding,' and
respect I value your active involvement.
