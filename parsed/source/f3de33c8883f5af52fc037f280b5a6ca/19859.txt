                       H.R. 3534 - Mandates Information Act of 1998
                             (Condit (D) CA and 91 cosponsors)


The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3534. Although the Administration welcomes
the introduction of additional analytical information into the legislative process, there are
concerns that the bill creates an inappropriate procedural obstacle to the enactment of
legislation in the public interest, in particular that which is designed to protect human
health, safety, or the environment.

Further, the amendment added to the bill which would establish a point of order on the use
of revenues could delay or undermine funding for a number of well-established and
important programs and laws which have traditionally received bipartisan support,
including airline air traffic and ground safety, the Superfund program, the Senate-passed
version of the IRS reform bill, and legislation under consideration that provides relief to
tobacco farmers and additional resources for public health programs.

H.R. 3534 also fails to consider the benefits of legislation that protects the public health, the
environment, and the American consumer.
