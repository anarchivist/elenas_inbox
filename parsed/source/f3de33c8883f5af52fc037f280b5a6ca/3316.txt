TEXT:
You asked me to e-mail information on projects I mentioned in passing:

1. HHS has begun "Horizons: From Strategy to Infrastructure" a
collaboration among HCFA, Peer Review Organizations and Historically Black
Colleges and Universities to improve the status of African-Americans and
other underserved populations in eight southeastern states. A pilot
project launched in June will work to improve influenza immunization rates
for African-American Medicare beneficiaries.

2. The Medicare Mammography Campaign that was launched by the First Lady
has been operating for two years to increase the number of women on
Medicare who take advantage of the mammography benefit offered by
Medicare. This year the campaign focuses on rates among minority women,
which have been particularly low.  I am meeting next Monday at 1:30 with
Ta Zitans, who is heading this project for HCFA. Anyone want to join me?
