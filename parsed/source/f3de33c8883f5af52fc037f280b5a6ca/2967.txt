TEXT:
From the unsolicited idea department as you follow up on the race issue:
I think Washington should have a monument or a museum on slavery that
tourists visit as they do the other monuments.   I believe some
African-American group is trying to raise money for one, along the lines
of the Holocaust Museum, but they haven't raised much.   A museum on
slavery just opened in Detroit and has gotten very good press. vietnam
proved you can do successful and healing memorials on difficult topics.
The apology approach worked well for radiation and Tuskegee, but now it is
coming under a microscope and people are belittling it. A memorial or
museum is a similar idea, but it has an educational dimension and a more
lasting effect. As such a major part of our country's history that still
has repercussions today, slavery seems conspicuously absent here in DC --
other than through the Lincoln Memorial, of course, which tells it from a
particular perspective.

Just a thought as you guys go forward on this; please feel no need to
respond.
