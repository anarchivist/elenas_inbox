TEXT:
Has a meeting with the Council of Chief State School Officers been raised
at all in the past two senior staff meetings? I know the situation is
different now that the bill has passed, but didn't know if people still
would be supportive of a meeting to discuss the new issues that have been
raised with the Senate version. John Schnur is putting in a call to them
to see where they are on it.

Are we at the point that we just need to tell them it can't happen?
