 TEXT:
 Regarding three FDA reform documents Bob has ciruclated for review.

 1.  PROBLEMS WITH HOUSE BILLS.  FDA has redrafted the paper highlighting the
 many problems with the three House FDA reform bills (HR 3199, 3200, 3201).
 There was some confusion yesterday about the purpose of the document.  FDA
 prepared the draft for Kay Holcomb to share with House Dem. staff before the
 Commerce Cmt's May 1 hearing.  HHS/FDA want to print the document on plain paper
 and give to Kay.
 The new draft is more affirmative about reform generally and less explosive.
 It is still -- appropriately, in my view -- very critical of the House bills.
 Bob will get it to you.  I suggest we clear today for the use they propose.
 2.  IMPACT OF S. 1477 (Kassebaum bill). -- Senate Democrats have also asked for
 an assesment of outstanding problems. As you know, we're working with FDA this
 week to get closure on an Administration position on the Senate bill -- we hope
 to reach closure today or Monday.  FDA will redraft this document once we reach
 closure so WE DON'T NEED TO CLEAR THIS VERSION -- FDA/HHS WILL HOLD.
 3. SECTION-BY-SECTION ON THE THREE HOUSE BILLS -- House staff have asked for
 this type of analysis and FDA would like to get them something.  FDA/HHS would
 like our edits and clearance.
 4. TESTIMONY -- FYI Commissioner Kessler is testifying May 1 so we will have to
 clear his testimony early next week.


Hope this minimizes any confusion.   Call me if you have questions.
