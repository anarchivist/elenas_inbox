TEXT:
Do you have time to meet after 5:00 today or tomorrow morning to talk
about follow-up on the President's environmental initiatives.   CEQ
convened the key environmental leadership in the departments to talk
about managing the Cabinet-level issues, and I need some feedback on how
the DPC will engage on these issues.

Also, Asst. Secretaries are meeting today on Superfund strategy and I will
need to down load some information and get your reactions.
