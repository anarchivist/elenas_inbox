TEXT:
Just FYI, this morning the Corporation is being raked over the coals at a
hearing on the Hill by Rep. Hoekstra, one of their traditional opponents.
Apparently it will focus on management issues rather than some of the
political stories that came up around the time of the summit.  Criticisms
will be that the Corporation is not auditable and that their trust fund
can't account for $20 million. They don't expect much bad press beyond
the traditional Wash. Times article, but they will update me if it goes wor
se than that.
