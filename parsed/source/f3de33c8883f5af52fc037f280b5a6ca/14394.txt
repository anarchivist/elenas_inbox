TEXT:
Hilley wants to meet today at 4:00 to discuss the independent expenditures
issue in prep for Tuesday's sitdown with the groups. Elena, I thought it
would be very helpful if you could layout the issues at a "pre-pre
meeting" ie. this afternoon? say 2:00?

Peter, Paul. Is this time good for you?
