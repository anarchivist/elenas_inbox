 1.     In the "Looks Good" or "Optimistic" category      Clayton, Boyd

 2. .    "Fair Shot": Watt

. 3.    "No": Baesler·

 4. Other: McIntyre has had 2 plants in the district close, needs heavy
 pressure
          Hefner is "more open than expected"

 They have reached out to the farm bureaus and tobacco growers association
 and the gorups are "coordinating efforts."

 They are also reaching out the following R members: Rogers, Bunning,
 Kingston, Linder, Chambliss, Hillary

 They were kind of optimistic about things. They asked about a signed
 letter but didn't push it.
