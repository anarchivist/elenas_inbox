             This is from Roger Mills in Atlanta, about the North
             Carolina testing case.
                                    Howie
             SUMMARY OF JOHNSTON COUNTY, N.C. TESTING CASE

             I.    What are the tests involved?

             They are state-wide tests of the North Carolina Department
             of Public Instruction. There are two series.   One is called
             "End-of-Grade Tests, Reading Comprehension and Mathematics."
             The other is "End-of-Course Tests, Algebra I, Biology,
             Economic, Legal & Political Systems, English I, U.S.
             History. "

             II.    How are they implemented?

             The Johnson County Board of Education Policy Code 842,
             "Student Accountability for Academic Achievement," adopted
             June 18, 1996, provides in part:

             "Students in grades 3-8 who score at an Achievement Level of
             less than III during the end of year administration of the
             End-of-Grade tests in reading or math will be retained."


           "Students enrolled in high school courses with state
           required End-of-Course mUltiple choice tests who meet all
           other requirements for receiving course credit, will receive
           credit only if they achieve a grade of 70 or better on the
           End-of-Course test as determined by the state's scoring
           program. "

           "Exceptional children enrolled in high school courses will
           be held to the same standards as all other students who are
           enrolled for diploma course credit."

           "Limited English Porficiency (LEP) students enrolled in high
           school courses will be held to the same standards as all
           other students who are enrolled for diploma course credit."


           III. What is wrong with the application of this policy to
           students?

           Plaintiffs' expert, Richard Jaeger, Director of the Center
           for Educational Research and Evaluation of the University of
           North Carolina at Greensboro, states in an affidavit:

           1. There is no evidence the End-of-Grade Tests validly
           predict the ability of students to succeed the following
           school grade. The district improperly makes promotion
           decisions on the basis of a single test score.

           2. The policy's implementation has a statistically
           significant adverse impact upon minority students. While
           about 72% of the county's white students pass End-of-Grade
           tests, only about 44% of its Hispanics and only about 40% of
           black students do. A similar adverse impact results from
           administration of the End-of-Course tests.

           3. The procedures used to comput the cut off scores were
           not documented.

           4. While the State estimated reliability using internal
           consistency, the use made of the test by the county requires
           alternate forms of reliability.  Using an alternate form, he
           estimates that for 1 out of 3 students, the difference
           between the student's observed test score and his true test
           score is at least one standard error of measurement. The
           tests should not be used to retain individual students.

           5. When students are retained, they do not succeed,
           compounding the problem.


           IV.   what is the legal basis for challenging the action?

           A. Title VI
           The practice violates the regulation implementing Title VI
           at 34 C:F.R. Section 100.3(b) (2) [criteria or methods of
           administration having a discriminatory effect] because
           neither the test content nor the cut off scores have
           been validated for individual assessment and because less
           discriminatory alternatives exist for deciding promotion.


                 B. Due Process Clause {Substantive}
                 Use of the test score in determining promotion is not
                 rationally related to any legitimate or substantial
                 governmental interest, including the board's purpose of
                 "insuring student success." The use of the test score as
                 the sole criterion is arbitrary and unreasonable in
                 violation of the due process clause of the Fourt.eenth
                 Amendment.

                 C. Due Process Clause {Procedural}
                 State law gives students a property interest in promotion
                 when course performance is satisfactory, and while studnets
                 have complied with these requirements, they have been
                 dentied this property interest without adequate notice, or
                 adequate review procedure, and with a waiver process that is
                 arbitrarily administered.

                 D. Equal Protection Clause
                 Students are classified by test score alone, making
                 distinctions {pass/retain} that have no rational basis and
                 are unrelated to any legitimate or substantial governmental
                 interest.

                 E. Section 504
                 Students with disabilities are not provided reasonable
                 modifications when the tests are administered.


                                                                  --Roger
