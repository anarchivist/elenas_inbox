TEXT:
Here is our proposed timetable for our Comparable Worth process:

1.   This week we are reaching out to Treasury, OMB,  Commerce (Orszag is
now head of planning there), OPM, DOJ, EEOC, DOL, and SBA to inform them
of our process, the idea of endorsing the Harkin bill, and ask them to
have preliminary comments ready for a Monday afternoon meeting next week.
Orszag in particular says Commerce is going to oppose and will have
something to circulate. We are also asking them to be creative about
other things in the area we might do.  In addition, we want them to see if
they can sign on to the data provision that is in Daschle's old bill. We
will get you an inventory of other wage disclosure options before the
meeting.  If any of them look promising, you might ask the agencies to
respond to the option as well.

2.     March 8 Meeting.   Tentative list of invites.

DOJ:              Richard Jerome, Deputy Associate Attorney General
                  Kay Baldwin, Civil Rights Division
EEOC:             Ida Castro, Chairwoman
Labor:            Lee Satterfield, Chief of " Staff
                  Sally Paxton, SolicitorD,s Office
SBA:              Betsy Meyers, Associate Deputy Administrator for Entrepreneurial
Development
Treasury:         David wilcox Assist. Secty for Economic Policy
Commerce:         Jon Orszag, Director, Office of Policy and Strategic
planning
OPM:              Leigh Shein, Chief of Staff
NEC:              Sally Katzen
OMB:              Josh Gotbaum
CEA:              Becky Blank


3. Week of March 15. Second Meeting.    Final agency comments will be due.
In addition, we will have asked OMB and OPM to prepare ideas on limited
comparable worth applications in the federal workplace which we can
discuss
at this second meeting.

4. Week of March 22.   Final memo for sign-off.        Inform Harkin and
Norton.  Hopefully
have wage disclosure idea ready as well.


I guess we should include OPL on our invite list, yes? But I would stress
that they cannot have contact with advocates during this process.
