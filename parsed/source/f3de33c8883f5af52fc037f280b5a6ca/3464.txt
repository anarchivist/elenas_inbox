             Subject:         HEA Reauthorization/clinical programs

             The Department of EducationO,s Higher Education Act reauthorization
             package currently includes a proposal to consolidate several graduate
             education programs (some funded, others not) into a single program that
             would provide incentives and support for u.S. citizens, especially from
             underrepresented populations, to complete grad programs leading to
             academic careers in areas of national need.  One piece eliminated from the
             current HEA would be a grant program designed to encourage law schools to
             establish clinical programs ..

             The Department states that in 1994, the White House intervened with OMB to
             restore funding for the program, but other than that the Administration
             has consistently requested no funds.  It is unfunded for FY 1997 and we
             requested no funds for FY 1998. (A more detailed funding history of the
             program is below) .

             The Department argues that the program was originally intended to
             encourage law schools to establish clinical programs--basically to build
             capacity-- but now all schools must have clinical programs to be
             accredited, and so the HEA funding can be ended.

             ItO,s my sense that most law schools do have clinical programs now, but I
             also have the impression that they sometimes operate close to the edge
             financially, and that a large number have a focus on providing legal
             services for the poor. Especially given the First Lady's long-term
             interest in this area -- both her involvement with the Legal Services
             Corporation and the fact that she battled to get the first legal clinic
             opened at the U of A law school -- do you feel that we need to explore the
             fate of the clinical program more carefully? With the current Congress,
             as a practical matter, it may not matter anyway, because such a program
             might not be reauthorized or funded regardless of the approach we take.
             On the other hand, the program is already on the books, and symbolically
             it might say something for us to make a Higher Ed Act proposal that would
             explicitly end it.



     Please let me know what you think. As you know,. the Department is trying
     to move these smaller provisions of the HEA on a fast track and get them
     up to the Hill ASAP.

     Thanks.
