TEXT:
Tomorrow DOL will release a letter from Herman and a press release about
Cardin's introduction of our welfare to work proposal.  We thought that
rather than include a new quote from the President we should have Herman
quote the President's radio address statement, i.e., --

As the President said in his April 10th radio address, "We can't finish
the job of welfare reform without doing more to help people who have the
hardest time moving from welfare to work -- those who live in the poorest
neighborhoods and have the poorest job skills.  That's why I call on
Congress to pass my plan to extend the Department of Labor's Welfare to
Work program."

What do you think?
