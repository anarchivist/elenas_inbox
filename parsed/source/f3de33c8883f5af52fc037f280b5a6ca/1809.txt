Could you please take a look at the attached and see whether you think

Jim, could you please assign this to someone; I'm sure it could use some

           Draft response to Letter from Democrats on National Uniform Standards Legislation


        Dear <salutation>,

                Thank you for your letter of March 14 on legislation to create national uniform standards
        for some types of securities litigation. I agree that it is an important topic. The new regime put
        in place by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act is still unfolding, and I believe that we
        should study all the available data to see whether there is a need for further action at this time.
        In that connection, the Securities and Exchange Commission [has just] issued a report that I
        asked them to prepare for me and for Congress assessing the impact oflast year's legislation.
        Other studies also have been done. My Administration will be reviewing the data to assess the
        need for further legislation at this time, and we will want to talk with you and work with you as
        we do that.
