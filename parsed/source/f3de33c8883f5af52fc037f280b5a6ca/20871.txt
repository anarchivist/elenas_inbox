TEXT:
Although this is still fluid, here's how the various announcement might be
framed, and an updated list of the announcements for 8/5 event. We
probably wouldn't do all of these, but at least we have some to choose
from.   Note that this is also the 1 yr anniversary for signing BBA
including WTW program -- so we should at least note this in remarks, i.e.
almost 2 years ago I signed welfare reform act, and one year ago today I
signed BBA that included WTW funds to give extra help providing job
opportunities to the hardest to place welfare recipients.

We'd release report to Congress showing that two years into the new law,
more recipients are working and states are investing more per person.
But, there's more to be done as we move into the next stage of welfare
reform to ensure a successful transition from welfare to work for more
people. We're taking steps to ensure those leaving welfare for work have
health coverage, accumlate assets, overcome substance abuse, help hardest
to serve move from welfare to work, by:

Announcing we are waiving old welfare regulations preventing some states
from providing Medicaid to two parent families (100 hour rule)
Endorsing efforts to help former welfare recipients save and build assets,
by endorsing the Coats-Harkin Individual Development Accounts proposal.


Maybe: CASA welfare reform substance abuse demo grants (HHS just put in
additional $ into CASA demo to allow them to add another site).
Maybe: release some more WTW formula grants (I'm checking to see which are
in the pipeline) .


Jeanne/Sarah/Bill--we should coordinate on looking for the real person to
introduce POTUS ... someone who went to work, and continued getting medicaid
due to 100 hour rule waiver. Cynthia and I were thinking MD or DE would
be good places to look, and, it would be neat if we could actually get a
male up there since 100 hour rule affects two parent families.
