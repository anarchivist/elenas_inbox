PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS AT BULLETPROOF VEST BILL SIGNING
THE WHITE HOUSE
June 16, 1998

 Acknowledgments: TK.

 This is a time of great progress in our nation. We have the strongest
economy in a generation; inflation and unemployment are at thirty-year
lows. And, we just learned last month that crime'dropped in 1997 for an
unprecedented sixth year in a row.  Murders have dropped by more than 25
percent, and overall violent crime by more than 15 percent.  In so many
ways, our nation is seeing a return to personal responsibility and respect
for law. And that makes a real difference in the lives of Americans.
Neighborhoods are safer; families are more secure; Americans have a new
feeling of freedom.

 At the heart of this great transformation, this new security, are law
enforcement officers like yourselves.  Police are making a profound impact


 across our nation -- stepping out of squad cars and precinct houses,
 joining and protecting our communities.  By putting 100,000 more of you on
 the streets as a part of our community policing program, law enforcement
 officers and ordinary citizens are becoming powerful partners in fighting
 crime.  ID,m pleased to report that ahead of schedule and under budget, we
 D,ve funded 76,000 of 100,000 community police.  And to those of you who
 are already out there, walking the beat and putting your lives on the
 line, America owes you a tremendous debt of gratitude for making this a
 safer, and freer, country.

 For five and a half years now, I have been working to make the federal
government a genuine partner in building a better and safer America. A
crucial part of that effort is making sure law enforcement officers have
the tools to do the job. There are few tools more important than this one
-- a bulletproof vest.  Over the past decade, body armor has saved the
lives of more than 2,000 officers.   The FBI has estimated that the risk of
a gun-related fatality is 14 times higher for an officer who does not wear
a vest than for an officer who does.

 The line of fire will always be a dangerous place. But today we are
making it less dangerous for those brave enough to walk that line.  To
protect those who protect us all, I am proud today to sign the Bulletproof
Vest Partnership Grant Act. Twenty-five percent of state and local law
enforcement officers do not have the body armor to protect them in
life-threatening situations; and this legislation will help state and
local police departments provide bulletproof vests for those officers.
This is a critical investment in the safety of men and women whose lives
are on the line every day.

 Protecting Americans from crime is, as you well know, dangerous work.
Sometimes, an officer makes the ultimate sacrifice -- of his or her life.
We will continue to do everything in our power to prevent that from
happening, and bulletproof vests are an important part of that
responsibility. But when an officer is killed in the line of duty, we
have a further responsibility -- to the families and children they leave
behind. To honor those lives lost and those who remain, I am also signing
the Care for Police Survivors Act, which supports counseling for families
who have lost a loved one in the line of duty.  Last fall, I proposed to
help provide college scholarships for the children of slain officers, and
I again calIon congress to make that important tribute to those who
protect all AmericaD,s children.

 Community police are making our children safer at home and in our
neighborhoods. And, as recent events have reminded us, we need those
police every bit as much at our nationD,s schools.   Just yesterday, a
14-year-old student shot two people in a Richmond, Virginia high school.
TheyD,re expected to make a full recovery, ID,m relieved to say. And
fortunately, the assailant was chased several blocks and apprehended by
Ron Brown, a police officer assigned to the school.

 Ron Brown was at that school because COPS, our community policing
program, helped fund his presence there.  Our nation needs more Ron
Browns. That is why, today, I am directing the Attorney General and the
Secretary of Education to develop an action plan, and to report back to me
before the next school year on ways to provide more police for more
schools, just as weD,ve provided more police for our communities.   I ask
all the Members of Congress here today, members of both parties who have
worked with us to strengthen law enforcement in every corner of our
country, to join in this important effort. A good first step is to
support the bill just introduced by Congressman Jim Maloney -- to


guarantee that funds from our COPS initiative can be used to deploy more
community police in our communitiesO, schools.  Congress should pass this
bill as a O&back-to-school special08 for AmericaO,s children.

 Our nation is grateful for the hard work of our law enforcement
officers. Every day, you are making our streets and schools safer, our
homes more secure, our people more free.  But as you ensure that our crime
rates drop, the rest of us cannot grow complacent. As parents, as
teachers, as community and national leaders, we must teach our children
right from wrong and turn them away from violence. And by working
together, we will make this a safer and better nation for our children as
we stand on the threshold of the new century.
