TEXT:
I just spoke with Ann Rosewater PS/(b)(S) who mentioned that you had
promised to draft talking points   a would, among other things, provide
guidance to the regional offices about the White House effort vis a vis
the Engagement campaign (especially given the launch of the campaign just
prior to the Conference).

I'm now drafting a one-pager for the regions that lays out the day and the
Conference for their planing purposes. Do you want me also to do these
few q&a?
