TEXT:
The texas amendment was not made in order on the supp, so we dropped
reference to that issue in the SAP.    And the meek amendment that is
similar to the Senate bill to extend ssi payments for immigrants through
the end of the fiscal year was made in order; the immigrant block grant
amendment was withdrawn.   We win!
