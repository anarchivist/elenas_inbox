TEXT:
Today at the meeting in Chuck Ruff's office on the EEOC Federal Sector
Rule, Chuck, Sally Katzen, and Maria Echaveste discussed whether attorneys
fees should be awarded for activities done during the pre-complaint stage,
as is provided for in the draft final rule. .After a brief discussion on
the issue, Sally presented a compromise position (developed by OIRA staff)
which would allow for pre-complaint attorneys fees in only limited
circumstances (only if the EEOC administrative judge finds discrimination,
the agency disagrees, and the employee wins on appeal to the EEOC) .
Chuck, Maria, and Sally agreed that the compromise position was optimal.
In passing this back to EEOC, Sally also felt it was important to indicate
that this issue is not off the table permanently, and information provided
by the NPR initiative could inform future policy decisions in this area.
