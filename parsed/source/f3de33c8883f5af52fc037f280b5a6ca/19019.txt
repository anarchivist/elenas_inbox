TEXT:
I went to the press conference today.  The President's statement was
read.  The National Black Farmers were there, and they asked that the
President assist them as he stated he would in the meeting he had in
December. Questions were asked about what it would take to make farmers
whole, and Andrew Shepherd from the Flue-Cured Tobacco Cooperative
Stabilization Corporation answered with the following three points:   1)
compensation for quota-holders; 2) transition payments to tobacco
communities; and 3) cigarettes sold here should contain U.S. tobacco.    Rod
Kugel from the Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative indicated that he
thought that all the farmers were only a couple weeks away from uniting
behind one legislative proposal. Thanks, Mary
