        TEXT:
        Josh will run a reconciliation conference call with the agencies tomorrow
        (Wednesday) at 8:30 am.  PAD offices are responsible for letting their
        agencies know about the call and giving them the conference number
        (757-2104, code 6162) .

        There are only 30 lines open for the call (and 45 people or so calling in)
        -- so please do not make individual calls (e.g., DADs should call in with
        their PADs, other 2nd floor folks should come to Josh's office, etc.)    We
        need to reserve lines for people calling in from the agencies (otherwise
        we're just talking to ourselves).  Thanks in advance for your help.
