     TEXT:
     There are two outstanding questions we should address re: HHS' proposed
     legislative language for the adoption bonus structure.

     1) The first is outlined in an e-mail below by Matthew McKearn of OMB and
     speaks to the question of whether a state can receive per-child bonus
     payments above the number that represents an increase in its total number
     of adoptions (i.e. if a state's total number of adoptions increases from
     100-125, but the subset of special needs adoptions increases from 50-100,
     can the state claim bonuses for 50 children or can it just claim 25?). My
     recollection is that we had decided in a meeting here that the state can
     not claim bonus payments above its overall increases in adoptions. OMB,
     for obvious budget reasons, is pushing for this approach, but the
     legislation currently reads differently.

     2) The second question speaks to the issue of the use of the bonus
     payments. The legislation reads that the bonus dollars must be reinvested
     in services that support only IV-E children, rather than a broader group
     of children awaiting adoption placements.  Carol Williams left me a
     voicemail last night that said that it was the feeling of her office, the
     HHS leg affairs shop and OMB that enabling a broad use of the dollars
     somehow makes us vulnerable to questions of block-granting and a flexibile
     use of overall dollars -- a rationale I don't understand, but will explore
     further today.

     As you know, WH OMB must clear this language this week, as it is part of
     the President's Balanced Budget Plan to be submitted sometime soon, so
     we'll have to address these issues today.  Please advise.

         Subject:         Adoption Initiative Language

         You may receive a call from ACF on the structure of the adoption
         initiative bonus payments. HHS has proposed language that would determine
         bonuses in a way that differs from our understanding of how the bonuses
         would be earned. We discussed these issues with White House and DPC staff
         while reviewing the February 14 HHS report and the proposed legislative
         language, and they agree with the proposed edits.

         We have passed back changes to proposed legislative language that ACF may
         appeal to you. Our rationale for the changes are outlined below.

         The adoption assistance initiative would provide a $4,000 bonus (base bonus
         ) to States for each adoption above the baseline level and an additional
         $2,000 bonus (added bonus) for increases in special needs (IV-E eligible)
         adoptions.

         We interpreted these provisions so that the total number of added bonuses
         a State earned could equal, but not exceed the number of base bonuses in a
         year.   It is possible that the increase in the number of special needs
         adoptions in a State could exceed the increase in the total number of
         adoptions.    For example, total adoptions could increase from 1,000 to
         1,025, while the subset of IV-E adoptions increased from 600 to 650.

         The revised language limits the number of added-bonuses in a year to the
         increase in a State's total adoptions. This ensures that the $108 million
         earmarked for bonuses is sufficient to meet the goal of doubling adoptions
         by the year 2002.   Added bonuses would be paid only to the extent that
         total adoptions increased and progess was made towards the 2002 goal.
         Staff from the First Lady's Office and the DPC support this approach.
         They have an additional concern that the incentives not tilt too heavily to
          favor special needs adoptions.
