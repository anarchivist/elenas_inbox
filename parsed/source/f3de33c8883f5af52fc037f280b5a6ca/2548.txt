CONRAD Q's and A's

(Zonana, HHS)      2/12/98



Q:   In announcing your support for the Conrad Bill, you singled out the

need for "a significant price increase to reduce youth smoking" as the

"most important" factor in any bill that the President would support.              Is

this a change in emphasis?



A:   No.   In fact,    the first principle of the Five Principles President

Clinton established for national tobacco legislation last September

requires "A Comprehensive Plan to Reduce Teen Smoking,          " including "Tough

Penalties and Price Increases."         (Source:    White House fact sheet,

"President Clinton's Plan for Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation to Protect

America's Children.")




Q:    What are the other four principles?          And does the President still

support them?



A:   Absolutely.      In fact, we specifically said we like the Conrad bill

because it meets each of the Five Principles.



The President will not support piecemeal tobacco legislation.           The Five

Principles that would have to be addressed in any comprehensive


legislation

are:




 A comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking,     including penalties and

price increases.



 Full authority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products



 Changes in the way the industry does business,     including an end to

marketing to children; document disclosure; and corporate compliance

programs.



 Progress toward other public health goals,     including provisions to reduce

exposure to second-hand smoke; help to smokers who wish to enroll in

cessation programs; and provide resources for medical research.




     Protection for tobacco farmers and their communities.




Q:     Why are you supporting a bill that   Republican leaders say has no

chance of garnering any GOP support?



A:     We certainly hope Republicans will support this bill.   We're


supporting

the bill because it i s a very strong bill that meets each of the

President's Five Principles.      We view it as an important first step

toward

the enactment of comprehensive legislation and a challenge to other

members

to work toward this goal.



But, of course, the President will also support other bills that meet his

principles, whether introduced by Democrats or Republicans.       We want to

work with as many members as we can,    from both sides of the aisle,   to

adopt

comprehensive tobacco legislation.



But we will not support a bill without the significant price increase

necessary to reduc'e youth smoking.



Q:   Doesn't your embrace of a $1.50 price increase over three years,

coupled with all the new spending the President has proposed, vindicate

Republicans who say this is all about raising money and a return to Big

Government?



A:   Nonsense.   This is first and foremost about public health, and saving

America's children.



First, let me remind you that the President's proposed budget is the first

balanced budget in 30 years.     This is not about Big Government; i t ' s about

smart, disciplined government.



As for the price increase, we have said all along that price increases are


the most reliable way of achieving reductions in teen smoking.      Indeed,

it's the first of the President's Five Principles for comprehensive

legislation.



Q:   But the Five Principles called for $1.50 a pack increase over the next

decade.      Conrad calls for it in three years.



A:   The President believes that if we can get to our goal of reducing

youth

smoking more quickly, s9 much the better.      In any case, the timing is for

Congress to determine.




Q:   Isn't the emphasis on price increases at odds with the FDA's

regulation,

 which relies on restrictions on access and advertising?



A:   No.     The FDA regulation is part of the President's comprehensive plan

to reduce youth smoking.        As Secretary Shalala has said, we need to use

every tool at our disposal to reduce teen smoking, and we know that price

is one of the most effective mechanisms.       What we need is a comprehensive

approach that relies on price increase, as well as restrictions on youth

access and appeal.



Q:   If price increases are so important, why didn't the FDA regulation

raise      prices?
. ,.                                                                          Page 5 of5


A:   FDA used the tools it had in its regulatory arsenal. Now that Congress

is taking up the issue of youth smoking, it is incumbent upon the Congress

to use the most effective weapon we know of, and that weapon is price

increases.



Q:   with this emphasis on price, are you backing off from your claims that

the FDA regulation would have cut youth smoking by SO% over seven years?



A:   No.   We just need to use every tool at our disposal to cut the number

of children taking up this deadly addiction.
