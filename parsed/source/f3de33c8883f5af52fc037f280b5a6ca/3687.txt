TEXT:
1. Gene apparently wants no mention of Penn or Penn's formulation in the
planning memo.  It doesn't sound like Gene will be ready to sign off on a
joint vetting memo soon . . . . 1 think they will bring up their (NEC)
specific issues (fast track, climate change, higher ed, product liability)
in the Erskine meeting.



2.   My candidates for big DPC   upcoming intitiatives would be:

1.   Failing Schools

2.   Child Care

3.   21st Century Disease fund

4.   A crime issue: Fixing Brady, a drug rehab, or cops in inner city.


5. Obviously
Tobacco
Race proposals-- health issue, fixing bureaucracy of civil rights, more
cops in inner city,  etc

6. Good government
Support Welfare to Work
a campaign finance or entitlement reform announcment

7.   And perhaps something from:
   Liquor ads
--Domestic violence in workplace (statement with companies)
--Consumer privacy federal satement of rights
--Pell grant, Chakah Fatah
--Adoption
--Something from one of our working groups-- teenage preganancy, managed
care
