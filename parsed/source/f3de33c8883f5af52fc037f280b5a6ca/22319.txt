TEXT:
This is what speechwriting currently has for welfare section of SOU.
Bruce, I assume this is a boiled down version of what you sent but it
doesn't have anything on fathers (which you said you had included).   I
want to make sure you're comfortable with the 6.1 million -- that's
actually the decline in the welfare rolls since 1/93, though I believe the
President has talked about caseload decline in this way before. As you
know, we don't know exactly how many of those who have left the rolls have
gone to work and none of the other employment numbers we've got are
cumulative. The 200,000 who could go to work with new WTW funds is our
best estimate right now (still waiting for some verification back from DOL
by end of day).  Josh needs to get this back to Waldman in next 30 minutes
or so in order for a draft to go in by 5 p.m.

In the last six years, we have moved [6.1 million] people from welfare to
work.   Two years ago, from this podium, I asked five companies to lead a
national effort to hire people off the welfare rolls.   As of tonight, our
Welfare to Work Partnership includes 10,000 companies. And my budget
provides funds to create jobs to move another 200,000 people from welfare
to work'.
