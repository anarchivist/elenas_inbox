Attached please find a 3-page dump of what is in the school safety report
and how (more or less) it ties to our announcements.    It needs to be
cleaned up and -- of course -- are policy announcements aren't 100% nailed
down ... so consider this in draft from.  Please let me know your
reactions.    There's a lot of other paper being prepared that we mayor may
not use, but this pretty much distills what we're working with.    I'm sure
the agencies will hate it ... jc3

·   The White House Conference on School Safety. Although schools are generalIy safer
    today than they were' just a few years ago -- and statistics show that students are safer
    sitting in a classroom than walking down a street -- there is still much more that we can
    do to improve school safety and security. In particular, the multiple shootings that took
    place in schools in Pearl, MS, Paducah, KY, Jonesboro, AK, and Springfield, OR, serve
    as painful reminders that no community is immune from senseless violence -- and that alI
    communities must do their best to prevent such tragedies from ever occurring. The
    White House Conference on School Safety provides an opportunity for Americans to
    learn more about how they can make their own schools and communities safer.

·   Unveiling the First Annual Report on School Crime and Safety. The first step in
    addressing school safety is for alI of us to better understand the nature and magnitude of
    the problem. At the conference, the President wilI unveil the first Annual Report on
    School Crime and Safety -- a report intended to give parents, principals and policy
    makers an accurate, yearly snapshot of the school crime, as welI as to provide information
    on what practical steps they can take to make their schools safer.

    Major Findings of the Report:

           Students less likely to be victimized but more likely to feel unsafe. Although
           the number of multiple homicides at schools has increased since 1993 (from 2 to 6
           -- and with 4 times as many victims), the overall crime rate has actually dropped
           (from 164 crimes per 1,000 students in 1993 to about 128 such crimes in 1996).
           However, the percentage of students reporting that they felt unsafe at or on their
           way to school has increased.

           Most schools are safer than community at large. While the overalI level of
           school and non-school crime is about the same (about 3 million crimes in each
           setting), students are more than twice as likely to experience serious violent crime
           while out of school. And the very worst violent victimizations -- murders and
           suicides -- rarely occur in or near schools. Fewer than 1% of the 7,357 thousand
           children who were murdered in 1992-93 -- or 63 -- were killed at school.

           Serious crime and violence concentrated in a small percentage of schools.
           Only about 10% of public schools report serious or violent crimes to their local
           police departments. Nearly half -- or 47% -- of schools report less serious or
           non-violent crimes to police, and 43% report absolutely no crimes at all.

           Violence more likely in larger, urban schools and with older students. One
           third oflarge schools (1,000+ students) report serious violent crimes to police,
           compared with less than .1 % for smalI schools. Also urban schools are twice as
           likely than rural schools to report serious violent crimes, and middle and high
           schools are 4 times more likely than elementary schools to report such crimes.

                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
           physical attacks and fights without weapons are the crimes most often reported to
           police by middle and high schools. Vandalism is the most common crime
           reported by elementary schools. In total, during the 1997 school year, there were
           nearly 20 times more of these crimes reported by schools than more serious
           violent crimes -- such as rape, robbery and attacks with weapons.

    Other Important Findings:

           Fewer weapons in schools. About 6% of high school seniors -- less than in
           recent years -- are carrying firearms and other weapons to schools. Also, the
           percentage of seniors intentionally injured -- with or without weapons -- has not
           changed significantly over the past 20 years.

           Gang presence has nearly doubled. Between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of
           students reporting the presence of street gangs in their schools increased from
           15% to 28% -- including large increases at urban, suburban and rural schools.

           Violence and drugs linked. Students who reported being the victims of violent
           crimes were more likely to report the availability of drugs at school. The same is
           true for students involved with gangs and guns.

           Teachers often crime victims. Nearly 30% of teachers experience theft, and
           another 10-15% are the victims of violent crimes.

·   The President's Call to Action. During a panel discussion with a group of recognized
    school safety advocates and youth violence experts, the President will announce a series
    of new initiatives that address many of the problems identified in the Annual Report on
    School Crime and Safety. Specifically, he will propose:

           (1) A New Federal Response for Violent Deaths in Schools. Over the past
           year we have learned that few, if any, communities are truly prepared to respond
           to multiple school shootings like the ones that took place in Pearl, MS, Paducah,
           KY, Jonesboro, AK, and Springfield, OR. In addition to the devastating impact
           on victims and their families, these tragic events forced the affected communities
           to divert scarce resources to urgent but unplanned activities (i.e., increased
           security, ongoing counseling and more). Accepting a recommendation put forth
           by the communities impacted by the recent school shootings, the President will
           announce his support for the establishment of a $12 million Emergency Response
           Fund and of a multi-agency School Emergency Response to Violence Team
           (Team SERV). Team SERV's mission will be to ensure an improved,
           coordinated federal response to school-associated violent deaths.

           (2) Targeted Resources for Schools with Serious Crime Problems. For the
           estimated 10% of schools with serious crime problems, we must deploy tough,


                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                    HtlX·Dump Conversion
gangs, guns and drugs in and near schools; using metal detectors to keep weapons
out of schools; partnering and sharing information with local law enforcement and
juvenile justice authorities; and working with local community police to better
address school-related crime problems. To help launch such efforts locally, the
President will announce a new $65 million initiative for schools and communities
with serious crime and violence problems to hire and train as many as 2,000
community police and school resource officers. [Building on his efforts to crack
down on gun traffickers, the President also directed the Secretary of the Treasury,
Attorney General, and Secretary of Education to develop a plan to ensure that all
firearms recovered on or near school premises are traced to their original point of
purchase.]

(3) Reforms to Help Make All Schools Safe, Disciplined and Drug-Free. As
the Annual Report on School Crime and Safety shows, the problems facing most
schools include lesser crimes and lack of discipline. To help these schools
develop the comprehensive, school-wide plans they need to prevent serious crime,
violence and drug use from taking hold, the President will call for significant
reforms to the federal government's Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. He
wiII propose that federally funded school safety and anti-drug programs include:
tough, but fair, discipline policies; plans for secure schools and safe pathways;
intervention for troubled youth; annual school report cards; effective prevention,
after school programs and anti-drug policies; parental involvement; and crisis
management plans.

(4). Community-Wide Response to School Safety and Violence. While we
may never understand what drove a handful of children to tum and open fire on
their classmates, teachers and families, we can -- and should -- commit ourselves
to do everything possible to prevent such violent tragedies from every taking .
place. To help promote a coordinated, community-wide response to school safety
throughout the country, the President will announce a new interagency initiative
designed to help communities develop comprehensive, community-wide school
safety strategies by submitting one application for a series of youth violence grant
programs. This new "Safe Learning Environments" initiative will provide at
least $25 million to help 10 communities put such comprehensive strategies into
place. The President will also kick-off an MTV-sponsored, year-long media
campaign on school safety and youth violence.
