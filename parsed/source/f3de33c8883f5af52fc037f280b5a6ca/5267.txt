TEXT:
We need to sit down next week and firm up our proposals for the FY99
budget and SOTU, so we can be ready for the budget back-and-forth after
Thanksgiving.  Perhaps we can devote Monday's meeting to that -- so don't
even think about scheduling those 10 o'clock conference calls, flu shots,
coffee runs, etc.  (In Cynthia's honor, we'll set half an hour aside to
listen to her press briefing on the new welfare regulation, live from
Wichita. )

We seem to have a good fix on the range of budgetary options for health
care and child care.  I hope we can do the same on education, crime,
housing/welfare, and the various race ideas.  Anything we want $ for has
to be ready soon.
