 The meeting to continue discussions surrounding a possible White House
 Conference on Public Schools will take place tomorrow, 10/22, at 4:00pm in
 Mickey Ibarra's office.


[Please note that until we decide whether to move forward with this conference,
this will be a small IGA/NEC/DPC discussion.]   please let me know if you will
not be able to attend.  Thanks.

I think we need some more discussion to address the questions Sylvia posses
below. Based on further conversations I've had with the USCM and the experience
of the Detroit Summit last week, I would like to meet this week to see if we
can reach agreement so a larger meeting can be convened by Sylvia to move
forward. Please let me know if you have some other suggestions for addressing
these issues you'd like to express before the meeting. I will ask Suzanne Dale
to schedule. Thanks.

The only question I have about having a meeting now is has enough work been
done to try to answer some of the fundamental questions:

Who should attend?
What would be the theme? Responsibility in schools?
What is the objective of the conference?

IF you think we are far enough along on these questions, please let me know and
I will call a meeting.

I met with Mayor    Paul Helmke (R-Ft. Wayne, IN). president of the US Conf. of


    Mayors, DeeDee Corradini (D-Salt Lake City), vice president of USCM, and Tom
    Cochran, executive director, USCM yesterday to discuss a number of issues of
    cncern to them and the White House. Regarding a possible WH Conference on
    Public Schools, I indicated that we are actively considering their proposal and
    it seemed clear to me that any such conference would need the involvement of a
    number of major stakeholders in education (more than mayors). They mentioned
    superintendents, school boards, and teacher organizations as perhaps logical
    but caution against too many. They also do not want to get lost in the crowd.

    Sylvia, I think we need you to play the "honest broker" role in the next
    discussion of a WH Conference on Public Schools. I suggest we insist on
    attendance from Bruce or Elena, Gene, Ann, Leg.Affairs,Maria, Mike Cohen, and
    me to get the issues on the table. I sense from our last discussion of this
    issue at our message meeting yesterday,   there is angst relative to the role
    of Mayors and the ownership DPC and NEC feel about the issue of education in
    general.

     I think you are the best bet for bringing closure to a decision ---yes or no
    for a conference. And if yes, I'm very confident everyone's concerns can be
    addressed by a planning group led by DPC. I strongly believe the conference
    should occur, preferably in April after all the Washinton winter meetings of
    the intergovernmental groups are concluded and that the USCM should play a
    prominent role. However, I   think it would be difficult for IGA to play the
    lead role. If you think differently, I'd like a chance to discuss this with
    you.- Thanks for all your support.
