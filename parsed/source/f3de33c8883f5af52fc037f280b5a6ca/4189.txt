      Subject:         POTUS Meeting - ADA Enforcement

      Thanks for listening to my plea this morning. It would make a great
      impact if the President could state at this Wednesday's disability meeting
      that we will call for a 19% (which is only $2 million) increase in funding
      for ADA Enforcement in our FY99 DOJ Budget request.  Please see the
      attached proposed talking points. Thanks.

      ADA ENFORCEMENT

      o       Vigorous enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
      has been a top priority of my Administration. The Justice Department, the
      EEOC and other federal agencies have established aggressive enforcement
      programs. We have emphasized voluntary compliance, but have not been
      afraid to litigate when entities fail to comply with the law.

      o       Although we have been quite successful, we all know we have a
      long way to go. All of you are all too familiar with the backlogs at the
      Justice Department and the EEOC. We all know that our resources are not
      sufficient to address the majority of meritorious complaints
      received.

      o       My budgets have consistently called for an increase for ADA
      enforcement at the Department of Justice. However, the Congress has failed
      to approve these increases.

                                FY 1998: 5%  ($477,000)
                                        FY 1997: 3.9% ($361,000)

      (MICHAEL, THE NEXT TALKING POINT IS THE ONE WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
      STRONGER. )

      o          We are considering a proposal to significantly increase ADA


     enforcement resources in the FY 1999 budget I will submit to Congress
     early next year. (DOJ*s OMB request calls for a 19% increase ($2,173,000).

     o       Members of both houses of Congress have said they will never
     weaken the ADA.  (As Senator Hutchinson (R-AR) recently told a reporter
     *[P]oliticians see it as political nitroglycerin ... They*re afraid to
     handle it, afraid to touch it.*)

     o       By failing to adopt my proposals for very limited increases to
     already limited enforcement budgets, they have indirectly weakened the law.

     o       The ADA became law because your organizations, both nationally
     and at the grassroots level, worked together to educate the Congress on
     why the law was urgently needed. You won because you were well-organized
     and persistent.   Obtaining increases for ADA enforcement will require a
     similar effort.
