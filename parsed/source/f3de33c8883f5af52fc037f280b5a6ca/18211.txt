CAPITOL JOURNAL
Conservatives Desert Connerly Over Gay Rights

By GEORGE SKELTON
     SACRAMENTO--It has been four weeks since Ward Connerly won big on a
new
playing field and the boos have not stopped.

The hoots are coming from many of the same conservatives who earlier
cheered his drive to end racial preferences in public hiring, contracting
and
university admissions--what commonly is called affirmative action.

The mood of those same admirers turned ugly when Connerly took up the
cause of gay rights, pushing the UC regents into providing health benefits
for
same-sex partners of university employees.

To win, Connerly had to roll his old friend and political ally, Gov. Pete
Wilson, who argued that treating gay couples the same as married
heterosexuals
will "spotlight the University of California as a role model for
undermining
marriage and destabilizing famiiies."


Connerly countered that he certainly respects marriage, having been
happily married himself for 35 years, "but there are values that transcend
marriage: the values of equality.      individual liberty.    . letting
people
pursue happiness on their own terms."

Since then, Wilson reportedly has been grumpy toward his onetime protege
and some of the governor's aides have snubbed him. "I don't give a damn,"
Connerly told me.

Still, he acknowledged, "This was the toughest decision that I've had to
make as a regent. Despite all the crap that I've endured on the race
issue, it
doesn't begin to compare to this issue. The gut reaction people have is
strong, and you can't reason with them."

In the same way that Connerly being black afforded him special
credibility on the race issue, his being a Republican conservative made him
especially worth listening to on gay rights. It was one of those "Nixon
goes
to China" moves. But he has paid a steep price.

Many blacks accused Connerly of being an "Uncle Tom." Now, many
conservatives are accusing him of being disloyal to the governor and--to
sum
it up gently--siding with depravity and the devil.

On Connerly's old wooden desk in his Sacramento land consulting
office--occupying a downtown Victorian--there is a stack of negative
letters.
Some simply are hate mail.

One Connerly reply in particular is the type of thing most of us
occasionally are tempted to write, but never quite muster the nerve:

"Initially, I was inclined to treat your letter as just another
communication from an ignorant, bigoted, intolerant individual and ignore
it.
However, I finally concluded that while you may fit some of that
description,
it would be wrong of me to characterize you as ignorant. You are an
'attorney
at law.' This suggests some exposure to legal matters and the education
process."

Connerly's blunt response continued, in part:

"It always astounds me that those with bigoted tendencies such as yours
invoke the Scriptures to support their bigotry. I am part of an interracial
marriage. When my wife and I" married, there were those who said that such
unions were immoral, unnatural, contrary to the Bible and would lead to the
deterioration of civilization. In short, the ignorance and nonsense about
the
societal effects of interracial marriage 35 years ago is just as absurd
today
with reference to sexual orientation.

"Many years ago, I was forced to confront my prejudices because of a gay
employee who was 'normal' by every societal standard except for his sexual


orientation. Choosing to be gay was no more of a choice for [him] than
choosing to be male or cocoa brown was for me. Didn't the same God who
made me
make my former gay employee? As a Christian, who am I to say, then, that
God
goofed?"

Another Connerly response: "To suggest that I have been disloyal [to
Wilson] is an insult. Over the past eight years I have supported the
governor
as much as anyone. I have contributed a handsome amount to his
[campaigns] . "

But now, Connerly told me, some conservative donors to his fledging
American Civil Rights Institute "are going ape."

"I knew it going in," he said, "I had no choice. I couldn't have looked
that staff member in the eye. Couldn't look myself in the eye. I'll just
ride
it out."

Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco), a lesbian, got Connerly up
to speed on gay issues before the UC regents' vote. "He's dogged, he's
ceaseless, he's articulate," she said.

"I'm not really sure why he took up this cause, frankly, and I'm not
concerned. I'm appreciative and grateful."

Migden called my attention to all this because she had a point: "Don't
write anybody off. In politics, there are always twists and turns and
different chapters and episodes."

And opportunities for rare alliances and accomplishments--especially by
committed people whose game isn't always playing to the cheers of the
political crowd.
