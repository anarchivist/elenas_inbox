TEXT:
On Jan. 29 I met with the California School Boards Association leadership,
and discussed Unz with them. Very simple summary:

1. They oppose Unz--they view it as bad education/bilingual ed policy;
bad governance, because it erodes local control and because statewide
initiatives are a bad way to make education policy;

2.   They have absolutely no doubt that it will pass.

3. They say that an attempt to find a legislative compromise has fallen
apart; Karen, are you getting the same story from your sources?

4. They don't have a strong view as to whether the Administration should
take a position, and did not appear to have give much thought to that.
They would love our support, recognize the possibility of mobilizing
opposition if we do, and don't think we would effect the outcome.  They
asked if there were some way we could keep Diane Feinstein from supporting
the initiative.

5.  They expect the Hispanic Delegation from California to take strong
stances against the initiative (even though they think some, such as
Loretta Sanchez, will be seriously hurt by taking this position).   They
expect the rest of the delegation to support .the proposition or stay out
of the battle.

Maria--where do things stand on the trip to CA. you were planning?
