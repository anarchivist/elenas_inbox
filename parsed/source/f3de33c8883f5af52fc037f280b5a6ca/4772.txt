TEXT:
Dawn Chirwa is sending us a document that the Department of Education
wants to release at ACE's conference on diversity in higher education
tomorrow; the document has been cleared by the civil rights division, and
is currently being ok'd by OLC.   My understanding is that the document is
something along the lines of guidelines for higher ed institutions to use
in assessing their practices in admissions, financial aid, etc.   As soon
as we get a copy from the counsel's office we will forward a copy to you.

Thanks.
