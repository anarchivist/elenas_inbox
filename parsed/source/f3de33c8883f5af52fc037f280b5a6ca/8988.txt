Q:   Do you stand behind the "horror stories" that you have highlighted in recent
     months?

A:   We certainly have no reason to doubt the extremely troubling story that David Garvey has
     told. It is important to note that these cases are almost always in dispute. Not
     surprisingly, even when the evidence is overwhelming to the contrary, we have yet to
     come across any HMO or health plan that has acknowledged their responsibility for any
     wrongful actions.

     It is also important to note that we never cite a case that has not been validated by a
     credible, independent source.

Q:   Administration officials have said they are not confident with Ricka Powers' story?

A:   First, this case was also referred to us by credible independent sources. * Subsequent to
     the event, however, we received additional information, and it was impossible for us to
     completely validate some ofthe concerns that were raised. Because we could not fully
     validate some of the specific concerns raised, we have chosen not to repeat this story.
     However, that should not suggest to anyone that we are questioning Ricka Powers'
     credibility or the horrible situation that she faces.

     Background on Garvey Case:

     Claim: The Washington Post claims that Barbara Garvey had to be moved because the hospital
     she was at did not perform bone marrow transplants.

     Response: Dr. Kaye Kawahara, the attending physician in Hawaii, said in her deposition in the
     Garvey case that she had recommended that a bone marrow transplant for Barbara Garvey be
     done in Hawaii. She testified that Queens Medical Center (where Mrs. Garvey was in an
     isolation room) does have a transplant center, and it typically shares the responsibility for
     transplants with St. Francis (a nearby hospital in Hawaii). She also said that Mrs. Garvey's
     transplant could be performed at St. Francis in conjunction with the Queens Medical Center.
     When told that the HMO would not pay for the transplant on cite, Dr. Kawahara tried again to
     prevent Mrs. Garvey from traveling all the way back to Chicago, by suggesting that the transplant
     be done in Seattle because "the closer the unit was, the better for the patient." She also testified
     that the HMO doctor (Dr. Ghalie) said he expected the HMO would not approve a transplant
     anywhere in the country but Rush Hospital in Chicago.

     Claim: The Washington Post claims that Garvey's doctor said she ignored advise that to come in
     for blood tests, instead traveling to Hawaii.

     Response: Barbara Garvey was routinely treated for arthritis. She visited with a nurse for
     routine tests on May 23 and advised the nurse that she would be on vacation. She went on
     vacation on May 28. Tests came back on or about June 1st that indicated serious problems in
     low white blood cell count. According to Mr. Garvey, Mrs. Garvey received a voice mail asking
     her to come in for more tests. There was no mention of any results from any past tests, and there
     was no indication that this was an emergency rather than a request for standard tests.
     Regardless, the main dispute is around the cause of death. Once Mrs. Garvey was receiving
     critical care in Hawaii, she should not have been forced to take the return flight to Chicago,
     which she was not in condition to withstand, in order to receive needed care.
