DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL LETTER TO THE ED-FLEX CONFEREES

Dear

I am deeply concerned by the action taken by the Senate in its version of
the Ed-Flex bill, S.280, that threatens the commitment the Congress and I
made to helping the nationO,s schools hire 100,000 new, qualified teachers
to help school districts reduce class size in the early grades.   These
teachers would help every State educate the rising tide of new enrollments
in smaller classes and thus with a greater impact on educational
achievement. Research shows the value of lowering class size.   Students
attending small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational
progress than students in larger classes, with sustained achievement gains
and greatest benefits for lower-achieving, minority and poor children.

The SenateO,s action would permit Local Education Agencies to shift the
$1.2 billion appropriated for Class Size Reduction and new.teacher hiring
to special education.   Both class size education and special education
programs make unique contributions to helping students achieve high
standards and deserve our strong support.

The extension of the Ed-Flex authority permits States to waive certain
Federal laws when doing so can help them raise educational achievement
a concept that has strong bipartisan support. The Conference should not
imperil that support with an amendment that undermines our previous
commitment on reducing class size.

If the Congress sends me a bill with the Senate provision on Class Size
funding included, I will veto it.
