TEXT:
Last night ABC News did a "closer look" segment on programs to reduce teen
smoking.

The first part outlined the facts about teen smoking (attributing them
correctly to CDC) -- that 6000 youth start smoking every day (remember the
3000 is technically how many become "regular" smokers each day), and that
smoking among teens is up 73% since 1988 (these are all numbers released
last year although ABCdidn't make that clear) .

The second part outlined a new study released by the state of Florida
yesterday about the effectiveness of the state's counteradvertising
campaign -- the study apparently shows 10% fewer teens are smoking. We
are getting our hands on this study and will do a weekly if it looks
interesting. The segment criticized the Phillip Morris sponsored
anti-youth smoking ads, showing focus group interviews with kids saying
they were goofy and with the head of Mass tobacco control program.   The PM
spokeswoman said their research found them to be effective but when press
if they'd asked kids if they were less likely to smoke as a result she
said no.  The conclusion was "a growing body of evidence shows the right
kind of tv ads can reduce youth smoking -- crucial info for the states now
deciding how to use their tobacco settlement funds."

The third part described Florida's tobacco court and rules imposing $25
fines on kids caught smoking, interviewing kids who said as a result of
being caught they wouldn't smoke again but noting there isn't rigorous
research on whether these programs work and noting advocates' criticism
that retailers, not kids, should be punished.

There was no mention of us or the fights in Washington over the lawsuit
funds.
