NEW POLL SHOWS LATEST RIGHT WING ATTACKS AGAINST GAY AMERICANS HAVE SEVERE
POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS FOR GOP

America Rejects the Hefley Amendment By A Wide Margin, According To Poll

 WASHINGTON -- A new poll released today by HRC and conducted by the
polling firm Penn, Schoen, and Berland shows that dire political
consequences await the GOP if they continue down their current path of
anti-gay rhetoric and discriminatory legislation against gay Americans,
according to the Human Rights Campaign.
         "The vast majority of Americans are appalled by the recent anti-gay
crusade waged by the Right-wing.   This poll shows that politicians who once
thought they benefitted from attacking gays may be in for a rude awakening
in November. America has drawn a line in the sand that says that job
discrimination and singling out one group of Americans is morally and
politically unacceptable," said HRC communications director and senior
strategist David M. Smith.
        The poll results show that Americans overwhelmingly oppose the
Hefley amendment, which would reverse President Clinton's executive order
banning discrimination against gay men and women in federal employment.   64
percent of Americans said they are against Congress overturning the
executive order, compared to only 28 percent who support overturning the
discrimination ban.  The Hefley amendment is expected to be introduced this
week to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill.
        "Members of Congress who vote for the Hefley amendment are clearly
out of touch with the .American people.  Those who choose to support this
amendment are branding themselves with a big scarlet letter that screams,
   '.

'I am intolerant.'   Our poll shows that there are grave consequences for
members of Congress who align themselves with religious political
extremists," said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.
         Among the findings in today's poll is that 75 percent of Americans
believe job discrimination against gay people should be illegal. The poll
also shows that there are political consequences for gay bashing with 48
percent of likely voters saying that they would be "less likely" to vote
for a Congressperson who voted to overturn President Clinton's ban barring
job discrimination against gays. Only 17 percent of respondents said
overturning the discrimination ban would make them "more likely" to vote
for their Congressperson.
        The poll also asked how the recent attacks on gay Americans by the
GOP affected the respondents opinion of the Republican party.   40 percent
said their opinion was "less favorable." Only 18 percent said anti-gay
rhetoric made their impression of the party "more favorable."
        According to the poll, Americans overwhelming believe the recent
anti-gay rhetoric, such as senate Majority leader Trent'Lott's comparison
of gay people to kleptomaniacs is divisive.   62 percent said they believe
that the recent public "discussion" on the equality of gay Americans hurts
the country and fosters a climate of intolerance and hostility, while just
24 percent of say it helps the country.
        "Voters are perplexed by this new obsession with gay people and are
wondering when Congress will realize it is time to start focusing on real
issues instead of red-meat for the Far Right" Smith.
          In an effort to appease Focus On The Family's James Dobson and his
political deputy Gary Bauer, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott kicked off
a wave of anti-gay rhetoric when he recently said that homosexuality was a
sin and likened gays to alcoholics and kleptomaniacs. His comments were
followed by disparaging remarks about gay people by several public
officials including Senator Don Nickles (R-Okla.), Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX.)
and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)   These attacks intensified after fifteen
religious political organizations embarked on a divisive ad campaign
targeting gay Americans and their family members. This orchestrated
campaign of discrimination has now spread to the House where a plethora of
anti-gay legislation has been introduced.   Last night, the House narrowly
passed two amendments to the VA/HUD appropriations bill that have grave
implications for gay Americans. The Hilleary amendment, which passed by a
vote of 231-230, would drastically cut housing funds for people with AIDS.
The Riggs amendment, which passed by a vote of 214-212, would prohibit San
Francisco from using VA-HUD funds to implement its city ordinance against
discrimination in city contracts.
        The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at
home, at work, and in the community.
