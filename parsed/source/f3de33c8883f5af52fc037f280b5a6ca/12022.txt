     MEMORANDUM TO ELENA KAGAN:

     From:          Irene Bueno

     Subject:       IMMIGRATION LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS - Wednesday, March 31 at:
                    TBA

     Introduction

     On Wednesday, 3/31 you are scheduled to chair a meeting to discuss legislative options on
     various immigration issues including:

     1. Criminal detention! relief from detention
     2. Late Amnesty
     3. 245(i)

     You will also discuss whether the Administration should introduce a legislative package.
     While we should get input for Leg Affairs, I would recommend that we introduce a legislation
     package called the, "Immigration Fairness Act of 1999" and include the provisions listed below
      plus the NACARAIparity legislation. We could add the battered immigrant and trafficking
     provisions that are in our crime bill. Of course, the legislative proposals will be moved
     separately.

     Legislative Proposals

     Criminal DetentionlRelief from detention


     DOJlINS is working on budgetary, administrative and legislative proposals to address the
     overcrowding of the INS detention centers. Reprogramming of $31 million has been approved
     and $80 million is the supplemental bill. DOJIINS is developing plans under their
     administrative authority to address this problem.

     On the policy side, DOJIINS is developing a policy to address a related issue that would ease
     overcrowding to restore immigration judges discretion to provide relief from detention. Under
     current law, if an immigrant is convicted of an felony, they are subject to mandatory detention
     and immigration judges have no discretion. There are a number of very tragic cases of
     immigrants who 20 years ago was convicted of robbery but has since become responsible
     individuals - has a job, family etc. and is being detained. You may recall that the Supreme Court
     let stand lower-court rulings on whether immigrant are permitted to appeal mandatory detention
     orders to ajudge. In follow up, a 3/13/99 Washington Post editorial criticized the
     Administration for interpreting the law in the harshest manner by making the law retroactive and
     suggested that the Administration should stop blocking immigrants from exercising their rights
                                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

     and urged the Administration to submit and fight for legislation to restore "some balance and
     proportion" to its laws.

     The options that have been suggested by advocacy groups are the following:

     1. do not apply the law retroactively - I'm not sure if this is legislation or a change to our
     regulations.
     2. restore immigration judges discretion to provide relief from detention.
     3. propose changes to the crimes that are considered under mandatory detention.

     I have not discussed these options with DOJ/INS since they were working on their proposals but
     if they do not raise this options, I recommend that you ask them to consider these proposals. I
     think that we should consider the options seriously.

     Late Amnesty/Section 377

     DOJ has been at the question of whether the group that is considered "front-desked" can be
     expanded beyond the current group defined by the DOJ. DOJ is responding to a letter from the
     Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) addressing this issue. After DOJ checks one more thing
     (per John Morton), they expect to send a letter to them indicating that they cannot front desk this
     group and therefore a legislative fix would be necessary.

     The legislative option is whether to propose or support a legislative fix to the registry date (to,
     perhaps, January 1984) that would relieve all bona fide members of the late amnesty class (all of
     whom had to be in the U.S. prior to January 1, 1982).     I think we should support this fix.

     Section 24S(i)

     Under 245(i) allowed undocumented immigrants in the US to adjust their status under section
     245 once they, because of family relationships or job skills, became eligible for LPR, provided
     they pay a surcharge. 245 (i) was scheduled to expire on 9/30/97, however in a compromise, the
     Commerce Appropriations bill of 1998 terminated 245(i) but grand fathered certain immigrants.

     The legislative proposal would be to reinstate 245(i).

     The Administration proposed to reinstate in the Omnibus bill but it failed I believe due to Rep.
     Smith's opposition but I think there is some bipartisan support for the reinstatement of245(i).
     For example, Hatch includes reinstatement for battered immigrants in his VAWA and Crime bill.
      I think we should support this proposal.
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




Immigration Issues -- as of March 26, 1999

HOT ISSUES

1.   Public Charge

     Status:Pelldillg AG approval of the NPRM alldfield guidallce. DOJIINS expected to
                    selld NPRM alld guidallce to OMB by week ofApril 5th. Major policy
                    issues have beell resolved but the NPRM alld field guidallce have not yet
                    beell reviewed. There is great urgellCY to published this NPRM and we
                    should COli sider all alllloullcemellt ill CA.

                   Barbara Strack (INS) -- 514-3242 or 514-8860

2.   NACARA Regulations

     Status: OLD is filldillg a rebuttal presumptioll of extreme hardship for Salvadoralls
                   alld Guatemalalls covered by the legislatioll (filed as of 1 2/31/91, aka
                   ABC class). DOJ is draftillg the filial regulation Oil the presumptioll
                   alld other issues. The timillg is ullclear but there is great urgency to
                   resolve this ASAP.

                   John Morton (DOJ) -- 514-9343

3.   Parity for Salvadorans and Guatemalans & others?

     Backgroulld: We had beell explorillg legislatioll that would provide parity for
                  Salvadoralls alld Guatemalalls equal to what the Nicaraguans &
                  Cubans got ill NACARA. Ullder NACARA, Nicaragualls & Cuballs
                  who were ill the coulltry as of 12/1/95 were able to adjust their status
                  whereas Salvadoralls, Guatemalalls, were ollly permitted to seek
                  hardship relieffrom deportation if they filed all asylum application
                  before 12/31/91, were members of the ABC class alld met other
                  requiremellts. (Similar relief was provided to Eastem Europealls
                  who filed asylum applicatiolls prior to 1992).


                                             1
                                                               .      Hex·Dump Conversion



                 Prior to the Central America (CA.) trip and before we know where DOJ
                 would come out on extreme presumption, we decided to postpone further
                 discussions about legislative strategy until we knew more about the
                 presumption and recommended a strategy that the President would
                 express general support of legislation that provides parity.

                 Now we understand that DOJ is moving toward a rebuttal presumption.
                 Since under a rebuttal presumption some Salvadorans & Guatemalans
                 may not meet the hardship requirement and given the President's very
                 strong statements in CA. in support of legislation and that some in
                 Congress interpreted the Presidents' statements that he will submit his
                 own parity proposal, we have resumed our consideration of options we
                 had considered last month that were drafted by Scott Busby, NSC (see
                 attached).

                 DOJIINS is reviewing these options and on Monday, 3/29, will submit
                 these proposals to DPC in preparation for a Tuesday meeting. NSC
                 (Eric Schwartz) has also requested this same information. I told INS
                 and Justice to send DPC and NSC the same information on the
                 legislative proposals. Scott Busby, NSC has been on leave but I will
                 send him an e-mail to give him an update on this process.

                 Leg. Affairs has been consulting with the Hill re: what this bill would
                 look like. There appears to be bi-partisan interest in some kind of
                 legislative package, though many members are pushing for us to do the
                 presumption of extreme hardship first. The Congressional Hispanic
                 Caucus (CHC) is expecting the President to submit a proposal. Rep.
                 Guttierrez has introduced a bill that would provides complete parity for
                 Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, Haitians, who were in this
                 country as of 1995. Eastern Europeans who had filed for asylum by
                 12/31 would be granted parity as well.

4.   Battered Immigrants

     Status:          The VA WA Act of 1994 and other immigration laws provided certain.
                            protections and benefits to battered immigrants. However, as
                            result of laws passed subsequently, these protections and benefits
                            were reduced or eliminated for many immigrants including
                            battered immigrants. We have worked out with DOJ that we will
                            include some battered provisions in the President's Crime bill.

                     issue that would ease overcrowding to restore immigration judges
                     discretion to determine whether an immigrant should be put in
                     detention. There are a number of very tragic cases ofimmigrants who
                     20 years ago was convicted of robbery but has since become responsible
                     individuals - has a job, family etc. and is being detained and deported.


6.   Late Amnesty/Section 377

     Status:OLC is looking at the question ofwhether the group that is considered
                   ''front-desked'' can be expanded beyond the current group defined by
                  the DOJ. OLC is responding to a letter from the Congressional
                  Hispanic Caucus (CHC) addressing this issue. After they check one
                   more thing (per John Morton), they expect to send a letter to them
                  indicating that they cannot front desk this group and therefore a
                  legislative fIX would be necessary. (CHC ask that we send this letter so
                  they can move on legislative to fIX the registry date to perhaps January
                  1984,
                   We are also pursuing whether to propose or support a legislative fIX to
                  the registry date (to, perhaps, January 1984) that would relieve all bona

7.   HIV+ Refugees

     Status: We need to determine where the INS is in developing their comprehensive
                   regulation. INS is reviewing it's current standard that prevented many
                   HIV+refugees from entering the country and may propose changes that
                   would make it easier for HIV+ refugees to enter the country. Scott is

                   victims of exploitation (including trafficking and smuggling).
                   Currently, this legislation is part of the Administration's crime bill. In
                   addition, I am beginning a process to consider develop more
                   comprehensive policies/legislation on the issue this issue. This issue
                   has also been identified as a priority by the White House Civil Rights
                   Coordinating Council and I am leading the subgroup on of Council.

      Status: The Department ofLabor had been approached by Senator Coverdell to begin
                    again a bi-partisan process on H2A reform. We have been approached
                    by grower lobbyists re: heading a process to do the same (though not
                    necessarily a bi-partisan process). Commissioner Meissner has met

                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
                      with Coverdell. Legislative Affairs is checking with Sen. Bob Graham
                      to determine ifwe need to convene the bipartisan process on H2A (he
                      had mentioned something to Maria).

13.    HIB

       Status: The Department ofLabor published proposed regulation in follow up to
                     legislation passed last year that raises the cap on the number of HI B
                     visas and makes other changes. Senators Bob Graham and Abraham
                     and companies have sent letters to DOL opposing some of the provisions
                     of the regulation - overly burdensome, not intended under the
                     legislation, etc. OMB is reviewing those comments and will push DOL
                     on some of them. Also, the cap is being reached and there is some
                     concerns. Senator Abraham staff believes there may be a way to raise
                     the cap without passing legislation but by changing the way we count
                     the numbers of visas. OMB staffis exploring this proposal.

Section 245(i)

Under 245(i) allowed undocumented immigrants in the US to adjust their status under section
245 once they, because of family relationships or job skills, became eligible for LPR, provided
they pay a surchage. 245 (i) was scheduled to expire on 9/30/97, however in a compromise, the
Commerce Appropriations bill of 1998 terminated 245(i) but grand fathered certain immigrants.
The legislative proposal would be to reinstate 245(i). The Administration proposed to reinstate
in the Omnibus bill but it failed I believe due to Rep. ,Smith's opposition but I think there is
some bipartisan support for the reinstatement of245(i). For example, Hatch includes
reinstatement for battered immigrants in his V A WA and Crime bill.

NEW ISSUES

14. Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA)

       Status:        This legislation that was passed as part of the FY1999 Omnibus bill
                             enables Haitians who filed asylum claims or who were paroled
                             into the US before 12/31/95 to adjust to LPR. Haitians were left

     15. Treatment New Arrivals from Central Americans

           Status: On March 26, 1999, NCLR sent a letter to the AG expressing profound concern
                        with the Administration's policy response to new arrivals from Central
                        America in 3 areas: (1) INS intention to house many Central Americans
                        arrivals in local jails and criminal facilities some that are far away from
                        the border; (2) government does not plan to provide any assistance to
                        those arrivals that choose to depart the US voluntarily and is seeking to
                        maximize detentions times; (3) U.S. Attorney's office is criminally
                        prosecuting large numbers of Central American arrivals for unlawful
                        entry.     These points were raised during my meeting with Central
                        Americans.

                         The letter is under review but there may be some administrative or
                         legislative proposals that are developed to respond to the concerns.

     16.   Las Vegas Situation

           Status:       Immigrants were fraudently received work authorization and subject to
                         deportation. This group is primarily in the Las Vegas area and have
                         raised this issue with the VP and asked for TPS. However, according to
                         INS there is no remedy for this group. They are not eligible for TPS
                         since TPS is granted on the basis of a situation in the home country
                         which is not relevant in this case.
