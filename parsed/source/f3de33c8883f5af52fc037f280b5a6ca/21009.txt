 TEXT:
  USDA believes it should have access to $146 million in unspent funds.
 OMB disagrees.  I believe Glickman will send the President a note on this
 issue. Attached is a USDA background note explaing the issue in 3
 paragraphs. USDA notes that if we can free up this money, it frees up
 money for other important concerns like fod safety. They would obviously
 like us to note our agreement to OMB. ==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ==========

            USDA needs some assistance in resolving an issue which could alleviate some of the
    pressure on its fiscal year (FY) 1999 appropriations bill. Both the House and Senate versions of
    USDA's appropriations bill underfund many of our most important initiatives. These include
    items such as the Food Safety Initiative, Fund for Rural America, the research initiatives
    authorized in the new legislation recently signed by the President, the Special Supplemental
    Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and our Integrated Pest
    Management Initiatives for farmers. Further, since the President submitted the FY 1999 Budget
    in February 1998, conditions in rural America have deteriorated; and we need to reconsider our
    earlier proposals to reduce staffing in the Farm Service Agency.

           It would be very helpful if the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) would
    reconsider its decisions concerning unobligated balances from previous rural development
    programs which were transferred to and merged with the new Rural.Community Advancement
    Program (RCAP) and Rural Housing Assistance Grants Program (RHAG) by language in our
    Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations Act. There are $146 million of such balances. Funds for
    RCAP and RHAG are provided on the basis that they are available until expended. USDA's
    budget office and General Counsel believe this $146 million is available and could be used to
    alleviate some of the underfunding in the FY 99 appropriations bill. Senator Bumpers, ranking
    Democrat on Senate Ag Appropriations, also believes these funds are available and has written
    OMB in this regard. USDA wrote Jack Lew on June 17, 1998, asking for help on this issue.

            However, it appears that OMB staff believe that the transferred funds from previous
    balances are no longer available. Obviously, if we had this $146 million to help finance our
    rural development activities, this would have the affect of freeing up funds to pursue other
    important Administration priorities.
