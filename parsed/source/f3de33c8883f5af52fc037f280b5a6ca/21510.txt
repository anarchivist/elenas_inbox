TEXT:
I talked about Title IX before you came into Team Leaders. We are
basically ready to go -- DOD and DOJ have agreed on an exemption for
members of the armed forces and for civilians in DOD education programs
only if the program serves a military purpose.  We will also add an
exemption for the selection of foreigners for education programs
concerning national security or foreign policy (eg., if the CIA wants to
chose foreigners from a particular country, we won't stop them).

Julie suggested that we meet with civil rights groups before we announce
this, and I thought we should also double check with the women's groups.
Do you agree? Do you want to be there?
