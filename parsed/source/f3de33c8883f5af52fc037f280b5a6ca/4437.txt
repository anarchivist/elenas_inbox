TEXT:
At this weekend' s Conference of Mayors Exec. Committee meeting, Mayors
Archer, Morial and Webb complained that our welfare to work guidance is
too skewed toward states at the expense of mayors.  I suspect they've just
figured out that the money goes through the states to the PICS (so the
state does the plan) and that they are dependent on the state for the
match.

Archer will be in town on Friday and. would like to meet with Secretary
Herman and Bruce.  Paper is coming to me from Archer.   I think that we
should have the meeting at Labor. I don't think Bruce needs to
attend--Elena would be fine.  Let me know what you all think.
