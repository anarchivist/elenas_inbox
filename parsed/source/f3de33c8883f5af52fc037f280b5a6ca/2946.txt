TEXT:
larry haas tells me that the vp is doing the immigrant event thursday with
congressional members, advocates, and i think real people.  he was not
inclined to include mayors and i agreed for the reasons bruce and i talked
about yesterday--mainly that they think we should fund everything--restor
all the immigrant cuts. unless it's to our advantage to have the world
hear a bipartisan group of mayors on this, we should not include them.
