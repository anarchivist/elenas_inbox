                                       Crime and Drugs


March

         Prison Drug Testing Last year, the President pushed Congress to pass a provision
requiring states to drug test prisoners and parolees as a condition for receiving 1994 Crime Bill
Prison grant funding. Unfortunately, during the process Congress amended this provision to
preclude states from using prison grant funds to help pay for the drug testing. The President's
Anti-Gang Bill includes a provision permitting states to use 1994 Crime Bill funding for drug
testing.

         On December 12, 1996, the President announced that the Justice Department had
developed drug testing and sanction guidelines to assist states in meeting the new requirements.
The guidelines require states to implement a post-conviction program of controlled substance
testing, interventions, and sanctions with articulated policies and procedures by September I,
1998.

        These guidelines should be now be followed up with two actions:

        I)       Presidential Letter to Governors. President sends a letter to all 50 governors
        informing them that reducing cycle of drug abuse in our nation's criminal justice systems
        is one of his top priorities and he has every intention of making these deadlines a reality.
        He would seek their support in passing the Anti-Gang Bill provision, which would greatly
        assist them in achieving the mutual goal of breaking the cycle of crime and drugs.

        2)      Prison Drug Testing Initiative Director. President would announce that he has
        asked a high profile criminal justice expert/top professor-type (or Commission wi high
        profile Chair) to administer this program. Over the next 12 months, this Director will
        work with all 50 states to ensure that their drug testing plans are adequate and up to
        speed. This announcement will show Presidential commitment and action. Just as
        important, it takes control of the monitoring of states out of bowels of the Justice
        Department bureaucracy, where it would otherwise not occur.


        Safety Lock Event and Executive Order          (Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy
Event #1)     A provision in the President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Bill requires Federal
Firearms License Dealers to sell a safety lock with any handgun. To highlight this provision and
serve as an example, the President would announce that he is directing all federal law
enforcement agencies to require that handguns be issued with a safety lock (I believe ATF
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

already has this requirement). The President would sign the directive at a White House event
accompanied by the Bradys and law enforcement.

       The event could be held on March 30th, which is the 16th anniversary of Jim Brady's
shooting.


        Hard Liquor Advertising For years, the hard liquor industry has voluntarily agreed
not to show liquor ads on TV. Some companies have now broken that agreement. In
furtherance of his National Drug Control Strategy roll-out, the President would send a letter to
the FCC requesting that they consider restrictions on hard liquor advertising on television during
certain time periods.


        Sex Offender Registry President would visit the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Arlington, Virginia where he would take a tour offacility and announce
that the interim National Sex Offender Registration system -- which he directed the Attorney
General to develop in the June 21, 1996 Radio Address -- is now up and running.

        He would also announce that he is signing an Executive Order instructing the Attorney
General and the Secretary of Defense to insure that sex offenders released from Federal and
Military prisons are listed in the national registry.


        ABC Radio Anti-Drug Town Hall The President has already agreed to participate in a
radio town hall for ABC in Mid-March in which he would field questions and discuss youth drug
use with youth and parents.




         National Anti-Drug Media Campaign The President's FY 98 Budget Submission
includes $175 million for a national anti-drug media campaign directed towards our youth. This
initiative is the cornerstone behind the number one goal in the President's National Drug Control
Strategy -- to reduce youth drug use. The President and General McCaffrey have already
indirectly challenged the media to match our contribution dollar for dollar so that $350 million
would be dedicated to anti-drug ads. Unfortunately, we will not be able to expend any funds on
this initiative until we enact the appropriation bill. ONDCP can, however, expend discretionary
funds in their FY 97 budget to begin producing anti-drug ads.

       At a Rose Garden event, the President would kick-off his Administration's anti-drug
media campaign with one of the celebrities who has committed to appear in an ad. President
Clinton would also release a letter that he is sending to every network issuing his challenge that


                                                 2
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
they match our contribution and begin dedicating more air time to anti-drug ads (ONDCP is
currently reaching out to celebrities and sports figures such as Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, and
Tiger Woods to tape anti-drug ads).

        Anti-Gang Prosecutor Event (Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy Event #2)
The cornerstone of the President's Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy is a $200 million
anti-gang prosecution grant program. The President would meet with prosecutors from across
the country in the Oval Office where they would thank him for his strong support in fighting
gangs. The prosecutors -- Republican and Democrat -- would urge Congress to move quickly to
pass the President's bill.

         After schools Initiatives Event    (Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy Event #3).
To highlight his 1000 new after schools initiatives in his Anti-Gang Bill, the President would
visit a successful after schools program and meet with the kids who have been positively
impacted by the schools staying open in the evenings, on the weekends, and in the summer.
That day, he would also announce that HHS is providing several million dollars in grants from its
FY 97 appropriation for new After schoolsprograms across the country.


        Victims Constitutional Amendment In June 1996, the President announced his
support for a constitutional amendment for victims rights -- to guarantee victims the right to be
notified, to receive restitution, receive reasonable protection measures, and to be heard at
sentencing and parole hearings.

       At a White House event, the President would:

       1. Urge Congress to pass the Amendment quickly;

       2. Receive a report from the Attorney General -- in response to his June 25, 1996
       Directive -- outlining measures taken by the Justice Department to increase and improve
       Federal level victim's services and protections;

       3. Announce the creation of a Federal victim notification system; and

       4. Announce additional funding from the Victims Crime Fund -- which is larger than
       ever before -- that will be provided to victims services and shelters throughout the
       country.

        This event could occur on April 19, the third anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing
or during April 14-18, which is National Crime Victims Week.




                                                 3
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


        Mayor's Drug Conference In announcing the 1997 National Drug Control Strategy,
President Clinton stated that he will be convening a White House Mayors Conference on Drug
Control on May 21 st. This is in response to a request from Chicago Mayor Daley, who is
currently chair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

        The President could use that event to announce a new drug initiative or a development in
one of the other listed initiatives. For example, he could announce the Chair of the Prison Drug
Testing Program or kick-off his anti-drug media campaign.


       National Peace Officers' Memorial On May 15th, the President would speak on the
Mall to law enforcement and families in honor of National Peace Officers' Memorial Week. He
would urge Congress to pass his safety lock proposal so that more gun violence deaths can be
prevented.


        National Missing and Exploited Children Day May 16th. The President and the
First Lady would host an event in the Rose Garden honoring National Missing and Exploited
Children. John Walsh, Mark Klaas, Colleen Nick (who met with the President after her
daughter, Morgan, was reported missing) and others would be in attendance.

        The President would unveil a PSA -- in which he appears -- that would be used for
serious child kidnaping cases where the child is abducted by a stranger. The President would
also release a letter that he is sending to all 50 Governors asking them to post missing children
photos in all state government buildings and property, modeled after his 1996 Directive requiring
all Federal facilities to post such photos.


Summer

       Brady Law Supreme Court Case Late Spring/Summer. When the Supreme Court
decides the challenge to the Brady Law, assuming we lose, the President would hold an event at
the White House with law enforcement and the Bradys where he would announce:

       I)   Proposed legislation that he is sending to the Hill to address the Supreme Court case
               and that he is calling on Congress to immediately pass it;
       2) A letter from Reno and Rubin to chief law enforcement officers nationwide asking
       them to continue enforcing Brady checks; and that
       3) He has already received a signed pledge from numerous Police Chiefs and Sheriffs
       across the nation that they will continue to conduct Brady checks.



                                                4
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
        COPS Hiring Announcements Throughout the coming year, the Justice Department
will have several rounds of new COPS announcing. During 1997, 17,000 additional new
community police officers will be funded by the Justice Department.

        For the Third Anniversary of Crime Bill signing on September 13, 1997, the President
and the Attorney General would swear-in the "75,000th cop" signifying that the program is 3/4's
towards the President's goal of 100,000 new police officers in three years.

        Parental Responsibility Bill In a speech on youth violence and drugs, the President
would encourage more states and localities to adopt parental accountability or responsibility
laws, so that parents are held accountable for the acts of their children.

       Drug Strategy Letter Before Congress returns from their long August recess, the
President would send a letter to the Speaker and the Senate Majority Leader urging them to
ensure when they return that his drug budget is fully funded as they conclude the appropriations
process.




         Signing of Anti-Gang Bill! National Gang Tracking Network President Clinton
would travel to Boston to sign his Anti-Gang and Youth Violence legislation, the site of his
initial announcement. He would also announce that his National Gang Tracking Network is
now operating throughout the Northeast and other regions will soon be able to access it.

        First State-wide Implementation of 3-1-1 In response to a public safety crisis created
by clogged 9-1-1 services across the nation, on July 23, 1996, President Clinton asked the
Attorney General to work with the FCC, law enforcement and the telecommunications industry
to develop a national community policing number for non-emergency calls. On February 13,
1997, the FCC responded to the President by setting aside 3-1-1 for non-emergency public safety
use. With funding from the Justice Department, the City of Baltimore has already instituted a
3-1-1 system and it has been enormously successful in reducing 9-1-1 backlog.

         The President would travel to Colorado to announce that it is the first state to adopt
state-wide use of3-1-1 and that it will serve as a model for other states. He would urge every
state to adopt 3-1-1 by the year 2000.


Other Potential Report Announcements Throughout the Year.


      HUD One-Strike for Public Housing Report March. In March 1996, the President
announced the implementation of the One-Strike policy for public housing. HUD is starting to


                                                5
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

collect information on the number of public housing agencies that are implementing the policy.
In March, the HUD Secretary would provide the President with a one-year progress report on
One-Strike. If grant announcements were ready for the Public Housing Drug Elimination Grants
or Operation Safe Home, they could also be announced.

        Violence Against Women Report Summer. One of the most important and
far-reaching sections in the 1994 Crime Bill was the Violence Against Women Act. The
Attorney General would provide the President a report outlining its progress to date.


       Shaming Sentences. The President would encourage more states and localities to
support shaming sentences for minor offenses -- so that juveniles offenders are forced to
apologize in public and adults are morally condemned through public identification of their
non-violent acts.

          In a crime speech, the President would announce his continuing commitment to
.truth-in-sentencing for violent crimes and then pivot into his support for alternative sentencing
 when appropriate, such as shaming sentences, which instill the values of a community and deter
 illegal activity.


       New Law Enforcement Technology. The President would announce that his
Administration is ushering in a new age in police technology that will not only help prevent
crime but also make policing safer.

        Through this Administration's efforts, we are on the verge of a "smart gun" that can only
be fired by the actual gun owner; advanced "concealed weapons technology" that will keep
gun-toting criminals off our streets; "crime mapping" that will pinpoint crime patterl)s and reduce
crime like it did in New York; and "gun shot detection" which will help locate criminals. C    ....
and DNA technology that will locate the "real killers!!!")
