MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

RE:           DPC Weekly Report


       Education -- National Education Goals Panel: The National Education Goals Panel
released its annual progress report on Dec. 10. The report, which summarized previously
released data, highlighted improvements in the school readiness, math achievement, and
the participation of women and minorities in math arid science in higher education. The
Goals Panel also had a lengthy discussion of the future of the goals and the goals panel.
There is strong consensus on the panel that we should continue to pursue national
education goals after 2000, especially since the goals will not be met by that deadline.
There is also a pretty strong consensus to continue to have a bipartisan, intergovernmental
reporting panel, though critical Republican members including Engler and Goodling were
not present and have not weighed in on this. Finally, Sen. Bingaman urged that you
convene a summit in order to elevate the national goals and reenergize the process started
at the Charlottesville Summit. Gov. Hunt and members of the business community also
argued for some kind of high profile process that would engage the American public and
culminate in a set of national education goals. While these are appealing ideas and could
conceivably help restore some measure of bipartisanship to the education debate, we and
Secretary Riley believe that we must first determine that there will be significant support
from Republican governors and Jeffords and Goodling before proceeding supporting any
such effort by the Goals Panel.

        Education -- GED: In response to your inquiry on this matter, we have learned
that the American Council on Education is responsible for the developing and
administering the GED. There is interest in the Education Department in figuring out
how we might go about strengthening the GED, and DPC and Education Department staff
will soon begin to discuss this with ACE.

        Health Care -- CDC releases guidelines for HIV surveillance: This week, the CDC
released their draft guidelines to assist States in the design and implementation of new HIV
surveillance systems. Representatives from the HN /AIDS community were nervous about the
CDC's proposed recommendation to States that they use name based surveillance systems to
track the epidemic. Through discussions with HHS, we were able to ensure that CDC left States
with the option of creating surveillance systems that used utiique identifier codes that provide

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
been relatively well received by the AIDS community. However, because the confidentiality
issues associated with HIV surveillance are incredibly sensitive and of high interest to the
community, questions and concerns about the CDC draft guidance may be raised at your
meeting with the AIDS Council on December 18th. In response, you can indicate your
support for alternatives to name based reporting and explicitly indicate your support for
States like California, who are actively exploring developing these alternative systems.

        Health Care -- Meeting of the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults
with Disabilities: On Tuesday, the Vice, President will meet with the Presidential Task Force
on the Employment of Adults with Disabilities and accept their first report. Although a number
of the Task Force's recommendations require new investments and need to be considered within
the context of the budget process, many of the administrative actions they recommend can be
implemented immediately. As a result of this report, the Office of Personnel Management will
develop a plan to increase the representation of adults with disabilities in the Federal
workforce and the Small Business Administration will launch a new outreach campaign to
improve opportunities for Americans with disabilities. The Vice President will also take
the opportunity to r.eiterate the Administration's commitment to passing a strong
enforceable patients' bill of rights to improve the quality of care for people with disabilities
at Tuesday's meeting. This report lays a solid foundation for a number of disability
initiatives that are likely to be included in this year's budget, including funding for the
Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives Improvement Act.

       Health Care -- Swearing in of Dr. Jane Henney as FDA Commissioner: On
Tuesday, the Vice President will swear in Dr. Jane E. Henney, the first woman and first
oncologist to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. We expect a large
audience consisting of representatives of consumer protection groups and advocates for the
food, pharmaceutical, and device manufacture industries to attend.

        Health Care -- Dean Ornish Update: Following up on your interest in the status of
Dr. Ornish's request to establish a cost-effectiveness demonstration on programs like his
"Life Style Intervention," we obtained a commitment from Nancy Ann Min DeParle that
she would indicate her openness to and support for the type of demonstration that he seeks.
 She is meeting today (Friday) and, although no final agreement will be reached on the
scope, size and financing of the demonstration, we expect Dr. Ornish to be pleased with the
result of the meeting. We will stay on top of this issue to ensure that an acceptable final
outcome is reached.

        Crime -- Capital Punishment: This Sunday, the Justice Department will release a
bulletin on the death penalty indicating that in 1997, 17 states executed 74 prisoners. This is 29
more executions than in 1996, and the largest annual number since 1955 (76 executions). The
states with the highest number of execution were: Texas, 37; Virginia, 9; Missouri, 6; Arkansas
4; and Alabama, 3. All ofthose executed in 1997 were males, and by race: 45 were white; 27
were black; one was Asian and one was American Indian. Ofthis number, 5 were of Hispanic
descent. There were an additional 3,335 men and women on death row in 34 states and the
                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
races. This total includes 238 Hispanics and 44 women. Nearly two-thirds of inmates with
death sentences had previous felony convictions, including 9 percent with at least one prior
homicide conviction. The report also notes that as of November 30, 1998, 18 states had executed
58 inmates, with Texas and Virginia accounting for half the total (17 and 12, respectively).

        Welfare Reform -- Work Participation Rates: We now have in hand the very first
work participation data from the new welfare refoun law. The data show that 95 percent of
states met the first year requirement to have 25 percent of all families on welfare engaged in
work activities. These data are from the last quarter ofFY 1997, when the new work rates
applied to 38 states plus D.C. (the remaining states implemented the new law after March 1997
and didn't have to meet the work rates until FY 1998). Nevada and D.C. failed to meet the rate,
although they may make the target based on additional infounation they are providing to HHS.

        As you may recall, the participation rate measures the proportion of families on welfare
with an adult in work activities for at least 20 hours per week. States get a credit for caseload
reductions to help account for people who leave the rolls and go to work. States are also .
required to ensure that 75 percent of two parent families have a parent who works at least 35
hours per week. Only 20 of the 39 jurisdictions met this test, which applies to 7 percent of.
welfare families .. As required by law, HHS will impose financial penalties of up to 5 percent of
a state's TANF grant for failing to meet the work rates, but a state will have an opportunity to
enter into a corrective compliance plan which, ifit succeeds in increasing work rates to the
required level, will preclude the penalty.

         Welfare Reform -- Positive Teen Birth Trends Continue: A new study by the Centers
for Disease Control shows encouraging news about teen birth rates. The study provides new
detail regarding the previously reported 15 percent decline in the national teen birth rate from
1991 to 1997. The most striking finding was the decline in the rate of second births to teens,
which fell 21 percent from 1991 to 1996. Second births comprise about one-fifth of total teen
births. 'In addition, the report showed declines in teen births for all races and ethnic groups and
in all states,

        Children and Families -- New Data on Infant Mortality and Other Health
Indicators: A new study published in the journal of Pediatrics, based on 1997 data compiled
by the Centers for Disease Control, reported new data on rates of infant mortality, low
birthweight, teen births, and life expectancy. First, the study reported that U.S. infant mortality
rates reached their lowest level in history last year. The 1997 infant mortality rate -- a measure
of the number of deaths. before a baby turns 1 -- was 7.1 deaths per 1,000 births, which was about
3 percent lower than the 1996 rate of7.3 deaths per 1,000 live births. The drop in infant deaths
came despite a 7.5 percent increase in the number oflow birthweight babies, and an increase of
about 2 percent in the number of births by women late in their childbearing years. In addition,
the study reported that births to teen-age mothers fell in 1997 for the sixth consecutive year to
52,9 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 -- 3 percent lower than the 1996 rate of 54.4 and 15
percent lower than the 1991 rate of 62.1, Finally, the study reported that Americans' average life
expectancy rose to an all-time high of 76 Yz years. This increase is due in part to falling death

                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
from HIV or AIDS dropped by 47 percent in 1997. The most dramatic improvement in life
expectancy was among black males, whose expectancy increased by 1.2 years to 67.3.
         Abortion -- New Abortion Study: This week, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI)
released a new study on abortion incidence and services based on a survey of all known
abortion providers in the United States. The study showed that, from 1992 to 1996, the
number of abortions performed fell from 1,529,000 to 1,366,000, and the abortion rate
decreased from 26 to 23 per 1,000 women aged 15-22. In that period, the number of
facilities providing abortions fell sharply -- by 14 percent, with the greatest decline among
hospitals and physicians' offices rather than clinics. The AGI study concluded, however,
that factors other than access to abortion -- such as the decreasing rate of unintended .
pregnancies -- have had more influence on the abortion rate. The study also examined the
prevalence of dilation and extraction procedures (so-called "partial birth" abortions), and
found that, in 1996, an estimated 650 of these procedures were performed (out of a total of
1.36 million abortions), with the large majority ofthese performed at 20 to 24 weeks .

       . Community Empowerment -- Community Development Financial Institutions Fund
(CDFI): The Treasury Department recently provided the DPC with summary statistics on the
CDFI awards made during the first three years of funding (1996, 1997, and 1998). In Putting
People First, you called for the creation of "a network of community development banks to
provide small loans to low-income entrepreneurs and homeowners in inner cities." Since its
creation, the CDFI Fund has made a total of 196 awards to 164 institutions. Of the institutions
receiving awards, 139 were already established, and 25 were startup. Ofthe startup institutions,
9 were full-service financial institutions -- banks, bank holding companies, and credit unions --
and 16 were more specialized financial institutions such as micro enterprise funds, venture capital
funds, and business loan funds. Below is a detailed chart summarizing the statistics on the
CDFI awards:
