Attached are q's and a's for today's education event.

With respect to the prospect of a House vote on Labor/HHS:
1. There appears to be no chance of a vote today--there are no votes
until 5:00 at the earliest, and the Rules committee hasn't taken this up
yet. The earliest Rules will deal with this is at 5:00 or later.

2. Appropriations staff are not preparing for a floor vote; they are
continuing to work on preconferencing with the Senate. Obviously they
will shift gears if they need to, but that's not where they are right now.

3.  IF there is a vote on Labor/HHS in the next couple of days, we need to
blast the bill.   It will provide some funding for LIHEAP and Summer Jobs,
but nothing additional for education. And we know we are going to do
better, since the appropriators are adding somewhere in the neighborhood
of $4 billion to the House committee bill, and giving us a lot of what we
have asked for.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:


Q.   IS THE PRESIDENT THREATENING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IF THE
     REPUBLICANS DO NOT GIVE HIM THE EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT HE
     WANTS?

A.   No, he is asking that they spend a day working cooperatively and productively to address
     the needs of our schools, to provide children with better-trained teachers, smaller classes,
     modem classrooms and technology, and after-school programs. He is asking that they
     work on a cooperative basis. The passage of the higher education legislation earlier this
     week is a demonstration that bipartisanship can yield results. He is asking Congress to
     learn from that lesson, and do the same with elementary and secondary education.


Q.   HASN'T THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD VETO THE LABOR-HHS
     APPROPRIATIONS BILL?

A.   Yes, the President made it clear on July 14 that the House appropriations bill was
     unacceptable, and that he would veto it ifit came to him. He has indicated that the
     Senate Committee version is a step in the right direction, but is still deficient. He is
     asking the Republican leadership in Congress to work with him and with their
     Democratic colleagues to develop a plan that we can all rally behind.


Q.   DIDN'T YOU ACTUALLY LOSE YOUR EDUCATION INITIATIVES WHEN YOUR
     TOBACCO EFFORT STALLED?

A.   First, our of all of our education initiatives, only the Class Size Reduction proposal was
     funded out of projected tobacco revenues. Funding to help modernize schools, put
     technology in the classroom and train teachers in how to use it, provide after-school
     programs, expand charter schools, was not funded out of tobacco revenues, and is part of
     the President's balanced budget proposal. Second, when Congress wants to accomplish
     something, it finds ways. For example, many different savings proposal were cobbled
     together the fund the highway bill earlier this year. That kind of effort should be put into
     education, too.



Q.   IS IT REALLY FAIR TO SAYTHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE NOTHING ON
     EDUCATION? ISN'T THEIR AGENDA JUST DIFFERENT (EDUCATION
     SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, D.C. VOUCHERS, BLOCK GRANTS)?

                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
     so it is critical that we invest in improving them. The gimmicks that the Republicans
     have put forward--including the block grant proposal (Dollars to the Classroom) the
     House voted on recently, would actually rob public schools of resources, and reduce
     accountability.


Q.   THE REPUBLICAN TAX BILL HAS A SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION COMPONENT.
     DO YOU SUPPORT THAT?

A.   The tax bill threatens Social Security by raiding the surplUS. The President's school
     construction tax credit is fully paid for in his budget. If the Republican leadership would
     like to join us in Saving Social Security First, then we would be happy to sit down to
     discuss different ways to address the school construction and renovation needs of the
     Nation.


Q.   THE CONGRESS JUST PASSED A HIGHER EDUCATION BILL WITH STRONG
     BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. ISN'T IT ALSO QUITE POSSIBLE THAT A NUMBER
     OF EDUCATION BILLS SUPPORTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PASS IN
     THE NEXT WEEK: HEAD START REAUTHORIZATION, CHILD LITERACY,
     CHARTER SCHOOLS? DOES THAT MAKE THIS A DO-SOMETHING
     CONGRESS?

A.   I hope they pass them. But it would be the ultimate in hypocrisy to pass them, but not
     fund them. And while these steps are important and will help, the best way for Congress
     to help strengthen our schools and begin to provide our students with a world-class
     education is to provide our students with smaller classes and modem school buildings.
     That's what we are talking about today.
