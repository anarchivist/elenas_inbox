1.      Counteradvertising: At the event, the President would direct HHS to: (1) designate the
CDC's Media Campaign Resource Center as a National Clearinghouse on Tobacco
Counteradvertising; (2) collect and disseminate a package of the "top-10" advertisements for
preventing youth smoking, and make these available to states and organizations for television
placement free of charge; and (3) make effective anti-tobacco curriculum available to every
school.

We could invite supermodel Christy Turlington and musical group "Boyz II Men" to participate
in the event, both of whom have already demonstrated their commitment to this effort by making
public service announcements targeting youth smoking that are available through the CDC (these
ads would be among the "top 10" package). The President could also urge the entertainment
industry to do its part in reducing youth smoking, by urging broadcasters to air public service
announcements targeting youth smoking, actors to speak out on the subject, and writers and
directors to reduce the portrayal of smoking in movies and films.

2.      DOD: The President would unveil the DOD's new comprehensive military-wide
anti-tobacco plan. This plan includes covering over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapies
under military health care coverage, a military-wide counteradvertising campaign, incorporating
anti-tobacco messages into education and training programs for military personnel (cost: $60
million). At the event, the President could be joined by the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other high-ranking military officers.

Military personnel have higher rates of smoking than the general population (31.7 percent), and
DOD tobacco-related health care costs are approximately $1.3 billion per year. Their goal is to
be smoke free by 2010.

3.     OSHA: The President would sign an Executive Order directing OSHA to issue within
one year a standard establishing a smoke-free workplace for all private sector employees. ETS
exposure in the workplace poses significant risks to employees who are non-smokers, including
lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems. This standard would be similar to the
August 1997 Executive Order banning smoking in Federal building.

OSHA has been working since 1991 on a standard regulating all indoor air quality (which
includes environmental tobacco smoke and air pollutants such as harmful bacteria and hazardous
chemicals). They are years away from completing this standard, largely because they do not
have sufficient scientific evidence to justify the regulation of indoor air pollutants. However,
they believe that if the President ordered a separate standard only on ETS, more resources would
be devoted to the project and they could finish it within 12-18 months.
