MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                         Jack Gibbons
                              Assistant to the President for Science and Technology

                              Elena Kagan
                              Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:                      Cloning Policy Options

Two upcoming events create the need to develop a position on legislation banning the cloning of
human beings. First, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) is about to
complete the review you requested of the ethical and legal issues associated with cloning human
beings. On Saturday, June 7, at its final public meeting, NBAC is expected to vote in favor of a
legislative ban. Second, France has proposed that the Denver Summit communique include a
paragraph urging countries to pass domestic legislative bans, and to work together toward a
global ban.

We recommend: (1) that you support domestic legislation banning human cloning, and that you
announce specific legislation at the top of your June 10th press conference; aJ?d (2) that the U.S.
support France's proposed cloning paragraph while insisting on critical modifications.


DISCUSSION

NBAC's Findings and Recommendations

In its draft final report, NBAC unanimously concludes that "it is morally unacceptable for
anyone ... to attempt to create a child" using the technology that created Dolly the sheep --
that is, the transfer of the nucleus from an adult somatic (non egg or sperm) cell into an
enucleated egg. NBAC bases this conclusion on safety concerns, finding that the technology is
"likely to involve substantial risk to the potential child." The report also states that "serious
ethical concerns ... require a great deal more widespread and careful thought and public
deliberation before this technology should be used."

NBAC also concludes, however, that other forms of "human cloning" -- such as the cloning of
DNA sequences, cell lines, and tissues (which do not involve the creation of entire human
beings) -- are scientifically important and not ethically problematic. Moreover, NBAC finds
that animal cloning by somatic cell nuclear transfer is ethically acceptable and promises
important benefits. Hence, the Commission cautions that any restrictions on cloning should not


                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
The Commission notes that current restrictions effectively prohibit federally funded and
regulated entities from attempting to clone a human being through somatic cell nuclear transfer.
However, fertility clinics and other privately-funded clinical and research establishments face no
prohibition on human cloning, and NBAC questions whether some of these organizations will
adhere to a voluntary moratorium.

Accordingly, NBAC's draft final report calls for carefully-worded national legislation prohibiting
anyone from "attempting to create a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques."
The Commission specifies that the legislation should include a sunset provision and that, prior to
the sunset date, an oversight body should review and report on the status of somatic cell nuclear
transfer technology and the ethical and social issues associated with its use in humans. NBAC
also recommends that the U.S. cooperate with other countries to enforce mutually-supported
cloning restrictions.


National Legislation

We recommend that you embrace NBAC's proposal to establish a narrowly crafted time-limited
legislative moratorium. Legislation is the only way to establish a comprehensive, enforceable
prohibition on cloning entire human beings in all publicly and privately funded research and
clinical activities. If carefully written, it will not preclude important research.

Reaction to proposed legislation will be mixed. A national and international consensus is
emerging that attempting to apply the technology used to clone Dolly to humans is morally
wrong. The American Medical Association has conveyed this view to NBAC, and the World
Medical Association has issued a similar statement. Given NBAC's recommendation, we
expect many in the scientific and ethics communities to accept a legislative moratorium.

But some who agree that cloning a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer is morally
unacceptable will oppose a legislated moratorium. In particular, the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries strongly oppose legislation. These two industries are deeply
concerned that a legislative debate will produce broadly drawn language that impairs critical
research. Some academic researchers may share this view. Fertility clinics may also oppose
legislation, but to date have not signaled a position.

Finally, some in the right-to-life community will argue from the other side that NBAC's proposed
approach does not go far enough. This community will push for a comprehensive ban on the
creation of embryos -- through any means -- for research purposes (i.e. not for the purposes of
creating a child), a restriction you have applied to federally-funded research. This is an issue
NBAC declined to review and that we do not recommend revisiting it in this context.

We recommend that you announce your support for legislation and propose specific legislative
language on June 10, at your scheduled press conference, three days after NBAC's
recommendation will become public. We anticipate that the release ofNBAC's report will
your leadership on the issue and carefully frame the legislative debate, making clear the value of
biotechnology research while prohibiting an unethical use of a specific technology.

Group of Eight Statement on Cloning

France has proposed a paragraph for inclusion in the G-8 communique embracing national and
intrenational bans on "reproductive human cloning." Germany will support the statement; Canada
will support it with some modification.

U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries strongly oppose including any paragraph on
cloning in the communique. They fear that it will not be carefully drafted and may inadvertently
extend to the cloning of DNA, cells, and tissues as well as entire human beings. Further,
industry is concerned a statement on cloning could ultimately provide cover for protectionist
efforts to restrict U.S. biotechnology products and activities.

Nevertheless, we recommend that the Administration support the French proposal with critical
modifications. Specifically, we suggest that the U.S. insist on changes to: (1) affirm the
potential medical and agricultural benefits of cloning technology; (2) limit the prohibition to "the
use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to create a child;" and (3) propose a time-limited
moratorium instead of a ban. USDA and HHS support this position.

Attachment

We have taken note with great concern of recent scientific experiments which could open the way
to reproductive human cloning. We agree that the prohibition of any form of reproductive
human cloning needs both strict domestic legislation and close international cooperation to
adapt current international law. We are encouraged by the reflections underway within
national ethics committees as well as in various regional and international fora. We are
determined to give a strong impetus to their work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a
universal ban on reproductive human cloning.

Our Proposed Substitute Language

  We have taken note that further development of the technology that enabled the recent cloning of
  a sheep offers the promise of enormous medical and agricultural benefits. We have also taken
  note with great concern that this scientific advance could open the way to using this technology
  (by which we mean somatic cell nuclear transfer technology) to create a child. We agree on the
  need for appropriate domestic legislation and close international cooperation to prohibit the use
. of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child while countries explore ethical and scientific
  implications in greater depth. We are encouraged by the reflections already underway within
  national ethics committees as well as in various regional and international fora. We are
  determined to give a strong impetus to their work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a
  universal moratorium on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child.
