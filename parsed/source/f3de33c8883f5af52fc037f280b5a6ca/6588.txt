MEMORANDUM FORTHE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report



        Education -- TIMSS results: You will be meeting with a group of business,
education and math and science leaders to discuss the nation's response to the TIMSS
results on March 16. This meeting will provide an opportunity to highlight your
education agenda, and focus the nation's attention the need for improvement in education.
This is especially timely and important because some in the education community are
already beginning to dismiss or explain away the significance of the low test scores.

       Education -- Senate Education Bill: Senator Daschle and other Democrats
introduced a comprehensive education bill this week. The bill is based on the
Administration's education agenda, and includes provisions on education opportunity
zones, school modernization, class size reduction, expanding after-school care, and
promoting the effective use of technology in the classroom with a focus on teacher training.

        Education -- Opportunity Zones: Mr. Clay has agreed to introduce your Education
Opportunity Zones legislation in the House, and to try to recruit bipartisan sponsors.
DPC and Education staff are working with Clay to finalize the legislation, and expect to
have it ready for transmittal within the next several weeks.

       Campaign Finance Reform -- Free TV Petition: With the defeat of McCain-Feingold
we are now focusing our energies on your free television time request before the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC). This week Senator Roth became the first Republican
Senator to tell the FCC he would support their efforts to create a free television system for
candidates for federal office. The FCC has now received letters of support from 83 Members of
Congress, including Chris Shays. The Commission continues to seek additional support from
Republican Senators, specifically focusing on Senators Jeffords and Thompson. However,
Senators McCain and Bums are planning to offer an amendment to the supplemental
appropriationslIMF bill to prohibit the FCC from imposing a free time requirement. In addition,
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

 all the Republicans on the House Commerce Committee have written the FCC in opposition to
 your request that the FCC begin a rulemaking procedure.

         HousingfWelfare -- Housing Vouchers: The National Association of Counties
 (NACO) has announced their support for your plan to create 100,000 new housing vouchers,
 specifically citing your proposal to target 50,000 of these vouchers for individuals moving from
 welfare-to-work.

          EEOC -- Gingrich testimony at Hearing. On Tuesday, Newt Gingrich testified at an
 EEOC oversight hearing and expressed his support for the Administration's proposed increase in
 funding for the EEOC. However, he also made clear that his support is contingent on the EEOC
 not using any of its FY99 money to support "testing" for employment discrimination. Gingrich
 also made a very strong statement opposing class actions and pattern or practice cases generally.
 Gingrich's rhetorical push was toward using the agency's enforcement money to handle cases of
 "actual victims" of discrimination, rather than "creating cases" (testing) or class actions. He did
 seem to concede, however, that testing could be warranted where there were strong indications
 that the employer might be unlawfully discriminating. Acting Chair Igasaki made clear that
 though the agency was in the middle of a small pilot program to determine how best to use
 testing in the employment context, their FY99 budget request did not include any money for
 testers.

         Crime -- COPS: On Thursday, the COPS Office announced $31 million in grants
. awarded to 186 law enforcement agencies in small towns across the country. The grants will
  fund 467 full-time and 67 part-time officers.

         Drugs -- Study on Crack, Powder Cocaine, and Heroi~: This week, the Justice
 Department released a study comparing drug use and purchase patterns among arrestees in six
 cities. The report released by the National Institute of Justice found that within any given city,
 drug use and drug markets varied substantially among the three drugs studied -- crack, powder
 cocaine, and heroin. Heroin users were the most likely to be daily users, followed by crack users
 (40 to 50 percent identified as daily users), and cocaine users (10 to 40 percent). A significant
 number of arrestees identified public assistance as their primary source of income. In addition, a
 substantial percentage of crack users in particular lived on the streets or in shelters prior to their
 arrest. The cities studied were: Chicago, Manhattan, San Antonio, Washington, DC, and
 Portland, Oregon.
