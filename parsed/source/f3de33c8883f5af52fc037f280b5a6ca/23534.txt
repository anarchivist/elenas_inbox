      PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
      RADIO ADDRESS ON WELFARE REFORM
      THE WHITE HOUSE
      April 9, 1999

              Good morning. Today, I want to talk to you about our continuing
      efforts to break the cycle of dependency and make responsibility and work
      a way of life for all Americans.

              Work is more than just a weekly paycheck -- it is at the heart of
      our way of life. Work lends purpose and dignity to our lives, and
      instills in our children the basic values that built our nation.  But for
      too long, too many Americans were trapped in a broken welfare system that
      exiled generation after generation from the mainstream of American life by
      cutting them off from the w?rld of work.

              I took office determined to change that.  From giving states the
      flexibility they needed to make welfare a second chance, not a way of life
      ... to signing the historic bipartisan Welfare Reform bill that ended
      welfare as we knew it ... to launching the Welfare to Work partnership to
      create private sector jobs for welfare recipients, we have made remarkable
      progress.

              Today, I am pleased to announce that since 1993, we have cut the
      welfare rolls nearly in half, by a record 6.5 million people. Thanks to a
      strong economy and the strong efforts of the private sector, the number of
      Americans who are beginning to replace welfare checks with pay checks has
      tripled since 1992.  I am proud to announce that we in the national
      government are doing our part to help, surpassing the goal we set for
      ourselves by hiring almost 12,000 welfare recipients in just two years.
"

            You can see evidence of our progress in communities across the
    country. You can see it in hard-pressed neighborhoods where bus drivers
    who used to pass by empty stations now report that their buses are filled
    with people on their way to work. You can see it on inner city streets
    where new store-front tax preparing businesses are helping people file
    their income tax returns -- some for the first time in their lives.

            Reforming our broken welfare system was the right thing to do
    now we must finish the job.  Today, I am pleased to unveil the final
    welfare reform rules that we envisioned in 1996. The new regulations
    enforce strict work requirements and hold states accountable for moving
    people from the welfare rolls to the workplace.  Just as important, the
    new regulations encourage states to help families pay for child care,
    transportation, and job-retention services.

            These final welfare reform regulations are a milestone in our
    efforts to restore responsibility and make work a way of life again for
    all Americans. But to finish the job of welfare reform, we must redouble
    our efforts. Now, in this time of great prosperity, with our economy
    booming and our confidence high, we cannot afford to leave anyone behind.

             One of the biggest obstacles facing all working families is finding
    child care they can afford and trust.   I have proposed a comprehensive
    plan to make child care better, safer, and more affordable.   I am pleased
    that the Senate recently ,approved with bipartisan support $5 billion in
    new funding that could provide child care assistance for about 850,000
    more children over the next five years.   I hope this is the year the
    Congress takes action to give AmericaO,s working families the child care
    support they need to thrive.

            Finally, we cannot finish the job of welfare reform without doing
    more to help people who have the hardest time moving from welfare to
    work. Very often these people live in the poorest neighborhoods, and have
    the poorest job skills.  Some have never worked in their adult lives. The
    Labor DepartmentO,s Welfare to Work program is already helping long-term
    welfare recipients like these to move into the world of work. But we must
    do more. That is why I calIon the Congress to pass my plan to invest
    another $1 billion in this vitally important program, and to fully fund my
    proposal to provide transportation grants and housing vouchers that will
    help more Americans leave welfare behind for a brighter future.

            With these steps, we can make the legacy of welfare dependency a
    memory of the 20th Century -- and build a community of work and
    responsibility in the 21st Century.

           Thanks for listening.
