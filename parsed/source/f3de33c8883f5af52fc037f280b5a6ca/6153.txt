TEXT:
Secretary Shalala has just. sent the President a seven page memo on welfare
reform, outlining what states are doing under TANF, what is known about
the impacts on recipients, and what next steps could be taken to support
low income workers.   It is a surprisingly factual and nonbiased account.
What's annoying, of course, is that they although they told us they were
working on it, they refused to share anything until the memo magically
popped out of the Secretary's office this afternoon.

Some of the information -- about publicly available studies and caseload
trends -- we have already provided to the President.  The memo does
contain an analysis of the new quarterly data from the states, which HHS
had only partially shared with us.

All and all, the memo shows how much Shalala has gotten on the bandwagon
-- saying there's been "no race to the bottom" and there's "little
evidence of extreme hardship."   If this memo is the basis of the
Secretary's February 6th speech to the American Enterprise Institute -- I
will check -- it should be fine.   (I say this with the caveat that we need
to review this -- and the attachments, which were missing in our copy
in more detail.)   We will make sure you have a complete copy, if you do
not already, as soon as we do.
