Subject:         Revised SAP for HR956, Drug-Free Communities Program

DOJ believes HR 956 presents a greater Establishment Clause problem than
they first thought and propose the following SAP on the bill. The
original version said "support if amended".

Comments are needed no later than 1:30 PM today.


H.R. 956 - Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997
(Portman (R) Ohio and 49 cosponsors)

The Administration does not support enactment of H.R. 956 in its current
form, because proposed Section 1032 appears to condition grant eligibility
on whether coalition applicants include representatives of religious
organizations as members.  By conditioning the grant of a governmental
benefit on the inclusion of a religious organization in the coalition
receiving the benefit, the bill raises very serious concerns under the
Establishment Clause of the Constitution.

The Administration would support enactment of H.R. 956 if it were amended
to address this concern. The Administration urges that H.R. 956 not be
considered under suspension of the rules unless the version of the bill
considered by the House address this concern.
