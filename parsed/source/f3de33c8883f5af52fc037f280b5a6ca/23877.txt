TO:                             Stephanie Streett
                                Assistant to the President
                                Director of Presidential Scheduling

FROM:                           Bruce Reed
                                Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and
                                Director of the Domestic Policy Council

REQUEST:                        National Association of Police Organizations' (NAPO) Top
                                Cops Event

PURPOSE:                       To honor police officers, selected by NAPO as TOP COPS,
                               for their courage and heroism in the line of duty.

BACKGROUND:                    NAPO is the second largest rank and file police
                               organization, and represents more than 220,000 sworn law
                               enforcement officers from 4,000 police associations and
                               unions across the country. The organization fights for the
                               rights of law enforcement officers through federal
                               legislation, legal advocacy and education. The TOP COPS
                               Awards pay tribute to law enforcement officers from across
                               the country for outstanding service to their communities
                               during the preceding year. The TOP COPS are nominated
                               by fellow officers and are selected from hundreds of
                               nominations by an awards committee.

                               NAPO has been extremely supportive of the President and
                               the Administration's anti-crime agenda, and this is their
                               most significant annual event.

PREVIOUS PARTICIPATION:        The President attended the First Annual Top Cops Awards
                               in 1994. He has held Rose Garden ceremonies honoring
                               the Top Cops each year since then.

DATE AND TIME:                 Thursday, October 21, 1999 for White House Event
                               [Could also do WH event on Friday, October 22, 1999 if
                               necessary, or he could attend the ceremony that evening.]
