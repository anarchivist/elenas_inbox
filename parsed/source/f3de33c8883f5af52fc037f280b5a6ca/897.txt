TEXT:
Mrs. Clinton would like to meet with us (and Bruce) on Friday afternoon
(tentatively scheduled for 3:30pm) to go over our ideas and progress on
the WH Conference. We can discuss the interagency meeting you chaired and
the charge that will be issued to the Departments throught the executive
memorandum, which, by Friday, I assume will have gone out.

Regarding the structure of the Conference itself, Melanne and I think that
we should present to her some of our specific ideas of participants and
presenters.  Toward that end, I will compile a list of those most
recommended thus far for our meeting tomorrow.  One thing we might
recommend is for Mrs. Clinton to convene a small group of experts in the
next two weeks to get their input on how we structure the first panel of
experts and, in particular, who are those people most able to present
current research in an understandaple, compelling way.
