         REMARKS TO THE SECOND WORLD CONGRESS OF EDUCATION
                            INTERNATIONAL
                           WASHINGTON, D.C.
                              JULY 29, 1998

        Good Morning. I am delighted to join this Second World Congress of Education
International on your final day in Washington. I hope you've had a successful meeting and are
preparing to go home energized, with a renewed commitment to our children and their future.

        It is always an honor for me to meet with the world's teachers. As President, I have had
the privilege of visiting schools all across America and around the world. And wherever I go --
from the Kisowera School in rural Uganda to the Mangueira school in inner city Rio de Janeiro --
I have met teachers whose dedication to their students is nothing short of heroic. Men and
women for whom kindling the spark of possibility in every child -- from the girl who dreams of
being the first in her struggling family to go to college to that once-in-a-career math prodigy --
isn't just a job, but a vital mission. I know there are many more like them -- beginning with the
educators in this room. So I thank all of you and the 23 million colleagues you represent all
around the world for making the education of our children your life's work.

       We are living in an era of unprecedented hope and possibility. The Cold War has ended,
giving way to peaceful democratic revolutions on nearly every continent on Earth. A
technological revolution is sweeping all across the globe, changing the way so many of us live
and work; binding our economies even closer together; making our world seem even smaller.
Today, there are 100 million people connected to the Internet. In just three years, that number
could grow to more than 700 million.

        But with all these hopeful changes come new challenges. We all know that new
democracies must be carefully nurtured by their citizens if they are to take root and thrive. We
all know that with technology advancing at rapid speed, the best jobs, the best opportunities of
the future will be available only to those with the skills and knowledge to take advantage of
them; that if we do not take action, dangerous opportunity gaps between those people and those
nations with these skills and those without could grow and deepen.

        The best way to meet these challenges -- to strengthen democracy and to strengthen our
nations for the 21 st Century -- is to strengthen education around the world. As we have learned
from recent events in Asia, a nation's economic health depends on the health of its trading
partners around the world. It is in every nation's interest to ensure every other nation's
economic health. To do that, we must use education to help all people lift themselves out of
poverty and into the middle class. Where once we focused all our development efforts on the
construction pftractor factories and power plants, today, we must invest in the power of the
human mind, in the potential of every single one of our children. A world-class education for all
children is essential to combating the ignorance, prejudice and fear that have undermined
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

freedom, to creating global prosperity and a worldwide middle class, to fulfilling the most basic
needs of the human spirit.

         That is why the 21 st Century must be the Century of Education. That is why the new
century must be the Century of the Teacher. Throughout my career, first as governor of a small
state, and now as President of the United States, I have made education my top priority. I want
to tell you about what I believe every nation can and must do to strengthen education. I want to
talk about what we are doing to provide every American at every stage in life a world-class
education.

        First, we have recognized that a college education is becoming more essential than ever in
our global economy. We have made the first two years of college entirely free to every student
who his willing to work and study hard. And through expanded low-cost student loans, tax
credits and deductions, we are making all forms of higher education more affordable for all
Americans.

        Second, we are working to bring high national standards of academic excellence to our
schools. Many of your countries already have national standards. We don't. I believe that so
many students from around the world outperformed Americans in the Third International Math
and Science Study did so because their countries set the bar high, challenged them to master
rigorous and advanced material, and used national tests to ensure that they did. I want to do the
same in America. With high national standards in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math,
America, too, can give parents the tools they need to make sure our children are mastering the
basics.

        Third, we know that good teachers are the key to good schools. That is why we are
"Yorking to reward and honor the most innovative, inspirational and successful teachers in our
classrooms and to recruit more of our best and brightest to enter this important profession. Next,
we are working to create safer, more disciplined learning environments by modernizing our
schools and reducing class size. Weare working hard to prepare our children for the demands
of the Information Age by connecting every classroom to the Internet and training teachers in
these new technologies. And finally, we are working to end the worst and most harmful
practices of the past -- to abolish social promotion so that no more children are passed from grade
to grade without learning the material first.

        Today, there is a vigorous debate going on in our Congress over the nature and extent of
our responsibilities to our children and our public schools. There are some in the other party
who don't see eye-to-eye with me on honoring our commitment to our public schools. Even as
we recognize the importance of raising academic standards and challenging all our students to
meet them, there are those who would prohibit national tests in our schools -- including those
who voluntarily decide to adopt them. Even as more studies confirm what we had already
suspected about the importance of early childhood development, some on the other side would
deny Head Start opportunities to 25,000 disadvantaged children. Even as the greatest number of
children since the Baby Boom are enrolling in our schools, some would weaken our efforts to
recruit new, highly qualified teachers. Even as hundreds ofthousands of high-paying, high-tech
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

jobs all across America and around the world go begging for workers, some would cut
investments in educationtechno\ogy and technology training for teachers.

        And what seems most shortsighted of all, there are some who are trying to kill one
America's most successful efforts to provide on-the-job training for young people. For a
generation, legislators from both parties have supported a Summer Jobs program that has helped
millions of our most disadvantaged young people experience the rewards and responsibilities of a
regular job and a regular paycheck. Our summer jobs program honors the values we Americans
cherish most -- hard work, responsibility, opportunity. Ifwe truly honor responsibility, then we
must help those young people who want to take responsibility for their lives find the jobs that
will help them succeed. Ifwe say we honor opportunity, then we must bring the opportunity of
a summer job to every child who is willing to work hard.

       I will not allow any of these setbacks to our children and American education. I will not
allow America to abandon our vital mission of preparing our children for the world of the 21 st
Century. I will not allow our 21 st Century children to enter the future with 20th Century skills.

        In all my travels at home and abroad, I have made a point of visiting schools because I
believe that you can find out a lot about a country's future from its public schools. Does every
child -- boy and girl; rich and poor -- have the same opportunity to learn? Are they engaged by
patient, well-trained, and inspiring teachers? Are they learning the skills they need to hold good
jobs in the future, to meet the demands of the world economy? Do they have opportunities to go
to college? Are the schools themselves safe, spacious and well-kept?

         I believe that, together, we can build a future where the answer to all of these questions is
"yes." I believe we can build a future where every child in every comer of the world has the
skills, the opportunity, the education to fulfill his greatest God-given potential. I know this
because our teachers are leading the way. When he came to the White House to be honored as
our national teacher of the year, Philip Bigler said that "to be a teacher is to be forever an
optimist." I thank every one of you for that unshakeable optimism, for believing in every child's
potential to make the future even more glorious than our present. Thank you. God Bless you all.
