TEXT:
Janet Murguia, Scott Fleming, Barbara Chow and I continued to flesh out
our strategy for Thursday's anticipated floor vote on Goodling's test
bill.  Here are the key points, including a few calls for each of you.

1. Riley is set to speak to the Democratic Caucus on Wednesday.   His job
is make the point for unity on political and process grounds.  Scott and I
will work to make sure he doesn't use this as an opportunity to make the
case for the tests; if he does this, it will backfire.

2. Riley and/or Scott will nail down Clay and Martinez to speak out in
support of Riley at the Caucus meeting.

3. Riley will be making a series of calls--to Waters, Becerra, Owens
(surprisingly, Owens signed the minority report on the Goodling bill,
sticking with the other D's), to keep them and the caucuses on board; to
Obey; to Stenholm and other Blue Dogs

4. Barbara Chow will call Bob Matsui, in an effort to enlist his support
in getting Patsy Mink to stay with us (we lost her at mark-up). Scott
Fleming will remind her staff that Mink was supportive of the tests when
Riley testified before the committee--in an effort to appeal to
consistency.

5. Bruce--Janet thinks you should call Tim Romer and Cal Dooley. Dooley
was with us in the Fall, and needs to be shored up. Romer went with
Goodling at mark-up; he won't change now.  Your message to him is:  don't
try to lead other Dems with you.

6. Bob Shireman, Janet and I will work the Hispanic groups and members
who come to WH for Monday's Hispanic Initiative event with VPOTUS.

7. Elena--one of us should call Wade Henderson, thank him for his support
at mark-up, and ask him to stick with us through the floor vote.  Let me
know whether you will call or would prefer me to.

8. Scott Fleming and his staff will be calling every Dem. we lost on the
floor last fall, and ask them to stick with us. He'll get back to us if
he needs us to help out.
