TEXT:
We now have a draft ruling from Treasury saying that workfare isn't
subject to FICA.  It defines workfare as payments coming from the welfare
office or its contractor, funded entirely by TANF and/or food stamps.
That's the good news.

The bad news is that (1) it's not out of Treasury/IRS yet, and (2) I am
nervous that DOL may be working against it (they have a copy). A guy at
Treasury who doesn't understand this issue politically just told me they
are considering a number of things that could water it down -- making it a
proposed ruling instead of final, or narrowing it in various ways,
including focusing more on training.  They have a big meeting with the IRS
general counsel tomorrow. We are depending a lot on Karl Scholz, who is
trying to do the right thing here, to shepherd it through.  I am trying to
reach Karl to see what's happening.
