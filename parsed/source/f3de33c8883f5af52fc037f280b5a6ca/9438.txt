PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON CANCER
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA
September 26, 1998

        Good morning. Cancer, as everyone knows, is the cruelest of
fates; and it strikes nearly every family.  It struck mine, and I lost my
mother to this devastating disease.  Stories like these are the reason why
thousands of Americans are coming together today, on the National Mall in
Washington, DC, with one, common purpose: to focus our nationD,s attention
on cancer. Gathering today are patients and survivors; families and
friends; doctors and Americans from all walks of life. The Vice
President, who has led our administrationD,s struggle against cancer, will
join their ranks, and will speak about the specific steps we are taking to
win that fight.

        This morning, I want to talk to you about our overall vision of
cancer care and research as we approach the 21st century.  This is a time
of striking progress, of stunning breakthroughs. With unyielding speed,
scientists are mapping the very blueprint of human life, and expectations
of the Human Genome Project are being exceeded by the day.  We are closing
in on the genetic causes of breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate
cancer. New tools for screening and diagnosis are returning to many
patients the promise of a long and healthy life.  It is no wonder the
scientists say we are turning the corner in the fight against cancer.

        For six   years now, my administration has made a top priority of
conquering this   terrible disease. We have helped cancer patients to keep
health coverage   when they change jobs. We have accelerated the approval
of cancer drugs   while maintaining safe standards. We have increased
,   "j




    funding for cancer research, and, as part of our balanced budget,
    strengthened Medicare to make the screening, prevention and detection of
    cancer more available and more affordable.

            Still, we know that we must never stop searching for the best
    means of prevention, the most accurate diagnostic tools, the most
    effective and humane treatments -- and, someday soon, a cure.  To that
    end, there are several steps we must take.

            First, to build on our remarkable progress, I have proposed an
    unprecedented mUlti-year increase in funding for cancer research. As
    studies proceed, we must remember that patients, as much as scientists,
    have a critical perspective to add to any research program. That is why,
    by next year, all federal cancer research programs will fully integrate
    patients and advocates into the process of setting research priorities.
    Next, as we continue to unravel the genetic secrets of cancer, we must
    apply that knowledge to the detection of this disease.   I am, therefore,
    issuing a challenge to the scientific community: to develop, by the year
    2000, new diagnostic techniques for every major kind of cancer. Also, we
    should give more patients access to cutting-edge clinical trials, so they
    -- and researchers -- can get faster results.   That is why I am directing
    the National Cancer Institute to speed development of a national clinical
    trials system -- a simple, accessible resource for health care providers
    and patients across the nation.  I have also asked Congress to pass my
    proposal to cover the costs of those trials for Medicare beneficiaries,
    who nee~ them most.

            New technological tools; new networks of information; new research
    priorities: all are part of our overall approach to health care that puts
    the patient first.  On this day, as Americans renew our national fight
    against cancer, we do well to remember that we are doing more than curing
    a disease.  We are curing the ills that disease may cause -- the stigmas,
    the myths, the barriers to quality care. The concerned citizens on the
    Mall today show that we are overcoming those barriers, one by one, and at
    the same time building a stronger and healthier America.

           Thank you for listening.
