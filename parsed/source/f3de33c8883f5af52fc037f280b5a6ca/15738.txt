Message Creation Date was at   4-JUN-1997 19:45:00

Shortly, you will receive a faxed copy of the draft OMB letter to the House
Human Resources Subcommittee that expresses the Administration's views on the
Chairman's mark of the "human resources" budget reconciliation language (see
LRM MDH86).  The Subcommittee may mark up language tomorrow.  For this reason,
comments are due to me by 9 am tomorrow morning (6/5/97).

If we do not receive comments from you by the deadline, we will assume that you
have no objection.  Thanks for your help.
