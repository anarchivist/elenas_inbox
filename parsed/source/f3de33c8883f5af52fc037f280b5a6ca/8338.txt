TEXT:
Tomorrow morning, a House Appropriations subcommittee will mark up and
approve a bill that will likely contain about $1.3 billion less for
education than was proposed in the President's budget (but about half a
billion increase over this fiscal year).  It will include funding cuts for
key initiatives like standards (Goals 2000) and teacher training and will
fail to fully fund the President's proposed increases for other
initiatives including educational technology, after-school, and safe and
drug-free schools.

In tomorrow morning's sr. staff mtg, Ann Lewis may raise the idea of the
President starting his Agriculture event tomorrow with criticism of this
bill and Congress' refusal to make adequate investments in education
generally, including school construction and class size.     I raised this
idea today with a number of staff at my level -- including one in Ann's
office who passed the idea along to her.   I wanted you to be aware of
this.  But timing may make this difficult ... because we don't yet have a
copy of the bill or key appropriation levels -- and we may not have them
in time for tomorrow morning's event.  If the President doesn't comment on
this at the event,  other options include releasing a written statement
tomorrow or waiting until the bill gets to the floor.
