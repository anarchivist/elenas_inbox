TEXT:
The State Dept called late last night about an issue in the
Foreign Ops Appropriations bill - relating to the reversal of the
Mexico City executive order re funding for intI family planning
orgs that provide abortion services with other money.    The
reversal of the Bush policy was one of the early EOs we signed.
The House (Chris Smith) included a provision in the bill
overturning the EO.  The Senate did not. The Senate actually has
statutory language that supports the EO. This difference could be
the single issue remaining in the conference.   State wanted
guidance as to how hard to push back on this - i.e., veto line or
no.
I spoke to Leg Affairs late last night and to State.  I understand


this came up at 7:30 and I raised it at 8:15. The instruction I
derived from Leon was that State should send a very strong signal
that we are committed to this policy. George told me after that
he thought maybe a meeting with you, Pat, him, Nancy Ann and me
might be a good idea - just 15 minutes to go over this.  I
personally would add people from the State Dept who know the
exact language at issue!
I have asked State exactly what the timing of this is. If it will
be moot by noon, then there's no need to meet. If this may drag
for a day or two, I will let you know.
Thanks.
