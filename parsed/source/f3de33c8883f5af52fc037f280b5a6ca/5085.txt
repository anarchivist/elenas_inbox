TEXT:
Elena and Jose - could you please let me know who the primary point of
contact at DPC is for economic opportunity issues? As you know, we had a
good introductory meeting with Mike Cohen and the education group last
week and we are looking forward to working with them in the future.  I
would also like to initiate that same process with the economic subgroup.
The Advisory Board will likely want to focus on economic issues for one or
two of its monthly meetings in the very near future. We would like to have
 a better understanding of the issues that DPC!NEe are already working on
to inform the Advisory Board meetings.

Please also continue to keep us in the loop as part of your weekly reports
so that we can also plug in better with the existing policy process.
Thanks much!
