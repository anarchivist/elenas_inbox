     Subject:         Meeting

      Loretta Ucelli and Doug Sosnik will begin holding regular, long term
      message meetings twice a week. These are not meetings on specific
      events. The first will be held tomorrow, Tuesday April 13 at 4:00 p.m. in
      the Roosevelt Room.  To be consistent, beginning Thursday, April 15, the
      meeting will be held every Monday and Thursday at 4:00 p.m. in the
      Roosevelt Room.

      If that presents problems, please let me know.

      Thank you.
