Esteemed Colleagues:

Attached is a draft one-pager for the proposed school safety event on
Thursday.  please note, Education has pulled back one of the studies, and
key event logistics have not been finalized yet.  Specifically ...

Paper/Overall Outline -- Elena, does this one pager accurately reflect
report and announcements? Do you still want to circulate this to others
before we nail down the rest of the event detail? See also existing
accomplishments doc from 12/97 that we will update for re-distribution.

Event Program -- Rahm, do we need a "real person" (principal) to speak?
Scheduling recommended that we find one; Education and I don't think we
need one and favor a shorter program w/just 'the AG (Riley and Deputy are
both out of town).

Audience    We still don't know which room we're doing this in.
Scheduling initially talked about Roosevelt Room, which would allow us
about 6 members, key staff and a handful of constituency types.   However,
there has been some talk of East Room.  I don't think we want to do
something this big -- do we?

Briefing -- Key Education staff are prepared to brief afterwards in the
press room.  I assume this is fine, and that we won't need extensive Q&A.

Remarks -- Education/Mike Cohen have two concerns    about the speech: (1)
that the crime stuff not be too inflamatory; and    (2) that key overall
education planks -- e.g., school construction        be mentioned.  Rahm, are
you fine with this -- what are you priorities for    the speech?

Finally, I've asked the folks from Education to attend the lOam crime
meeting tomorrow (Room 211), so that we can get these things finalized.
Jordan, if you haven't touched based with Rahm, you may want to visit


w/him -- as well as Education -- there.

Missing Christa,
Jose'

                                       Keeping Our Schools Safe and Drug-Free
                                                  March 19, 1998


            Announcement: Today, the President announced: (1) the findings of the first ever national
            estimate of crime and violence in U.S. schools; (2) the availability of $17.5 million in new
            funding from the President's 100,000 more police program for school safety; and (3) a series of
            recommendations by the Attorney General and Secretary of Education for an Annual Report on
            School Safety.

            "Violence and Discipline Problems in U.S. Schools: 1996-97". The National Center on
            Education Statistics released a national survey of principals from more than 1,200 public schools
            in the 50 states and Washington, D.C., on crime and violence in schools last year. Key findings
            of the survey include:

                   A Majority of schools -- or 57% -- reported crimes to law enforcement. This
                   includes an estimated 190,000 physical attacks or fights without a weapon, 116,000
                   incidents of thefts or larceny, and 98,000 incidents of vandalism.

                   Few schools -- only 10% -- reported serious violent crimes. This includes an
                   estimated 11,000 physical attacks or fights in which a weapon was used, 7,000 robberies,
                   and 4,000 rapes or other types of sexual assault.

                   Nearly half of all schools -- or 43% -- reported!!Q incidents of crime. And most
                   schools -- or 80% -- reported 5 or fewer crimes.

                   Schools with serious discipline problems were more likely to experience crime or
                   violence. Principals rate absenteeism, tardiness and fights as the 3 most common
                   discipline problems among students.

            Community Policing and School Safety. The Justice Department's COPS Office will make
            $17.5 million available for a new community policing program to address school safety. This
            initiative will fund partnerships between law enforcement, schools, and community groups to
            develop innovative approaches to reduce crime on or near school grounds.

            Annual Report on School Safety In his December 6, 1997 radio address, President Clinton
            called on the Attorney General and Secretary of Education to issue an annual report that
            principals, parents, and local officials could use to address their school crime problems. Today,
            Attorney General Reno and Secretary Riley presented the President with a framework for this
            report, which will be released at the beginning of every school year. This new report will
            include: an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an overview of state and local
            crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies that are successfully reducing school
            violence, drug use, and class disruption; actions that parents can take locally to combat school
            crime, including a local safety checklist; and resources available to schools and communities to
            help create safe, disciplined, and drug-free schools.
