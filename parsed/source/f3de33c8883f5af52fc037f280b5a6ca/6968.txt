TEXT:
Rob Mangus from Ford's office says they do not want the legislation to
allow for quota owners who also grow tobacco to be able to get the $8 buy
out plus be eligible for the transition assistance. However, we did a
conference call with Dallas Smith tonight who thinks that's what the
actual legislative language does. We will try and reach Senator Robb's
office over the weekend to see what their understanding of the language is.
