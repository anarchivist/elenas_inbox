TEXT:
Thank you all for all the hard work we put into this victory. This is the
first time in history that the Congress has voted to sustain civil rights
protections for gay and lesbian Americans.   The gay civil rights groups
and our friends and supporters in the gay community are elated and
enormously grateful to the President for his leadership.

Subject:         Statement by the President: Hefley Amendment

THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate
Release                                                         August 6, 1998

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

        I am gratified that the House has defeated an attempt to overturn my
Executive Order providing a uniform policy to prohibit discrimination
based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.

        This vote reflected the values of our nation. The American people
believe in fairness, not discrimination, and the Hefley amendment would
have legitimized government sponsored discrimination against its own
citizens based on their sexual orientation.

        It has always been the practice of this Administration to
prohibit employment discrimination in the federal civilian workforce based
on sexual orientation. Most federal agencies and departments have taken
actions to memorialize that policy.   The Executive Order does no more
than make that policy uniform across the federal government.  It does not
authorize affirmative action, or preferences, or special rights for anyone.

        The Executive Order reflects this AdministrationD,s firm
commitment that the federal government make employment related decisions
in the civilian workforce based on individual ability and not on sexual
orientation.
