o
-Viability Fetal Deformity:  Severe fetal deformities
are sometimes detected only after viability. Thus, abortions in
such cases would not be covered by any pre
o
-viability exception.
They might also not be covered under a "health" exception. While
there is no case law on the subject, we think doctors have
traditionally believed that fetal deformity abortions were
justified by maternal health -- given the Supreme Court's
expansive definition of the health exception that the
Constitution requires under Roe v. Wade.  But a health exception
in the Canady bill might not be similarly interpreted for two
reasons.  First, in its most recent abortion decision the Court
implied that it might now interpret the constitutional exception
for maternal health more narrowly. Second, because of the Canady
bill's criminal structure, doctors will almost certainly
interpret any health exception more narrowly, rather than risk
two years' imprisonment. This probably explains why
Congresswoman Schroeder's attempt to add a health exception to
the Canady bill expressly referred to "health (including any
threats thereto from severe fetal deformity)." It is unclear
whether such an exception would be consistent with your prior
positions. The Arkansas law that you signed contained an
exception for health but not expressly for fetal deformity. On
the other hand, that law was enacted prior to the Court's 1992
decision potentially narrowing "health." Moreover, you explained
your view that viability was important in terms of fetus' ability
to survive.
