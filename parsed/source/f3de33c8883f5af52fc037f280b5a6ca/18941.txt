TEXT:
Elena,
Yesterday afternoon, Maria convened a meeting with immigration advocates
and high tech industry to discuss the H1B issue.  Sally, Tom K., Ceci, and
Steve Warnath were also in attendance.
Industry was pushing for an increase in the H1B cap.  Sally and Maria
attempted to understand the precise nature of the shortages (to identify
the skill level needed to satisfy un-filled vacancies within the
industry).  However, industry was unable to break down their need for us.
Some professed a shortage of engineers (unspecified number), while others
spoke of IT jobs generally, which include programmers (no BA requirement) .
Industry was reluctant to discuss long-term solutions and H1B reforms
concurrent with our discussion of short-term solutions.  They reprented
that they have a desperate need now, and that they must have that.
addressed first.  Maria and Sally informed them that the best solution
would likely be one that attempted to satisfy both short and longer-term
issues.
It was suggested that the group get back together soon (later this week or
early next week) to discuss industry's resistance to the H1B reforms and
how short and long-term solutions to shortages could be addressed together.

Julie
