TEXT:
I am very concerned about the "fry" factor among DPC staff. Many of you
work ridiculous hours, all weekends, and do not take time for yourselves
to cool down. Well, you are about to be presented with an historic
opportunity. From approximately December 23rd until January 4, the
president, Bruce Reed, and Gene Sperling will all be on vacation.    That
hopefully means no events, little budget work, etc. There will not be an
opportunity like this until next August.   Therefore, I am asking all of
you to take ,some significant time off this holiday season in order to
preserve your mental sanity, physical health, and family ties.

This request is in my own interest.  If you take a vacation, then you
won't burn out and quit.  In addition, you will come back hopefully
recharged.

Please go away.  Take a week off at a minimum. Don't force me to have to
lock you out of the office over the holiday break.
