TEXT:
I just faxed you the final draft "litigation letter" and
accompanying principles for the Headwaters discussions. Both have
been vetted through DOJ and DOl.    I would appreciate your final
review for clearance ... if possible, DOl would like to send it to
Hurwitz's attorneys today.
Thanks again for your help.
