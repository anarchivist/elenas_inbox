Subject:         FYI: INS Restructuring Legislation/Naturalization Funding

FYI:   Attached is a wrap-up of INS-related issues --

Restructuring Legislation:  INS is still redrafting its restructuring
legislative package. They plan to incorporate OMB's suggested.expansion
of the restructuring section in this revised draft.  The draft is with the
Commissioner and INS has told me it plans to submit a redrafted bill to
the Department on Monday, June 22.

Hill Action: As a follow-up to Julie Fernandes' note, Lamar Smith's
Immigration Subcommittee will not markup the Rogers-Reyes restructuring
bill on Tuesday as expected. Apparently Chairman Hyde told Rogers that he
was not using the Judiciary Committee to further the ends of the
appropriators. As a result, the mark-up is off -- which may weaken Rogers
resolve/ability to include an INS restructuring proposal in the CJS
appropriations bill -- but I wouldn't bet on it.

Michael, you may want to raise the INS restructuring issue with the AG and
Director on Tuesday to determine whether the Department and OMB will
support a veto threat if restructuring along the lines of Reyes (two
bureau withiri Justice) is included in CJS.

Naturalization:   INS is still talking about some type of budget amendment
to supplement FY 1999 for naturalization.   They wanted to call Maria
again.  I told them not to -- that the WH would contact them about a
follow-up meeting.   I also said that from the DPC/OMB perspective INS must
justify its current use of resources and outline a coherent backlog


reduction plan prior to any discussion of additional resources.   I also
told INS and the Department that they should not be floating any funding
proposals to the WH that did not clear/having the blessing of the
Department.  I understand that Colgate told INS that seeking a
supplemental appropriation at this time was "nuts."

 Please contact Julie or I if we can answer any further questions.                     Thanks.
