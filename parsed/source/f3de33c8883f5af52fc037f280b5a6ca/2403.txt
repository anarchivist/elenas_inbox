TEXT:
The Vice President spoke to Dr. Kessler today and reported that Dr.

Kessler wants the White House to issue a statement encouraging the Senate

to keep working on the McCain bill and to pass it (even if it has flaws)

and keep the ball moving.    He said he felt like we needed to keep the

momentum moving.    The VP said he thought that was a good idea and would

push for it.
