      TEXT:
      I don't presume to be a speechwriter or policy advisor - but I do have
      some strong instincts about what will work for the Governors Roundtable
      remarks. Thus,  I would like to layout a suggested construct for the
      Presidents remarks for you to adopt, consider, edit, or reject as you wish.


      I. Opening
              1. former colleagues - 16th (?) NGA mtg I have attended etc.
              2. Memory of Gov. Chiles - whose civility left a mark on all of
      us ...


      II. Six Years of a Successful partnership - Effective federalism.
              1. As a former Governor, I understand the f~deral/state role.
              2. Our record demonstrates this:
                      Unfunded Mandates Bill
                      COPs program
                      CHIP program
                      Welfare reform

                 3. Last year we met in this room and you presented the following
      goals:
                       Transportation Finance - Govs Schafer and Patton made this
      case for you and working together we passed it - all 27 billion.
                       Internet taxation (Gov Leavitt and Romer made this case
      and we worked together to get this passed)
                       Workforce development Act - Gov Ridge (?) presented this
      and I signed it.
                       Regulatory Reform - Gov ? presented this and I signed
      Thompson-Levin

              4. Through the year we worked on other issues successfully
      together:


                FICA Ruling - Treasury has opined that states are not
required to pay FICA for workfare - major cost savings to states.
                Cost Allocation - Congress required us in the Ag Research
Bill to allocate your costs, and after hearing clearly from you we
accepted your state-by-state methodology for doing so.
                EPA Air regs- We were required to issue new standards but
- after hearing from you - the states were given significant tools of
flexibility.

        Each of these issues presented federalism issues and we respected
the states role.


III. Our Budget is a Win for States

         Prior to the release of our budget we met with you and you
expressed two priorities, (1) don't cut existing commitments, and (2)
invest in kids.
                Our budget does that - and more - for the states

                a.    fully funds SSBG
                b.    no Medicaid cuts
                c.    Head Start increase
                d.    COPs increase
                e.    Welfare increase - emphasis on fatherhood per your lead
                f.    School Modernization initiative
                g.    Class size initiative
                h.    Livability initiative

                These budget commitments reflect both the importance of
the level of funding , but are consistent with our effective federalism -
they give you the tools and flexibility to do your job (livability,
welfare, SSBG).


IV. Looking Ahead: Preparation for the 21st Century Economy

         As we look ahead, using this partnership - this effective
federalism - that has worked to tackle welfare, children's health etc. how
to we prepare our workforce for the 21st Century economy. Theme of
partnership - accountability and flexibility. Two components: (1)
Workforce training, and (2) Education Accountability

        Workforce Training - describe our initiative

        Education Accountability IFlexibility
                a. We have learned from the states: examples. Ridge,
Hunt, etc.                              b. We can't have any failing
schools...  federal role to assure that
                c. We won't tell you how to do it - only that you find a
way to do it - and we will give you the flexibility to do that:
                        ED-Flex - break out of reauthorization
                        Teacher Block Grant

V. Additional tools of flexibility - NPR initiative (Oregon plan)
