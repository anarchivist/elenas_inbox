Education asked if we still wanted to hold this (they want to get the

        TEXT:
        We recently learned that as part of the effort to identify discretionary
        offsets, OMB proposed a user fee on employers for each application they
        submit for the WTW or WOTC tax credit.   This is supposed to generate $20
        million to offset DOL's adminstrative costs.   The amount of the user fee
        has not been specified but is likely to be around $75 per application
         (derived by dividing $20 M by the latest certification estimates). The
        way the system now work is: employers send forms into state Employment
        Security agencies to certify whether an individual meets the eligibility
        requirements (for example, to determine whether someone is a long-term
        welfare recipient).   DOL funds the state agencies to do this work, though
        there is not a direct relationship between the number of applications a
        state processes and the administrative funding they receive. Apparently
        some states (including OH and TX) are doing a poor job of processing the
        applications and employers have expressed lots of concern to DOL    (this is
        a separate issue which probably needs to be looked at regardless of the
        user fees) .   The employer then gets to claim a tax credit for each
        individual certified.

        OMB says Orszag knew about this, but none of us at DPC had any idea until
        we read about it in the published budget.  In fact, we included the tax
        credits as part of our package of welfare reform accomplishments and
        included the extension of credits in our list of FY 2000 welfare to'work
        initiatives that we've been sharing with the world without knowing about
        the user fee proposal.   Did either of you happen to know?

        It's rather awkward that at the same time the President and VP are
        praising businesses for their involvement in welfare to work and
        encouraging them to do more, our budget is proposing a user fee on the tax
        credits that are supposed to encourage them to get involved.

        DOL has now developed legislative language at OMB's direction, which is
        going through the clearance process to be included in our package of
        discretionary offsets which will be transmitted to the Hill.  DOL has met
        with employers and states.  Not surprisingly, employers are strongly
        opposed.  There are serious concerns about how this affects small business
        and the current draft language would allow DOL to establish a lower fee
"


     for small businesses.  SBA just learned about the proposal and is
     obviously concerned (especially since they've been reaching out
     aggressively to small businesses to get them involved in welfare to work
     and marketing the tax credit as an incentive). I don't know if Eli knows
     yet, but I assume he'd raise concerns since the partnership is also
     aggressively marketing the tax credits (through 800 #s etc).  Cheri Carter
     also expressed some concern about·this today.

      We met with OMB today and they've tried to put their best arguments
     forward, but it really comes down to needing an offset. At a staff level,
     they don't think this has any chance of going anywhere on the Hill. The
     question is whether it's worth $20 million in offsets to continue to
     advance a proposal which flies in the face of the President's message to
     get business involved in welfare to work. It sounds like there might be
     an option to not include it in our package of discretionary offsets if
     there were strong policy objections (though this would probably require a
     strong signal from you to OMB).  You may also want to check with Martha
     Foley about how she thinks this plays on the Hill.
