TEXT:
The WTW law provides $100 M to be awarded in FY 2000 for "successful
performance" states and directs DOL, in consultation with HHS, NGA, and
APWA, to develop a formula for measuring success within one year of
enactment   (by 8/5/98). While PRWORA simply said the HPB should recognize
performance against the goals of the law, the BBA provided more guidance
on what should be measured for the WTW bonus: 1) job placement, 2)
duration of placement, 3) increase in earnings, 4) anything else Secretary
deems appropriate.    DOL has convened a work group over the past several
months to develop a proposed formula and has shared some draft proposals.
EOP staff is meeting tomorrow to make sure we're all on the same page
about the recommendations, and on Thursday OMB is bringing HHS and DOL in
for a joint meeting.    DOL is supposed to be preparing a comparison of the
TANF and proposed WTW bonus.   In the meantime, we want to get your general
reaction to a few issues before we go too much farther.

Background
 TANF has 4 measures, with the following weights:
Job Entry Rate 40%
Success in the Work Force 25% (combination of retention and earnings gain)
Increase in Job Entry Rate 20%
Increase in Success in the Work Force 15%
NOTE: this is just the interim formula for FY 99 -- HHS will publish a
rule for future years.

The proposed approach for WTW includes 4 measures:
1. Job Entry Rate ( movement from not employed to any unsubsidized
employment) 35%
2. "Substantial Job Entry Rate" (movement from not employed or
"underemployed" to unsubsidized employment over 20 hours/week)  20%
3, Job Retention  (over 6 months)  30%
4. Earnings Gain (over 6 months) 15%
NOTE: no improvement measures--in part because WTW bonuses are a one-time
deal.

Issues
1. To what extent should TANF and WTW HPB be the same? The WTW statute
generally follows the interim TANF measures, but should they be
identical? What about measuring same basic accomplishments (i.e. job
entry), but defining differently? I know Barry White is pushing hard to
·.    . I

       '.
     make them as close as possible.

     2. Weighting: the initial proposal from WTW work group is above.  However,
     several states (incl CA and IL) have expressed interest in shifting weight
     toward retention and earnings gain (e.g. 15% job entry, 20% substantial
     job entry, 50% retention, 15% earnings gain).  Their arguments include:
     job entry gets tougher as you get to harder cases and states that have
     been at this longer will be penalized, and WTW is about not just getting a
     job but keeping it and moving up.  Counter arguments include: just getting
     a job for the hard-to-place is worth rewarding, and data for retention and
     earnings gain is less standard/more questionable. Apparently there have
     been strong and divergent views on this within the group. The latest
     thought is to publish several options in the federal register and get
     reactions.  Do you have strong feelings on the general weights, or the
     idea of publishing options??

     3. Date Source: for FY 99 TANF HPB, states have flexibility on data
     source (recognizing that not all can access UI wage records and there are
     limitations with them).  DOL is uncomfortable with this approach, as are
     some of the workgroup members and there is more interest in either
     requiring a consistent data source (though none is readily apparent), or
     at least having states that use a similar data source compete against each
     other, so all those using UI would be in one pot, those using admin data
     another pot·etc.

     4. Distribution of funds: the WTW work group has not spent enough time
     grappling with how funds would be distributed among the high performing
     states, i.e. should there be a cap, what are the thresholds to qualify,
     how many winners etc. We only have seen a very rough proposal so far.
     There is some interest in publishing several options on these issues in
     the federal register as well.
