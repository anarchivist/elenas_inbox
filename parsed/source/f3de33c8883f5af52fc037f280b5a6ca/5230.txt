TEXT:
Mike and I had a productive conversation; a brief summary is below. We
agreed that we need to have another meeting soon, involving the two of
you, the two of us,  and leg. affairs staff from WH and ED. The purpose
would be to review and further develop the basic strategy, especially with
regard to NAEP reauthorization.

Cohen/Smith
Next Steps on National Tests

1.    Declare victory in the next few days
     Bill Signing on Wednesday Or Thursday

 Calls from Reed/Cohen/Smith on day of signing ceremony to national
political and education press,to explain victory

 Riley letter to States/Districts that have signed up, describing where we
are

2. Get NAGB right, and in charge, quickly
 Invite NAGB chair to bill signing, and meet with him afterwards to talk
about how he moves forward quickly
 Add Engler and either Diane Ravitch or E.D. Hirsch to NAGB before its
Nov. 21 meeting. (Engler is easy; Ravitch or Hirsch can be added only if.
we drop someone else; Smith will talk through options with Riley)
 Try for 11/21 event with POTUS when NAGB is in town--to officially put
them in charge

3. Keep states/cities on board
 keep them as close as possible to test development process
 involve them in strategy for moving forward

4. Figure out NAEP 'reauthorization strategy
 Administration reauthorization proposal, including testing authority,
ready to go by January
 Develop legislative strategy, including consultations with Dem.
Supporters, Caucuses, moderate RO,s

5. Keep ACHIEVE helpful or neutralized
 Keep Romer from wandering off the reservation
 Work with ACHIEVE staff to keep their next move supportive with
D&multitestD8 approach
 DonD,t let the word D&harmonizeD8 become part of their vocabulary as it
has ours.
