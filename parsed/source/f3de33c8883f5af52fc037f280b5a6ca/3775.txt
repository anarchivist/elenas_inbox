MEMORANDUM FOR:                BRUCE REED
                               ELENA KAGAN

FROM:                          MIKE COHEN

SUBJECT:                       PROCESS FOR RESOLVING HISPANIC CAUCUS
                               CONCERNS ON NATIONAL TESTING INITIATIVE


It is critical that we have a final Administration position on the concerns raised by the Hispanic
Caucus by the beginning of September, when Congress returns. Earlier would be preferable,
though difficult. Below are my recommendations for how to proceed:

1. Education Department produces options memo
I have asked Secretary Riley to develop an options memo which can form the basis of a decision
memo to the President.
·       preliminary draft by August 8
·       feedback from DPC, OPL, Leg affairs by August 11
·       final by August l3


2. Internal White House review
I think we should plan on two internal meetings, including DPC, NEC, OPL, Leg. Affairs,
Political Affairs, Intergovernmental, Communications, etc.
August 18:      review and discussion of ED options, and assignments for external consultations
August 22:      review feedback from outside groups, determine views of key offices, and agree
                on basic themes for decision memo

3. Consultations during week of 18th
-- Hispanic Caucus
-- Hispanic groups
-- urban districts
-- other supporters (e.g., business groups, AFT, NEA,)
-- states that have signed up or are likely to
-- key governors (e.g., Romer)

4. DPC Decision Memo to POTUS
By August 25, we should send a decision memo to porus that presents all options for which
there is significant support, and which lays out pro's and con's, including education impact,
likely impact on overall testing initiative, likely impact on race initiative, and other political
considerations.
