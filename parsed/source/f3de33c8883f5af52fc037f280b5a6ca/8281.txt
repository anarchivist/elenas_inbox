 have the time/energy --Gene is going to talk with Cynthia Rice and Chuck
Marr on tobacco tomorrow at 11:30-12:30.  He would love to have you either
stop by or join by phone if you want to.  the phone number here is
456-2807.  Thanks Elena.

p.s. he has a china prep meeting (w/Berger/Rubin/and Albright) at 12:30pm
so his time really is limited, if that helps any.
