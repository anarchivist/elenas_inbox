Medicare. We have almost finished outlining the Medicare compromise. It will not include
raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67, the income-related premium, the $5 Medicare
copayment, or malpractice provisions. On Friday, we resolved our last major political obstacle
on Medicare by reaching an agreement which ensures new private fee-for-service options have
adequate balanced billing protections. The agreement does include a compromise on the
Medicare Commission. It would include 17 members (eight Democrats, eight Republicans, and
the Chair, which would be jointly selected by you and the Leadership). The Commission will
release a report in 1999 and require a two-thirds majority to pass out the recommendations.

With regard to Medical Savings Accounts it appears that the final resolution will have to include
a compromise on the size of the Medicare demonstration somewhere between the Senate-passed
100,000 and 500,000. The one other outstanding issue is that the Senate firmly believes that we
should not pay for Medicare manunography copayments since they argue that most women
would already have these services paid for by Medigap. However, if we have to compromise on
an MSA demonstration that is more than 250,000 beneficiaries, winning on this issue could help
appease our liberal base. This issue has also always been an important priority for the First
Lady.

Children's Health.      The children's advocacy community and our traditional Democrats were
thrilled with your remarks on children's health at the immunization event on Wednesday. They
were extremely pleased that you are supporting an increase in the children's investment from
additional revenue from a proposed tobacco tax. They are also thankful for your leadership in
insisting on a meaningful benefits package -- including prescription drugs, mental health,
vision, and hearing services -- and that you are working to ensure that these dollars will work to
supplement rather than supplant existing public and private funding.

As of Friday evening, the budget negotiators still had not resolved the children's health issue.
The two major outstanding questions are on the benefits package and the overall level of funding.
 The benefits discussion is focused on how much flexibility states will have in designing a
benefits package and specifically whether states should be allowed to design a benefits package
financially equivalent to the FEHBP benefit package (actuarial equivalence) that does not
necessarily include the full range of services that many believe are essential to make up a
meaningful benefits package. For example, the conference agreement allowed states to develop
a package with no prescription drugs, vision, hearing, or mental health services. It does,
however, require some benefits including hospital and physician services.

The FEHBP actuarial equivalence proposal is currently one of four options that states could use
for design their benefits package in addition to an FEHBP option, a state employee plan option,
and an option to allow states to use the benefits package of a state's most popular HMO. It is
important to note that we have already agreed to give much greater flexibility than was in the
Senate package. In addition to accepting at least three of their four proposed options, we also
have agreed to let states which already have a children's plan with a full range of benefits
(Florida, Pennsylvania, and New York) grandfather in their benefits package (provided they
include prescription drugs, vision, hearing, and mental health services and subject to Secretarial
approval). We have also agreed to a higher Federal matching rate than under Medicaid and have
r.
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


     agreed not to require states to cover EPSDT -- which was the major objection of the states. So
     far, Republicans have not accepted our counter offer to have certain stipulations associated with
     the FEHBP actuarial equivalent option, including covering prescription drugs, vision, hearing,
     and mental health services.

     The amount of revenue from a tobacco tax that will be allocated to this investment has yet to be
     determined and will probably get decided at the very end of the process. We anticipate that we
     will be able to get some increase over the $16 billion investment, although we will probably not
     be able to get the entire $24 billion.

     Medicaid. There are a limited number of outstanding Medicaid issues other than the allocation
     of disproportionate share hospital (DSH) cuts and the investment in DC and in the territories.
     The DSH issue is purely a political fight about the geographical formula. The conference has
     developed a formula that would cause high DSH states extreme pain. Congressman Spratt
     (South Carolina is a high DSH state) is working with us to develop a formula that would ensure
     that no state has to accept extreme cuts. We have yet to reach any agreement in this area. Right
     now it looks as though DC and the territories may be taken care of outside of the context of
     Medicaid. Finally, we did resolve the issue surrounding low-income protections by agreeing to
     accept the House-passed formula which covers the full premium for low-income beneficiaries up
     to 135 percent of poverty. The only difference is that this provision is capped mandatory
     spending rather than an open-ended entitlement. Although some of our Democrats won't like
     this, it is far better than the Senate proposal to block grant this proposal. Ironically, Domenici
     and other Republicans feel as though they completely caved on this issue and gave us a full
     victory.
