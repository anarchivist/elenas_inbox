TEXT:
As I mentioned, I wasn't in team leaders and don't think any of the ago
riders are particularly objectionable to DPC.   I talked to USDA and
included their feelings on two rider issues, they didn't care about the
others.

FNS funds -- The conference provides that a small portion of research on
nutrition programs be conducted by the FNS, hwever, the bulk of that
research would be provided by the Economic Research Service. USDA would
urge Congress to allow all research to be conducted by FNS.

USDA rural development -- The conference report blocks use of mandatory
funding under Fund for Rural America. We urge the conference to remove
this provision.

Country of Origin -- this is currently going to be a study, I put in a
call to NEC but because of relations with Canada, I don't think we had
agreement to push this.
