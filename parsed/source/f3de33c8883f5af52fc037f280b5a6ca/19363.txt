TEXT:
Our office would like to thank you for making yesterday's Equal Pay
announcement possible. We have gotten incredibly positive feedback from
our groups and our message has travelled far and wide via press and
grassroots activities in 650 cities. We've come a long way on this issue
and certainly achieved our goal of "more than just a proclamation"!


We have plans to celebrate and we'd like you to join us.  We'll let you
know where and when.  Thanks again for making EQUAL PAY DAY count for
working women across America!
