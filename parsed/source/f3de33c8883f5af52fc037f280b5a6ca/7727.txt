States work on separate

                                          U.S. out of deal

News

                                          WASHINGTON - The attorneys general of
41
                                           states who have sued the tobacco
companies have
                                          a message for Congress: Pass
comprehensive
                                          anti-smoking legislation this summer
or the states
                                          could take the issue - and hundreds of
billions of
                                          dollars - away from the federal
government.

                                          Lawyers representing the states and
the cigarette
                                          makers have secretly discussed an
alternative
                                          settlement plan that resembles a
scaled-back
                                          version of the $368.5 billion deal the
two sides
                                          reached last June, according to
lawyers involved in
                                          the negotiations. The proposed
settlement would
                                          become effective if Congress fails to
enact
                                          anti-tobacco legislation this year.

                                          Unlike the proposal pending in
Congress, however,


                       the settlement being discussed would
send all the
                       money paid by the tobacco companies to
the states
                       and none of it to the federal
government, the
                       lawyers said.

                       State officials said they still prefer
the
                       comprehensive national legislation
being debated
                       this week in the Senate because it
would grant
                       regulatory authority over tobacco
products to the
                       Food and Drug Administration and
possibly lead to
                       the development of safer cigarettes -
something a
                       settlement of the state lawsuits could
never do.

                       However, Mississippi Attorney General
Mike
                       Moore said the new settlement talks,
which began
                       in early April, are needed to give
states that have
                       sued the tobacco industry a fallback
position if
                       national legislation fails. Mr. Moore
and others said
                       the alternative plan also puts
pressure on Congress
                       to pass comprehensive anti-smoking
proposals
                       now or face being having federal
legislation be
                       made irrelevant by the states.

                       "The states, through our lawsuits and
settlement,
                       brought this opportunity to Congress
to enact a
                       national tobacco policy that would
reduce
                       underaged smoking and lead to greater
control of
                       the tobacco industry," Mr. Moore said.
"When
                       things began looking so bleak a few
weeks ago, we
                       decided we needed to have a plan B in
case plan
                       A blows up."

                       Under one proposal being considered,
the states
                       would voluntarily dismiss their claims


that the
                    industry owes them billions of dollars
in
                    reimbursement of Medicaid money spent
on
                    smoking-related illnesses. Then the
companies
                    would agree to settle the remaining
fraud and
                    deceptive trade practice issues in the
lawsuits,
                    according to lawyers involved in the
discussions.

                    Because states receive large portions
of their
                    Medicaid funds from the federal
government, they
                    would be required to share much of
their settlement
                    money with officials in Washington. If
the Medicaid
                    claims are dismissed, however, the
states would get
                    to keep all the money, attorneys said.

                    "I'm not sure if that is a viable
proposal or just
                    meant to be a threat to Congress to
pay something
                    now or risk losing the money," said
Gary Black, an
                    analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.

                    The new talks could put pressure on
some public
                    health advocates who are fighting the
current
                    anti-smoking proposals before Congress
in hopes
                    of winning a tougher bill next year,
said Richard
                    Scruggs, a Mississippi lawyer involved
in the talks.

                    "The state lawsuits are the bigger
hammer here.
                    Without them, Congress wouldn't even be
                    considering tobacco legislation," Mr.
Moore
                    added.   "There is no next year for
this. If Congress
                    doesn't pass comprehensive legislation
this year,
                    the states will act on our own and
then Congress
                    will lose interest next year."

                    No matter what the motivation, the
possibility of a


                     separate deal between the states and
the industry
                     certainly complicates an already
confusing debate
                     over how to resolve the tobacco
controversy.

                     Last June, states that had sued the
industry for
                     reimbursement of smoking-related
health-care
                     costs joined with trial lawyers and
many
                     health-care advocates in negotiating a
historic
                     agreement with the cigarette makers.

                     The deal required the industry to pay
$368.5 billion
                     over 25 years, end nearly all forms of
tobacco
                     advertising, submit to FDA regulatory
control and
                     reduce teenage smoking. In return, the
tobacco
                     companies would have received
unprecedented
                     protections from lawsuits.

                     The settlement, however, had one
catch: It needed
                     approval from Congress. In the eight
months that
                     followed, the proposal took a beating
from some
                     public health activists who said it
was too soft on
                     the industry and from some Republicans
who
                     labeled it as a big government, big
taxation
                     program.

                     Meanwhile, four of the state lawsuits
- Mississippi,
                     Florida, Texas and Minnesota - came
due for trial.
                     The industry settled those cases
individually for
                     more than $36 billion combined.
Lawyers said it is
                     unclear how the agreements in those
states would
                     be affected by either congressional
legislation or by
                     a possible settlement with the
remaining states.

                     "There are three more state cases set
for trial later


                        this year and more than a dozen on the
calendar for
                        next year, and if national legislation
doesn't pass,
                        we need to have an alternative plan,"
said Joe Rice,
                        a South Carolina lawyer whose firm
represents
                        more than 30 states, including Texas.

                        "The tobacco boys have told us the
global
                        settlement is not viable, and they
wanted to discuss
                        alternatives," Mr; Rice said. "So we
are doing that."

                        While last year's agreement would have
ended the
                        41 state cases and the class-action
lawsuits
                        pending against the companies, the
current
                        discussions deal only with the actions
brought by
                        the attorneys general.

                        Mr. Rice said the industry is much
more worried
                        about the state lawsuits than the
other legal
                        challenges it is facing.

                        "They are confident they will win the
class-action
                        and individual cases, but the Medicaid
lawsuits
                        have them and wall Street extremely
nervous," he
                        said.

                        That's because each of the state cases
are
                        "bet-the-company lawsuits," said Steve
Parrish,
                        executive vice president of Philip
Morris Inc., the
                        nation's largest cigarette
manufacturer. He said
                        tobacco officials are looking at a
possible deal with
                        the remaining state attorneys general,
but "'we
                        haven't made a determination on how
much that
                        makes sense."

                        According to five lawyers involved in
the
                        discussions, early proposals included:



                        The tobacco companies paying the
states
                       between $200 billion and $240 billion
over the next
                       25 years.

                        The cigarette makers agreeing to
extensive
                       advertising and marketing restrictions.

                        The tobacco industry funding
counteradvertising
                       campaigns to discourage teens from
smoking.

                        A permanent injunction prohibiting
the companies
                       from targeting children and granting
state attorneys
                       general the authority to police such
activity.

                       The industry is willing to pay
considerably more
                       money to states that pass laws
granting the tobacco
                       companies various civil liability
protections, the
                       attorneys said.

                       "States that give the tobacco
companies immunity
                       through legislation would be able to
get more
                       money or other concessions from a
separate fund,"
                       said a plaintiffs' lawyer involved in
the talks.

                       Specifically, the cigarette makers
want other states
                       to impose laws similar to the statute
passed in
                       Texas in 1993 that basically prohibits
an individual
                       from suing the industry if the person
knew smoking
                       was dangerous.
