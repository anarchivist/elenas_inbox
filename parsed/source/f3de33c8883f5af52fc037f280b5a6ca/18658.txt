TEXT:
HHS has asked for our assistance in preparing answers for two questions
Varmus may get a the House Commerce hearing tomorrow.

1. Why does the Administration's bill call for civil and not criminal
penalties?

Bill - could you take a crack at this and e:mail me a response?

2.  How does the Administration reconcile allowing the creation of embryos
for research purposes in the private sector, but not using Federal funds?

One option for answering this question could be the following:

The Administration bill does not address the issue of embryo research.    It
prohibits the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human


being. We will not resolve the debate over embryo research in the
immediate future, but we do want to move to ensure that cloning technology
is not use prematurely to create a child.

However, there are scientific applications of somatic cell nuclear
transfer that are worth pursuing, as described in Dr. Varmus' testimony.
Depending on one's definition of an embryo, some may feel that this
research would, indeed, entail the creation of embryos.

We do not have a consensus in this country on whether or not it is
acceptable to create embryos for research purposes. Therefore, in 1994,
the President issued a statement directing the National Institutes of
Health not to fund research involving the creation of human embryos.
However, the government does not have a compelling reason to prohibit such
activities if they are done using private funds.   Therefore, if a couple
wants to pursue a novel method for treating their infertility problems,
and has the means to do so, they are free to pay for such services in a
private clinic[, subject to appropriate FDA regulation).
This is similar to the way we treat alcohol.   Many people have a strong
belief that alcohol consumption is forbidden.   Those people do not buy
alcohol and, out of respect for that belief, we do not use taxpayers'
dollars for the purchase of alcohol.   However, the beliefs of some are not
cause for the government to issue a broad prohibition against the sale and
consumption of alcohol by others. We do not restrict liberty without a
strong compelling reason to do so.    It appears that we do have a
consensus against using cloning technology to create human beings and our
proposed ban supports that sentiment.



The SAP speaks in support of stem cell research which might be interpreted
to include creating embryos for research purposes. Also, the Bond bill
does not distinguish between public and private activities. Therefore, we
might ask Harold Varmus to clarify by saying that the SAP does not trump
the 1994 statement and that the ban on using Federal funds to create
embryos still stands.
