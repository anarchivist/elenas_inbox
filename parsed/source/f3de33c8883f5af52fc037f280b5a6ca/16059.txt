TEXT:
As Bruce might have told you, in the scheduling meeting we had with
Erskine on Friday, we discussed the possibility of doing a message event
the week of July 21 on the Supreme Court's decision on the RFRA.  (This
event would be instead of a radio address on July 5).

Do you want the DPC to be the staff contact for this proposed event, or do
you want Public Liasion to take the lead? I figured you would probably
want it -- but know that DPC has got an awful lot going on right now.

Please let me know how you want to proceed on this.

Thanks.
