TEXT:
1.      ONDCP is saying they will do the Drug Strategy Release on the
10th w/out POTUS. We had told them POTUS wanted to announce it in the
Radio Address on the 7th -- and they claimed it wouldn't be ready. The
President is addressing the House Democratic Caucus Issues Conf. in
Wintergreen that day (I think) so perhaps it's fine to have McCaffrey do
the release here and POTUS announce it on the road.  No matter what we
need a Presidential event releasing the Strategy I think -- since the
President's done an event every other year.

2.      Bad news with the FOP. They're terribly upset there hasn't been
an answer. Gil still feels he is owed a call from Erskine - since he
called him and left a message for him to call back. Also, while the local
FOP is supposedly putting out a statement supporting agents not
testifying, the National/Gil refuse to allow any supportive statements on
anything. Gil has decided to push for legislation to be introduced by
Feb. 10 requiring collective bargaining for all federal law enforcement
apparently they have a commitment from several members to introduce it.
They have at least 200 members coming to D.C. Feb. 10 to lobby for this.
They will get a ton of press attention if they mention a disagreement with
the White House on this issue, so I would like to find a way to cool them
down a bit.  I realize this may not be a good time to resolve this issue
-- but a temporary relief would be to get Erskine to call. I look to you
all for an update on how much we can do after that.
