     Subject:         Latino turnout in Califorinia/Prop. 227

     I   talked to Frankilin, who clarified the figures in his email.

     Latino Turn Out: made up 12% of all California voters, double the number
     of Latinos who voted in the 1994 primary.

     Latino Voters on Proposition 227:
",

     yes:  37%
     no:  63%

     All Voters on proposition 227:

     yes:  61%
     no:  39%

     This is consistent with the other LA times article that reported, "Latino
     voters opposed Prop. 227 by a margin of 2 to 1, but in passed in an almost
     mirror image of that vote."
