      We have made some.changes to the brown bag lunch schedule.  Please make
      sure you give your interns the new schedule.     Paul wants the interns to
      know, that the lunches are mandatory, since staff is taking time out to
      meet with them.  If the interns know they won't be able to attend they can
      call Essence at ext. 6-7732.

      I have set up a schedule of brown bag lunches, for the interns.    I would
      like to thank all of our Special Assistants for finding time in their busy
      schedules, to arrange a meeting with DPC's interns. We would like the
      interns to come to Paul's office in room 214, at 11:45 a.m. on the dates
      listed below. At noon, in room 211, the interns will then meet with the
      Special Assistant scheduled to speak on that day.    Let's all please try to
      keep these corrunitments, as our interns last day will be, July 3rd.
