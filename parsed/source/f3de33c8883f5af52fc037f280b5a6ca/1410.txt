I can make it.  I also think we should consider a pre-meeting, including
the ED people, 15-30 minutes before the meeting.  It would be good if we
could go into this meeting with some idea of what civil rights groups are
likely to say. We should also not presume that everyone from the
Administration will automatically speak with one voice. A quick rehersal
will help.

DOJ does not want the President to do anything around the signing of the
victims legislation, as Elena suspected.  Rahm is talking to the Counsel's
office about what, if anything, could be released in a written statement
by the President when he signs the bill.
