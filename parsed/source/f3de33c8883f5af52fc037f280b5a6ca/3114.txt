       Hope this is the correct e-mail. Instead of telephone tag.

       1. I expect to be in DC on Wednesday and Thursday, but don't have much room
       on Thursday because of commitments with Urban League. I'm worried about
       getting started, and don't want to trip over you. I think there are a
       number of discrete things that agencies (including CEA) can and should get
       moving on -- and I'm eager to get that rolling because it will take quite
       some time for those efforts to bear fruit.

       2. I'd really like to have a good chunk of time to brainstorm on the policy
       research/development workplan with some group of people on Wednesday, at a
       time other than 3-5. Doesn't have to be an exhaustive group; happy to go
       through it twice if everyone who ought to be involved can't make one
       meeting; happy to do it with Jose or someone else on your staff if you
       can't participate.

       3. I've heard a little from Leslie Thornton about a draft "directive"
       concerning civil rights enforcement/investigation in California and Texas.
       Sounds like it was watered down to something like "Riley and Reno will work
       with the Advisory Board" -- which, if correct, is worse than nothing.
       Truly. I spoke with Dellinger last week, and he agrees that there's every
       reason to give OCR and DOJ muscular instructions. I'd like to discuss this
       with you at your earliest convenience, and get a better feel for what the
       objections are to being a little bolder, as you and I first discussed.

       4. Haven't heard anything about the content of the July 14th speech. Minyon
       told be tentative decision on venue, which she and I agree is a big
