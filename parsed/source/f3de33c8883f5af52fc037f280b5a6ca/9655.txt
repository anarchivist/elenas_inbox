-TEXT:
Congo Berman's staff, confirmed by Mollahan's staff, passed on a rumor
 that House and Senate CJS Chairmen Rogers and Gregg may have reached a
 compromise on INS restructuring which may then be included in the CJS
 conference bill. We have heard that no Dems were involved in the
discussions and that Senator Abraham may have signed off on the deal.   INS
 said that Gregg's staff said no final deal has been reached but that
Rogers is dealing hard to get this in -- and that it still may be stopped
but only at the highest levels.

While at this point we have no specificity on what this compromise
restructuring looks like, Berman's staff has heard that it is essentially
Rogers' bill with one change -- one year for implementation, rather than
6-months in Roger's original proposal._

I will keep you posted if I hear more.
