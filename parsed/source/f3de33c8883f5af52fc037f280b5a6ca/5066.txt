TEXT:
fyi -- As we had heard was a possibility, for House floor consideration,
Goodling has requested a "self-executing" rule, under which the voucher
bill (HELP) would come up first, then the charter schools bill, and then
once both bills have passed the voucher bill would automatically be added
to the charter bill before it goes over to the Senate.
