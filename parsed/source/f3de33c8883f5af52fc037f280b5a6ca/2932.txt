I guess she's had enough teasing for today.

One thing we should do ASAP for our own protection and the President's:
We've got to change SMAT's spin to explain that this Administration has
already done an enormoUs amount, and is alre'ady proposing an enormous
amount, to expand education opportunity, combat stereotypes, and make life
materially better for people of all races.   We can't make it sound like
we're starting from scratch.
