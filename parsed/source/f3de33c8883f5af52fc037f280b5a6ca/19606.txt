    TEXT:
    We have been working with Rand, but they did not want us involved in the
    release of the study because they were concerned it might seem political.
    We did plan to highlight the findings in some way.

    Did we do something with this study before?

    Saturday's New York Times has an article by Tamar Lewin entitled "Early
    Aid is Shown to Benefit At-Risk Children". The story cites a RAND study
    that showed several positive results from nine early intervention programs
    studied, including higher long-term school achievement, less need for
    special ed, lower delinquency rates, fewer emergency room visits and less
    dependency on welfare.

    There must be a way we can use this, or refer to this, or do an event
    around this. How can we use this to promote POTUS' agenda?
