TEXT:
DOL is working on the notice for the next round of WtW competitive
grants. We think they are envisioning a single large competition in '99,
rather than several rounds as we had this year. We'd like your input reo
"set asides" and timing before discussing w/ DOL tomorrow.

They have proposed setting aside $30 M for a separate subcompetition for
each of three priority areas -- disabilities, non-custodial parents, and
transportation. We were planning to suggest adding (1) substance abuse
and (2) basic skills/ESL (maybe under a category called integrated work
and learning).  If we had to prioritize, I'd suggest dropping
transportation since we've got Access to Jobs and WtW grantees can still
do transportation even w/o a subcompetition (but apparently this is a
priority for the Secretary). The dollar level also seems rather low (
we're verifying what % of the total available this is).

DOL's proposed schedule is to publish the notice on January 12th, followed
by a series of bidders conferences around the country beginning Jan.
14th.   We think it would make more sense to delay a week til after SOU.
Secretary Herman could then use this to amplify any SOU messages reo
literacy, substance abuse, fathers, and WtW reauthorization. What do you
think?
