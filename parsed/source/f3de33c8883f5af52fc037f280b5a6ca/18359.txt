TEXT:
Elena,

I have made plans to attend the Advisory Board meeting in Phoenix tomorrow
and Wednesday (though, b/c of the distance and flight times, I will not be
back in the office until Friday). As I mentioned in an e-mail yesterday,
both folks at the PIR and Lynn Cutler (b/c of the Native American meeting
Wed. night) have urged my attendance.  Please let me know if you think
this isn't a good idea. Thanks.

Julie
