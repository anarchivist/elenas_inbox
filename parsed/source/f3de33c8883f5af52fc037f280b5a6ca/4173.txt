Subject:

        John, I understand that you have already heard from Gov Dean on
FLSA, and he has made the request of you to call Gov. Carper.

         Quick background. Since the discussions in Las Vegas on FLSA,  the
Governors have continued to meet to draft NGA policy.   Their effort
resulted in a 4 part proposal drafted and circulated by Gov Carper
 (forwarded in hard copy ). It went significantly beyond our posture in
Vegas (FICA and FUDA exemption) in weakening the work requirements and we
have indicated to the Governors that we do not support their effort to
turn this into NGA policy. We have made both this substantive argument as
well as a political argument that NGA policy at this time plays into the
Speaker's hands. We have worked very hard to peel individual Governor's
off the Carper proposal and we think he is ready to pull back. In a
conference call at noon today with representitives of the Democratic
Governors who are on the NGA Executive Committee (Romer, Dean, Carper,
Chiles, and Miller), we (DPC and IGA) reaffirmed our opposition to the
Carper approach but promised to work hard with Carper and other Governors
to "solve" the problem. Gov Dean and Gov Romer both have weighed in with
Carper and believe he will drop NGA policy if he gets a similar assurance
from you.

           Governor Carper is in Dover at 302-739-4101
