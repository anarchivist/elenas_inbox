TEXT:
I have scheduled a meeting with the Booze-Allen contractors, Bob Bach of
INS and Bob Diegleman of Justice Management to discuss the scope of the
INS restructuring contract, DPC/OMB recommendations for a restructured
INS, our expectations for deliverables, and a timetable that supports the
President's Budget.

The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, January 21 at 10:30 a.m. in
Michael's office Room 246 (the room may need to change depending on the
Booze-Allen/INS contingent) .

If you have any questions, please let me know.   Thanks.
