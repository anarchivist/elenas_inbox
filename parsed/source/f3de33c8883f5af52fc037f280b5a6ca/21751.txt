TEXT:
For the first time ever, I do not believe I have any weekly inserts for
you. Turkey week precludes much happening.   I forwarded you that one
insert on the stem cell issue, which I think will be adequate for a report
to the President on this issue. The only other immediate issue to me
appears to be related to the Labor Department's amicus, which we already
sent in last week and recent developments would not be particularly useful
at this point.  Hope you agree ...

p.s.  I still need to talk with Elena re any issues/concerns/edits she has
with the stem cell letter.  please call as soon as you can. Thanks.
