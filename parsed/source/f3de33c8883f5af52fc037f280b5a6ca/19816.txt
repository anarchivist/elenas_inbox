TEXT:
Wellstone will offer an amendment to the higher ed bill next week to let
college count as a work activity for up to 24 months.  It also increases
the amount of time that vocational education.can count as work from 12
months to 24 months.  I was writing up a paragraph opposing Wellstone when
I realized perhaps you would want to put this in the weekly, given the
President's ongoing interest/concern about stories that college students
on welfare are having to drop out of school.

Below is (1) a draft item for the weekly, in case you want to use it;   (2)
a draft paragraph opposing Wellstone to put into our SAP; and (3) a
description of the amendment.

possible weekly Addendum
Wellstone Pushes to Permit College Attendance to Count as Work Under
Welfare Law -- Next week, Senator Wells tone plans to offer an amendment to
the Higher Education reauthorization bill that would (1) permit college
attendance to count toward the welfare lawD,s participation rates for up
to two years; (2) increase the amount of time that vocational education
can count as work from one year to two years; and (3) increase the overall
cap on these activities by not making teen parents subject to the cap.

We plan to oppose these changes because they would weaken the welfare
lawD,s work requirements.  To date, we have opposed all proposals to
weaken these requirements.  We believe that the considerable flexibility
that the welfare law gives states is adequate to allow them to consider
the individual circumstances of TANF recipients.  Even when the work
requirements are fully phased in, only 50% of the caseload must be
working.  Since states may count caseload reductions toward the work
requirements, the dramatic drops of the past few years will make this goal
far easier to meet.   States can also help college students to combine
work with welfare. We have urged colleges to use the work-study program
as one means to that end.


Draft SAP language:
The Administration opposes the Wellstone amendment to weaken the welfare
lawD,s work requirements by allowing more education and training
activities to count toward the work participation rates than under current
law. These work requirements were the product of bipartisan agreement,


     and it is not appropriate to weaken them. The welfare law gives states
     considerable flexibility to consider the individual circumstances of TANF
     recipients.


     Description of Wellstone Amendment:
     Wellstone amendment:
     Increases amount of time that voc ed can count as a work activity from 12
     months to 24 months.
     Make post-secondary education a permissible work activity just as voc ed
     is (for up to 24 months); currently, it never counts as work.
     Permanently pulls teen parents out of the cap.  This would increase the
     effective size of the cap by 4% beginning in the year 2000, when it would
     grow from 8% of the caseload to 14%.

     Last summerD,s change to voc ed cap (this is just as a reminder)
     Raised cap on voc ed from 20% to 30% (we opposed this, although not
     vocally)
     Clarified that the base to which cap applies is those working, not the
     entire caseload; advocates wanted it be the entire caseload (we supported)
     Pulled teen parents (about 4% of caseload) out of the cap for the first
     two years of TANF (not an irrational change, since teen parents were
     eating up most of the cap in the first two years, when the cap was
     smallest)
