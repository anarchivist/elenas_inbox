                    STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

                          The Rose Garden


12:13 P.M. EDT



              THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. Today, Congress returns
to work and to its obligation to act on the most critical public
health threat to our children. Over the next five weeks, this
Congress has an historic opportunity to pass bipartisan comprehensive
legislation to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco. We
must not let this opportunity slip away.

              The facts are plain as the stakes are high: Three
thousand children begin to smoke every day, even though it's illegal
in every state, and 1,000 will die earlier because of it. All these
children have been targeted by a massive, multimillion-dollar media
campaign that preys on their insecurities and their dreams.

              For decades, we now know from their own documents that
tobacco companies targeted children; and for decades, the industry
denied it. Now, the tobacco industry once again seeks to put its
bottom line above what should be our bottom line, the health of our
children. In today's newspaper, the lead lobbyist for the tobacco
industry says, and I quote: "Weare fighting for our life." Well,
let me be clear: We are fighting for the lives of our children. We
are fighting for the public health, and we are fighting against
                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 HeX-Dump Conversion .
children.

              In the days to come, the tobacco industry will doubtless
raise objection after objection and will work behind closed doors to
persuade Congress to pass half measures that will not reduce teen
smoking. But I believe the majority of the American people and,
indeed, the majority of Congress, members of both parties in
Congress, will see this for what it is -- a tobacco industry smoke
screen.

              I ask Congress and the American people to focus on the
real opportunity now within our reach. Over the next five weeks,
Congress must move forward on comprehensive bipartisan legislation to
reduce teen smoking by raising the price of cigarettes, putting into
place tough restrictions on advertising, and access in imposing
penalties on the industry if it continues to sell cigarettes to
children. We can do that and protect the tobacco farmers at the same
time.

              The legislation now moving through the Senate, authored
by Senator McCain, which was voted out of committee on a nearly
unanimous bipartisan vote three weeks ago now is a strong step in the
right direction. This is not a time for half measures; that simply
won't reduce teen smoking and it will only play into the tobacco
industry's hands. It is a time for the kind of comprehensive
approach to the problem that Senator McCain's legislation takes.

              We have an opportunity and an obligation now to put
aside politics, to tum aside the pleas of special interests, to act
in the interest of the health of generations of our children. I call
on Congress to do so, and I look forward to working with them in good
faith over the next few weeks.

             Q   The suggestions that Speaker McCain -- rather not,
McCain -- pardon me.

             THE PRESIDENT: Is he running for speaker?

             Q No, but perhaps he should. Speaker Gingrich wants
to water down the bill and House Republicans; there have been those
suggestions. What's your reading of Speaker Gingrich's position and
what position should he take?
                                                                          Hex-DiJmp Conversion ·

              THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me say, before his recent
comments I had been encouraged, because he basically said that he
would not permit us to take a stronger position than he did. I was
concerned by his reported comments; you know, I wasn't here in the
country, I didn't hear them, I didn't see the context of them. But I
certainly hope that he will return to his former position.

               We need this to be a bipartisan effort. We need
everybody working together. And we can do this. We can work through
all of the differences that are out there, and we can pass a bill
that will clearly, dramatically reduce teen smoking. We can do it.
And we've got fresh evidence from the Journal of the American Medical
Association, showing that the role of advertising on children and
their smoking habits has been even greater than peer pressure. We've
got all this evidence out there and we know what to do, we know how
to do it, we can do it. And I'm just hoping and praying that we
will. Thank you.
