TEXT:
USDA sees this announcement of the salvage directive as being made
next Monday or Tuesday. They are not inclined to have it made
while the Secretary is out West today and tomorrow, and they
realize the press announcement and Q&A's will need some
interagency vetting.  Their preference is that the Secretary make
the announcement. We may get a draft of their press release and
Q&A's at the end of today, and will send it around for comment
when we do.
I raised the issue of coordination with Democrats in Congress
working on salvage bills. Anne Kennedy and Jim Lyons met last
friday with staff from Furse, Daschle, Wyden, Murray, Fazio, and
Miller's office. They believe the directive now under review met
their concerns, such as no more than 25% green timber· component
without further review.
Let us know by early afternoon if you have any comments on the
draft directive, or other questions.
