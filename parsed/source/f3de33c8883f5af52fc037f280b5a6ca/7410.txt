TEXT:
We are supposed to decide on this today.  Riley wants to send a letter to
the Hill saying he'll recommend a veto of a bill by Riggs.  The bill is
scheduled for a markup next Wed. in the House.  There is no companion
Senate bill at this time.

Disabled children have a federal civil right to an education until they
are 21. California doesn't want to honor this right for juveniles in
adult prisons.   Before last year's IDEA amendments, the penalty for this
was (1) withholding all special funds and (2) taking action in court.
Under the deal struck last year when IDEA was reauthorized, the first
penalty was reduced to withholding only the small amount of funds
associated with these students.  The second penalty was not touched.

(Education made one other noteworthy compromise on this last year:  Under
last year's IDEA deal, youth only have rights if they had previously been
identified as disabled.  If they are identified as disabled in prison, the
state is no longer under any obligation to education them.)

Education is now going after California in court. Riggs is mad, because
he thought he reduced the penalty to the lesser monetary sanction.
Education's position is that last year's deal didn't affect their right to
take court action.  Riggs' current bill would take away Education's power
to go after California in court.

I think all of us in DPC basically support Riley making the argument in
strong terms that this was a deal where we made compromises last year, and
we don't want to reopen it. But we are not comfortable with the veto
threat. Education will probably appeal this; my guess is that OMB will
side with Education. Let us know if you agree with us.   Colleagues, let
me know if I've misstated any of your positions.
