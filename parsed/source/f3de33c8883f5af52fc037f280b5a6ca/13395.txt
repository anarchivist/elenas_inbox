PRINTER FONT 12_POINT_ROMAN
Last month, Senator Hatfield stated to Administration officials
that court interpretations had stretched the implementation of
the Rescissions Act timber rider far beyond what he had intended.
Indeed, the Senator stated that the courts had "a different
interpretation than I had understood. The federal district court
has removed the fundamental authority I thought was vested in
Jack Ward Thomas" to avoid harvesting sales that would adversely
affect threatened marbled murre lets or that had other serious
problems.
Contrast that statement with language in the Senate
Appropriations Committee report for the Omnibus appropriations
bill that actually endorses the very court decisions referenced
by Senator Hatfield. The report language specifically endorses


each and every ruling by Judge Hogan, who sits in the federal
district court in Oregon and has repeatedly ruled against the
federal government on questions of geographical scope, injunctive
relief, identity of purchasers and the standard for determining
whether marbled murrelets are nesting in a given area.  Indeed,
the language is so precisely supportive of these court decisions
that it will no doubt appear in the timber industry's next
relevant brief.
Senator Hatfield went on to say during his meeting with the Chief
of Staff and other officials that he wanted to give the
Administration the flexibility to go back to his original intent
and to allow for substitution of alternative timber. Yet the
language that he and Senator Gorton have offered in the omnibus
bill accomplishes neither of those goals.  First, it simply does
not even purport to address the expansive interpretations of the
rider rendered by Judge Hogan. Second, the authority their
language would provide the Administration for replacement timber
or buy
o
-back authority is constrained by unrealistic timeframes
and the requirement that the land management agencies have to
negotiate with the timber companies over either price or
replacement timber.  Further, it would force the land management
agencies to continue harvesting timPer until such an agreement is
reached, and would shield replacement timber sales from the
application of environmental laws. All of these features are
unacceptable to the Administration.
