challenging Americans to make Martin Luther King Day a day of national

(including friends and families) served the D.C. community - - painting at
Cardozo High, running around the Natural History Museum with Horton's Kids
and sorting long underwear at Martha's Table. This year, we invite you,
your family and friends to make it another "day on" at one of the
following locations.  Please review the list below and sign up early:
