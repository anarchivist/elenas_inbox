TEXT:
As you know, the states "going home" issues are:

1. The Enzi amendment on Indian Gaming (we are on opposite side)
2. Tobacco recoupment (I have little sense that they will make progress on
this)
3. Internet Tax ( We will sign any bill - weather or not it enjoys states
support)
4. Cost Allocation on Medicaid (still outstanding - but the Hall of the
States crowd says that the Hill Republicans are going for it and blaming
it on us since it was in our budget) .
5. Ed-Flex.

In short, I really need us to step up our commitment on Ed Flex - or else
I probably have little positive to show my guys. Can we push this up our
priorities in the closing negotiations? It is hard for me - after POTUS
lead with it in the Governors Roundtable meeting at NGA last Feb. - to
explain our perceived passivity (fair claim or not) on this.
