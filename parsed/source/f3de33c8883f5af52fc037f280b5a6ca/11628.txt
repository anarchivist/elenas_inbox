H.R. 800 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
(Rep.Castle (R) DE and 65 cosponsors)

The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 800, which would expand
the D&Ed-FlexD8 demonstration authority to permit all States that meet the
eligibility criteria to waive certain statutory and regulatory
requirements of Federal education programs. The Administration has long
supported the concept of expanding ed-flex demonstration authority in a
manner that will promote high standards and accountability for results,
coupled with increased flexibility for States and local school districts
to achieve those results.

The Administration is pleased with the amendments made by the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce to D&sunsetD8 the bill upon
reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (to
ensure consistency between that statute and Ed-Flex), terminate local
waivers if achievement levels decline, and require public notice and
comment before waivers are requested and granted.

The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
offered to H.R. 800 that would implement the President's proposal for a
long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts


     reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
     year on a bipartisan basis.  In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange
     for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to
     reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible,
     that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one
     year.

     The Administration also supports amendments designed to further strengthen
     accountability for results in the Ed-Flex program, and to ensure that
     Federal education dollars continue to reach the students they were
     designed to serve.
