        D&We are all created equal.DS It is the simplest, most powerful
idea ever set forth by humankind.  And yet, from the moment Thomas
Jefferson put ink to paper 223 years ago in Philadelphia, the struggle to
honor these ideals has been AmericaD,s most difficult -- and enduring --
challenge.

        Throughout our history, Americans of courage and V1S10n have
stepped forward -- sometimes risking their lives -- to lead us in
AmericaD,s ongoing march toward justice.   I thank you for working to
chronicle their journey in this exhibit.



        Perhaps no one in this century did more to open the doors to D&the
glorious temple of American LibertyDs [Frederick Douglass, quoted by
previous speaker]  and move America further along the path of freedom and
justice than the man we honor and remember tonight, Thurgood Marshall.

        Tonight, we honor the courage of a man who traveled to the towns
of the segregated south -- places where he could not find a bite to eat
when hungry, a bed to rest in when tired, or a police officerD,s
protection when threatened -- to argue passionately for the basic dignity
of all Americans. We honor the genius of a man who masterminded a
strategy to dismantle Jim Crow case by case, trial by trial, decision by
decision, from Baltimore to Topeka to Little Rock to the United States
Supreme Court. And we honor the commitment of a man, who as a member of
the highest court in the land, remained a tireless champion of the
freedoms and rights of every individual, especially the least among us.

        The 14th Amendment -- and its promise of equal protection under
the law -- was Thurgood MarshallD,s sword and shield.  Like Lincoln, who
saw how the ideals embedded in the Declaration of Independence compelled
us to crack open the bonds of slavery, Thurgood Marshall saw how the
fourteenth amendment could knock down the walls of segregation. He
breathed life into a moribund amendment and transformed it into a living
charter of freedom -- as vital a guardian of our ideals as the Declaration
of Independence and the Bill of Rights.

        The legacy of the 14th Amendment, the legacy of Justice Marshall
-- the legacy of his mentor Charles Houston and colleagues such as Wiley
Branton and Jack Greenberg -- can be seen all across this country:   In
classrooms where children of all races learn side by side; in libraries
and restaurants and drinking fountains that serve all people; in the
educations and careers and lives of every man and woman in this room.
But the road to freedom and justice is long -- we have far to go. Today,
we can honor Thurgood Marshall not only with grand buildings and museum
exhibits, but by continuing his lifeD,s work.

        We can honor Thurgood Marshall and equality under the law by
fighting discrimination in all its forms.  No one should be denied a job,
a home, an education, a chance at the American Dream because of race,
disability, gender, sexual orientation or religion.

        We can honor Thurgood Marshall and equality under the law by
ensuring men and women receive equal pay for equal work.

        We can honor Thurgood Marshall and equality under the law by
working to give every single one of todayD,s children -- of every race,
color and creed -- the opportunity to learn in a 21st Century school with
well-trained teachers, high academic standards and modern facilities.

        During some of the darkest days of Jim Crow, a single phrase
whispered in African American communities all across the South gave hope
to thousands -- D&Thurgood is coming.Ds Today, at the dawn of a new
century, it is up to each and everyone of us to ensure that Thurgood does
indeed come. Let us take up his sword and shield, honor our highest
ideals and work as One America to bring justice and freedom to every
corner of this great land in the 21st Century.
