TEXT:
Several issues are floating that need WH decision and coordination
prior to the Monday NGA/NCSL/APWA meeting:
- are we OK ~ith the HHS guidance document (you all have a copy)
- are we OK with HHS proposal on 45 day comment period
- are we OK on the proposed approach to waivers outlined in the
guidance?
Other issues are obviously out there (Cal Food Stamps, SSI kids
timing, etc.) but the three above need our input ASAP.
Dorothy is calling your offices to try to set this up.
