TEXT:
1. After the last immigration meeting last week, John Morton asked me if
it was our understanding that if DOJ agrees to the broad policy proposal
on parity legislation that we would not seek "administrative" fixes such
as DED while the legislation is pending.  Please let me know if that you
was understanding.

2.    State Dept. rationale on the broad policy proposal - DOJ is reviewing
this rationale to determine if it provides the rationale that they are
seeking. You should have received a copy of it.    If not, please let me
know.      We should plan to discuss at the Immigration Work Group meeting
this Friday unless you think we need a separate meeting.

3. NACARA Reg - DOJ sent OMB a draft of the NACARA reg.     please contact
Stuart Shapiro if you would like a copy.  (Elena/Laura - I will send you a
copy) .  We should discuss this draft at the meeting at the immigration
meeting as well and begin thinking about next steps (consultations,
roll-out, etc).

please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts about these
items.

Thanks.
