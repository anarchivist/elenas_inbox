DRAFT NOT FOR RELEASE

The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
united States Senate
Washington, D.C.  20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's
views on the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as
reported by the Senate Subcommittee. As the Full Committee develops its
version of the bill, your consideration of the Administration's views
would be appreciated.

        The allocation of discretionary resources available to the
Committee under the Congressional Budget Resolution is simply inadequate
to make the necessary investments that our citizens need and expect.  The
PresidentD,s FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending that
meet such needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by
making savings proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help
finance this spending.  Congress has approved and the President has signed
into law nearly $29 billion of such offsets in appropriations legislation
since 1995. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such


proposals.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Subcommittee to
accommodate certain of the President's priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the Subcommittee bill is nearly $300 million below
the program level requested by the President and includes significant
reductions in a number of high priority programs detailed below. We look
forward to working with the Committee to make certain that vital funding
is provided for these programs.

Department of Energy

         The Administration is concerned with the large shift in the
Subcommittee bill from key domestic priorities of the Department of Energy
 (DOE) to fund Atomic Energy Defense Activities.  The bill provides $319
million less than the President's request for DOE's domestic programs ($85
million less than FY 1999) and adds $261 million to the President's
request for defense activities ($567 million more ~han FY 1999, excluding
a one-time emergency supplemental appropriation). The bill would
drastically reduce vital programs in energy research and other activities
to fund unrequested enhancements to nuclear weapons and other defense
activities.   Specific cuts include:



00      abSolar and Renewable Energy. The Administration strongly
opposes the $97 million reduction from the President's request level for
research and development (R&D) in solar and renewable resources
technologies. Our global future depends in many ways on the early
introduction of renewable energy technologies to reduce the potential
impacts of pollution and climate change and make available affordable
energy sources. Yet, the Subcommittee mark would cripple the
Administration's efforts to expand and capitalize on R&D success in the
solar and renewable energy programs.

00      abEnvironmental Management. The Administration opposes the $40
million reduction to the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and
Decommissioning Fund and the $16 million reduction in the Non-Defense
Environmental Management account.  At the Subcommittee-recommended funding
levels, the Oak Ridge Reservation would be unable to meet legal
requirements in environmental laws and enforceable agreements, and
completion of cleanup activities at sites such as Weldon Spring, Missouri,
would be significantly delayed.

00      abYucca Mountain. The Administration opposes the reduction of
$39 million from the request for the civilian radioactive waste program.
This reduction would significantly reduce the quality of scientific,
engineering, and design work that will be available to guide DOE's FY 2001
site suitability determination for Yucca Mountain and would jeopardize
DOE's ability to meet its FY 2002 license application milestone.

00      abScience.  The Administration opposes the $27 million reduction
to the request for construction of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).
We continue to believe that the FY 2000 request represents the optimum
funding level. As the funding level decreases, the risk of project cost
increases and delays rise.  Construction of the SNS must be completed in a
timely manner to enable our best scientists to explore critical problems
in fundamental science and applications for our materials and
biotechnology industries.


Further, the Administration opposes the lack of funding in the bill for
the Information Technology Initiative for the 21st Century and for the
Next Generation Internet Initiative.  Both of these initiatives would
propel revolutionary breakthroughs in information technology and
scientific computing in the United States.

The Administration is also disappointed that the Subcommittee has not
accepted the Administration's proposal to revise the financing of the
Power Marketing Administration's Purchase Power and Wheeling programs.
The Administration would like to continue to work with the Committee to
restructure the funding mechanism for these programs.

        C       Departmental Administration.  The Administration opposes
the reductions in Departmental Administration programs proposed in the
Subcommittee bill.  The proposed reductions would impair implementation of
Secretarial management initiatives now underway to restructure field
management, reorganize security functions, enforce reductions in
contractor travel and other overhead costs, and improve construction
management.

Army Corps of Engineers

        The Administration is concerned that the $183 million reduction to
the President's request for the Army Corps of Engineers would result in
significant delays for certain critical construction projects.  Of
particular concern are reductions to the Columbia River Fish Mitigation
project, from $100 million to $70 million; the Everglades (FL) project,
from $110 million to $93 million; and, the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay
Channel (NY, NJ) project, from $60 million to $40 million.

Bureau of Reclamation

        The Subcommittee proposal to reduce the Bureau of Reclamation
budget by $100 million, or 12 percent, would significantly affect the
BureauO,s ability to continue to operate its water supply projects
throughout the West in compliance with relevant Federal regulations.  The
Administration urges the Committee to restore these funds.

        We also urge the Committee to fully fund the $95 million request
for the CALF ED Bay-Delta program. The Subcommittee's $50 million
reduction and accompanying funding restrictions would delay Federal and
State efforts to restore this important ecosystem.

        In addition we urge the Committee to enact the Administration's
proposal to convert the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund from a
current discretionary to a permanent account.  This will allow the Bureau
of Reclamation to operate the program efficiently and ensure that all the
authorized collections from project beneficiaries are used to mitigate
project impacts, as intended by the Central Valley Project Improvement
Act.

        We look forward to working with the Committee to address our
mutual concerns.

                                                Sincerely,




                                                Jacob J. Lew


                                                Director

Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Ted Stevens,
The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, The Honorable Pete V. Domenici,
and The Honorable Harry M. Reid
