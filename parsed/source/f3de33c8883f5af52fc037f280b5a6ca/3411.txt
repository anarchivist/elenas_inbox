TEXT:
This was a pre-unveiling, nothing has gone to Katzen yet, and there will
be a lot of issues to slog through.   I haven't sent you the grandfathering
waivers stuff yet; I will today. HHS wants the reg to say that states can
use the exemptions and time limits from their waivers instead of the
law's; Bruce noted he remembered the resolution very differently in Leon's
office. We have a bit of time on this.

where are we on these? I know i missed a meeting last week. Diana, you
asked me after that meeting about grandfathering waivers and said you'd
send me some materials to jog my memory.  Do I have those somewhere? And
are there any other issues? And does Sally Katzen now have this reg, or
are we doing a kind of pre-OMB review first?
