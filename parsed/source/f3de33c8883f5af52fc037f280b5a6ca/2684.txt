1. National Test Initiative: Mike Cohen and Secretary Riley met with Governors on the NGA
Executive Committee (Govs. Romer, Leavitt, B. Miller, and Thompson, and Gov. Hunt and
Geringer participating by phone) to discuss the national test initiative. Govs. Romer, Hunt and
Miller were all very supportive. Gov. Leavitt indicated that he was comfortable with the
initiative, wanted a chance to discuss it with his chief state school officer, and barring any
problems would be prepared to support the initiative and have Utah participate. Gov. Thompson
was noncommittal; his primary concerns centered on who in the state decides if the state will
participate. Because that authority in Wisconsin resides with the chief state school officer (a
position Gov. Thompson has unsuccessfully fought to eliminate) we suspect Gov. Thompson will
not be an active supporter. Gov. Miller and Romer will be exploring the prospects assembling a
bipartisan group of governors to express support for this initiative, and of an NGA endorsement
at the summer meeting. While additional bipartisan gubernatorial support for the testing initiative
is clearly possible, they believe an NGA endorsement may ultimately be more difficult. We will
continue to work closely with them to build the broadest possible support among the Governors.


2. Perkins Vocational Education Reauthorization Proposal: Early next week, the
Department of Education expects to transmit to Congress the Carl. D. Perkins Career Preparation
Education Act, which would restructure the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act to strengthen support for school-to-work systems, consolidate numerous voc-ed
programs, better integrate voc-ed with broad, standards-based school reform, and provide states
with more flexibility.

The Department's legislation would streamline 23 existing Perkins programs into three main
programs, including a flexible state grant, Tech-Prep education, and a national program authority
that could fund research, evaluation, technical assistance and investments in professional
development, curriculum improvement and related activities. For the State grant program,
activities that were formerly set-asides or categorical (such as programs for displaced
homemakers and criminal offenders) would no longer be required, but would still be allowable.
The bill also establishes new accountability provisions and a system of performance goals and
indicators.

The Education Department expects the House Education and the Workforce Committee
Republicans to adopt much of the Administration proposal in its bill, though there is likely to be
some resistance to our efforts to explicitly link the programs in this bill to the School-to-Work
Program, because of continuing opposition from the right wing.

School Districts in which 100 languages are spoken: You have said on a number of occasions
that we have four school districts now where the children's first languages comprise over 100
different languages. We have asked the Education Department to verify this number and to
identify the specific school districts. According to the Education Department, which has made
independent verification with state and local education agencies, there are in fact now five school
districts which enroll large numbers of students who speak languages other than English, and one
                                                                                   Management System

Prince George's County MD (128); Montgomery County MD (119); DC Public Schools (116);
Fairfax County VA (over 100). In addition, Chicago enrolls students speaking 96 different
languages.
