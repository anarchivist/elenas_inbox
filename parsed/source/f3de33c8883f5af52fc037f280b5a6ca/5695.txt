TEXT:
OMB has sent to HHS for comment three child support options, saying "a
decision has been made to include the following items on a list of
potential proposals for the FY 1999 budget."

All the options would convert child support enforcement funding into a
block grant and require states to impose a $25 collection fee on
non-custodial parents from non-welfare families (states could pass
legislation to reduce or increase this fee).
Converting funding to a block grant may discourage state spending to
collect support for families, since states will have to pay 100% of any
"extra" costs. The fee collection position is a reversal for the
Administration, which has apparently opposed such fees in the past, ahd
would likely to be opposed by women's and other advocacy groups (who
believe that since so many non-custodial parents don't pay the full amount
owed, families will end up with $25 less per month in child support, since
the fee will be deducted from the less-than-full-amount paid).
The options would also let states keep all the collections from welfare
families and, as in current law, would distribute incentive funds based on
peformance.

Three Specific Options:   Within this framework, OMB has proposed three
options:

Option #1 would set the block grant at a level to save about $300 million,
the amount that states would collect through the new $25 fees.  In other
words,  since states would collect $300 million in fees, the federal
government would reduce its contribution to the states by $300 million.

Option #2 would set the block grant at a level to save about $1.8
billion.

Option #3 would set the block grant at a level to save about $3.0
billion.




Current Structure: Currently, the federal government pays 66 percent of
general child support· costs incurred by the states. States must provide
the federal government with a share of child support collections from
non-custodial parents of welfare families (to recoup the costs of welfare
payments made to those families).   The federal government also pays states
incentive payments based on performance. Overall, the federal government
loses money on child support enforcement and the state governments gain
money.

Block Grant Proposal: RainesD, proposal would provide states with a block
grant for operating expenses and require them to maintain their current
spending in exchange for being able to keep all the collections from
welfare families.  In addition, the feds would distribute incentive funds
based on peformance. The block grant amount could be set so that overall,
the federal government saves money compared to current spending (OMB has
drafted two versions, one which saves $1.8 billion, and the other which
saves almost $3.0 billion, although a revenue neutral proposal could be
structured). OMB envisions that while this option would provide states
with less money to collect child support, they could easily make up the
difference by add a fee to the child support collected from non-custodial
parents of non-welfare families.
