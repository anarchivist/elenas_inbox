TEXT:
Scott Ballin from Tobacco Free Kids says that he doesn't think the health
groups will say anything about a discount the companies may get.  He says
he has discussed this with Matt Myers.  In addition, he says he told the
farmers "do what you have to do,  just don't let them think they are on
your side."
