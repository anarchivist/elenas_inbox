TEXT:
Elena: Just talked with Kevin, and had a brief chat with George. I made
the 'uncertainty of the science' arguments. But, HHS feels it has sound
reasons for interpreting the science in a way that leads to their new
level. HHS, therefore, is prepared to proceed with the release of 0.3 on
Thursday. Kevin asked that any further discussion, if necessary, take
place before then. He emphasized that the process cannot be stopped once
he gives the 'go' . I need to get with Rosina Bierbaum, here in ostp, and
go over their explanation of how they are handling the science issues.
We'll catch up with you and George later in the day. Neal
