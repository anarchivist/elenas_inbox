TEXT:
I think we should be prepared for press inquiries on the family planning

annoucement today (let's hope someone cares about policy today). If Neera

could clean up the two pager to be in releaseable form,   I think that would

do it. Do you think we need q and a's as well? The speech is around 1:00

pm so we should get this ready this morning and get it to WH press folks

as well as OVP press folks. thanks.
