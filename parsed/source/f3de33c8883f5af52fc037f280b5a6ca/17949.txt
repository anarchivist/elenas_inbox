     Lynn,
     I thought that you would be interested to know that in the OMB
     "passback" for the FY 99 budget, OMB denied the Department's request
     to fund $16 million in demonstration discretionary programs for
Indian
     Education. These programs, which Congress de-funded two years ago,
are
     ones that you have heard so much about from Indian country. We will
be
     making an appeal to OMB to re-consider its position. I certainly hope
     that they do ... Jim kohlmoos 12/2
