Message Creation Date was at 24-SEP-1996 18:06:00

We have heard conflicting reports today regarding an effort to revive and move
Rep. Lazio's public housing reform bill.   As you know, there is as yet no
approved Conference Report.

Lazio's staff claim that the Speaker (and possibly Sen. Lott) are interested in
having a bill. They report that Rep. Lazio will present a revised conference
report to the Conference on Thursday accommodating the Administration's main
concerns, and expect to be given floor time and a scheduled vote Friday or
Saturday.

HUD A/S for Legislation Hal DeCe11 remains deeply skeptical that action will
occur, particularly in the Senate where Sens. Mack and D'Amato have been cool
to a bill.
Nevertheless, given the speed with which things are moving or could move, I
want to at least put this on your radar.
