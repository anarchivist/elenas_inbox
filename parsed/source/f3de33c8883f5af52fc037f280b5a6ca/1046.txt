                          President Clinton Announces First Actions
                      under FDA's Rule to Protect Children from Tobacco
                                      February 28, 1997
                                         -- DRAFT--

Announcement
o    President Clinton announced that today the Federal government is taking the first
     steps under the Food and Drug Administration's rule to restrict children's access to
     tobacco products. Beginning today, provisions of FDA's rule:
     o      prohibit retailers from selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to
            anyone under age 18.
     o      require retailers to verify age by photo ID for anyone under the age of 27
            purchasing tobacco products.

Background
o       President Clinton announced the final FDA rule to protect children form tobacco on
        August 23, 1996. The rule seeks to reduce children's tobacco use by 50% over seven
        years by restricting children's access to tobacco and to reducing the appeal of cigarettes
        and smokeless tobacco products to children. The first two provisions of the rule take
        effect today.
o       Youth smoking is on the rise. Each day about 3000 American children become regular
        smokers. Of these, 1,000 will die early from tobacco-related illness. In the past six
        years, the smoking rate among eighth graders has risen 50%. Today the average teenage
        smoker begins to smoke at 14 Y2 years old and becomes a daily smoker before age 18.
o       Youth have widespread access to tobacco products. Although selling cigarettes to
        people under 18 is already against the law in all 50 states, studies show that young people
        easily obtain tobacco products. Most children and adolescents who smoke purchase their
        own cigarettes. National data from the 1995 Youth Risk Behavior Survey show that
        over three-quarters of
 high school students under age 18 who had purchased cigarettes in the previous month had not
been asked by a clerk to show proof of age. Local studies have shown that enforcement of
minors' access laws -- especially laws requiring the retailer to check for proof of age -- can
significantly reduce the percentage of retailers who sell cigarettes to minors.

Additional Provisions to Restrict Access and Reduce Appeal Take Effect Later this Year
.0    On August 28,1997, additional provisions of FDA's rule become effective. They
       include: prohibiting billboards within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds and
       restricting other outdoor advertising to black-and -white text only; permitting
      black-and-white text only advertising in publications with significant youth readership;
      prohibiting the sale or giveaways of products like caps or gym bags that carry cigarette or
      smokeless tobacco product brand names or logos; and prohibiting vending machines and .
      self-service displays except in places where people under 18 are never present.
o     On August 28, 1998, FDA's final rule will prohibit the brand-name sponsorship of
      sporting or entertainment events.
