TEXT:
I spoke with Joan Lombardi and Sara Kovner late last week. We are wanting
to hold some small group meetings around child care with the groups. Joan
suggested we also involve someone from Treasury and Education.  I'd like
to have the first one next Thursday, 2/19 from 3-5pm. Would either of you
be able to attend and participate?

Our goal is 3 or 4 of these over the next month in small groups of no
more that 12-15 each time. thanks
