            Welfare reforms threatened

                Privatizing Food Stamp benefits rejected by U.S.

                By Pat Kossan
                The Arizona Republic
                Dec. 3, 1998

                The federal government slapped down Arizona's proP9sal to
hand
                over its Food Stamp Program to a private company, .a decision
that
                endangers legislative efforts to turn other state-run
benefits
               programs over to for-profit businesses.

                The idea fails to ensure that needy families would have
"fair and
                equitable" access to the benefits, that fraud and abuse
would be
                detected, and that the program would be open to public
scrutiny,
                federal Food Stamp officials said in letter sent Wednesday


to state
               Department of Economic Security Director Linda Blessing.

              This is the first decision the u.s. Department of
Agriculture, which
              oversees the Food Stamp Program, has made about state
requests
              for privatization, a USDA spokesman said. Wisconsin and
Florida
              have also expressed interest in privatization of Food Stamp
              programs and their requests are being reviewed, ~e said.

               Federal officials seemed especially unnerved by the Arizona's
               proposal to give the private vendor bonus payments for
reducing
               the number of people receiving Food Stamps.

               Federal officials call it an example of how the program
doesn't meet
               "the cornerstone of our efforts to guarantee a healthy and
nutri~ious
               diet to all low-income families."

               "The legislature has to relook at this program," said Alfredo
               Gutierrez, a former state senator, now lobbyist, who chairs
the
               board responsible for designing the privatization program and
               finding a ve~dor to manage it.

               "We may have to go back and reconsider our mission and
               re-engineer the (privatization) program," he said.

               About 272,000 Arizona residents receive an average of $78
worth
               of Food Stamps each month, while 96,000 of them also get cash
               welfare benefits averaging $101. Most recipients are
children.

               Determining eligibility for the Food Stamp Program and
distributing
               Food Stamp benefits are only part of a pilot privatization
project
               called Arizona Works, passed by legislators in 1997 and
amended
               in 1998.

               It is designed to make a private business responsible for
moving
               about 20 percent of DES's welfare caseload, or about 5,000
               families mostly in eastern Maricopa County, off Food Stamps
and
               cash welfare benefits and into jobs over the next two years,
               Gutierrez said, threatening the jobs of about 60 state
workers.
               Under law, the private agency must show at least a 10 percent
               savings in administrative costs.

               The Arizona Works Procurement Board awarded the bid Monday
               to MAXIMUS, a national company that runs benefits programs in
               other states, mostly child support programs.



                     But the USDA's decision not to allow distribution of Food
     Stamps
                     to be part of the privatization program could force the
     Procurement
                     Board to cancel that award and reissue its bid requests,
     Gutierrez
                     said.

                     The state Attorney General's Office must review the denial
     l,etter
                     and determine whether the withdrawal of the Food Stamp
     Program
                     changes the original bid proposal and opens the state up to
     legal
                     action by those vendors not awarded the contract.

                     If that decision is made, Gutierrez said the Procurement
     Board
                     would have to start with a new proposal and bid requests and
     could
                     miss its Jan. 5 deadline for issuing a bid reward.

                     But that's not the only problem.

                     DES workers now help welfare parents acquire both Food Stamps
                     and'welfare cash benefits during one interview.

                     If the state is forced to keep its workers to run the Food
     Stamp
                     program, it could mean that funding an additional
     privatization
                     program for other benefits would no longer save the state
     money.

                     "Then the Legislature could choose to end, mend or extend the
                     program," Gutierrez said.

                     The Procurement Board members plan to meet with the Attorney
                     General's Office next week, he said.
