TEXT:
Elena,
I spoke with Michele Cavataio about the chapter on Administration
accomplishments for the President's report. Michele has forwarded to me
her proposal for how to organize the chapter. The idea is to organize it
according to themes of the Administration and use specific policy
accomplishments (over the last 5 1/2 years) to illustrate these themes.
Edley has also asked Paul W. to review the proposal and to think about
identifying themes.  Edley also wants this chapter to include discussions
of how various policy initiatives were developed and the tensions
presented by some of the choices.

It is unclear precisely how this will develop, but Michele and Edley have
suggested that we (including other WH folks, like Michele Waldman) should
work to identify themes and policies to discuss and use to illustrate
those themes. Michele can then take the lead (as Chris's staff person) in
turing this into text.  I have suggested that she and I (and perhaps Edley
and Paul) meet to discuss the particulars of this early next week.
