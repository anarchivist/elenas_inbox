TEXT:
        I think it would be a good idea to have a meeting here with DOJ
and ED to update where we stand on various Title IX issues. We are still
awaiting the government-wide regulations; ED is considering new regs on
single sex classrooms; there is the thorny issue of single sex institution
enforcement policy, and there may be other related issues, too. I would be
happy to convene it, or DPC can. Any thoughts?
