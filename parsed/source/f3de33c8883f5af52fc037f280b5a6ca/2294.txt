                                  Q&A -- 5/18 DRAFT



Company Hiring

Question:   How many companies have committed to hire welfare recipients?

Answer:     Today, XX companies committed to hire people from the welfare rolls --
            and the Partnership's new Chairman, Gerald Greenwald today pledged to sign up
            1,000 companies within six months.

Question:   Will these companies displace other workers in order to hire welfare recipients?

Answer:     No. An explicit part of the commitment each company has made is to hire and
            retain former welfare recipients without displacing other workers.

Question:   Will the companies pay health benefits?

Answer:     We expect companies to treat former welfare recipients like any other
            workers, which includes providing health benefits if they are provided to other
            workers.

Minimum Wage

Question:   Will the Administration's announcement last week that employers must pay
            welfare recipients the minimum wage make it harder for .companies to hire
            welfare recipients?

Answer:     No. Private companies have always had to pay the minimum wage and follow
the
            Fair Labor Standards Act for those workers who are "employees" instead of
            "trainees." The confusion lay primarily in whether the law required
            government-sponsored workfare -- in which welfare recipients work in public
            service projects in exchange for their benefits -- to pay the minimum wage. Our
            lawyers believe that most welfare recipients participating in the work activities
            such as workfare will legally count as "employees."




                                           Automated ReCOrds Management Systerr
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
            for states?

Answer:     Not at all. With both TANF and food stamps counting toward the minimum
            wage, every state except Mississippi will be able to give welfare recipients
            workfare slots for 20 hours a week (the welfare law's current requirement)
            without raising their benefit levels. And of course states should be trying to place
            welfare recipients in private sector jobs where the minimum wage already applies
            -- that's why having so many companies commit today to hiring welfare recipients
            is so important.

Question:   Will the Administration support changes to the welfare law so workfare programs
            don't have to pay the minimum wage?

Answer:     We would oppose legislation that flatly exempts welfare recipients froITl the
            minimum wage law. The Administration believes that people who work should
            be paid at least the minimum wage.

Question:   Would you oppose any legislation addressing this issue?

Answer:     Not necessarily, but any legislation would have to be consistent with our support
            for the minimum wage. In determining how the minimum wage applies to
            workfare, the Administration has had to address a host of technical issues that
            Congress did not deal with in passing the welfare law. If Congress wants to
            address these issues, the Administration will consider the proposals carefully.
            But any legislation must reflect the Administration's position that people who
            work should be paid at least the minimum wage.

Today's Speakers

Question:   Why was Governor Thompson invited to speak?

Answer:     We invited two governors to speak today -- Governor Tommy Thompson (R-
            Wise.) and Governor Tom Carper (D-Del.). Both were intimately involved in
            developing the welfare reform proposals the President signed into law, and both
            have been welfare reform leaders in their own states -- so it seemed appropriate to
            have them here today. In addition, today the President announced transportation
            planning grants to 24 states, which were given in cooperation with the National
            Governors' Association.

                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

Answer:      George R. Stinton is the President and owner of General Converters and
             Assemblers, Inc. in Racine, Wisconsin. More than half his workforce is former
             welfare recipients. He is currently expanding his plant and plans to fill many of
             the 100 new positions with welfare recipients. An African American, Stinson
             says that one of his primary concerns as an employer is to hire and provide
             on-the-job training to persons without much job experience.

White House Hiring

Question:    More than a month ago, the White House pledged to hire welfare recipients?
             Have any been hired?

Answer:      Yes, one former welfare recipient has already been hired, and the departments are·
             reviewing resumes to fill the remaining __ positions.

Welfare Privatization

Question:    I understand Erskine Bowles and other White House officials plan to meet with
             members of the Texas Congressional delegation this week. Is this the beginning
             of a negotiation over welfare privatization?

Answer:      No, we are not taking part in any negotiation. The purpose of the meetings is
             simply to answer any questions the Congressional delegation may have regarding
             the response that the Administration provided to the state of Texas last week
             regarding what kinds of privatization is allowed under current law.

Question:    Is the Administration going to approve Wisconsin's request to privatize welfare
             and food stamp offices in some parts of the state?

Answer:      We have not yet responded to Wisconsin's request.

                                                                  . I-Jpx-Dump Conversion

Question:   Why is the President talking about new transportation funding now, after the
            budget has been agreed to?

Answer:     The Congressional Committees are about to take up the ISTEA reauthorization --
            so now is exactly the right time for the President to highlight the welfare to work
            provisions of the transportation bill he sent to the Hill earlier this spring. Also,
            many of the business leaders involved in the Welfare to Work Partnership have
            told us how important transportation will be to their ability to hire welfare
            recipients, so today's event seemed like a good time to discuss the President's
            welfare to work transportation proposal.

            In general, the budget negotiations assume the reauthorization of ISTEA, although
            the level of transportation spending within the domestic discretionary category has
            been under some discussion recently. But the budget agreement certainly leaves
            room for the President's $600 million welfare to work transportation proposal.

Question:   What does the President's transportation proposal do?

Answer:     The President's NEXTEA transportation bill:

            ·      Invests $600 Million to Improve Access to Jobs and Training.
                   NEXTEA includes a six-year, $600 million grant program to support
                   innovative transportation initiatives, such as vanpools, to get people where
                   the jobs are.

            ·      Creates Job Training Opportunities in Transportation Technology
                   and Construction. NEXTEA opens opportunities in transportation by
                   increasing incentives for states and localities to provide job training in
                   conjunction with federally-funding technology and construction projects
                   and enabling them to offer hiring preferences favoring welfare recipients
                   and residents of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.

Question:   What can the $600 million be used for?

Answer:     States, local governments, and private, non-profit organizations could
            apply for grants to plan and implement new transportation services targeted
            services designed at linking welfare recipients with jobs.

             workers?

Answer:      No. What the President's bill does allow is what are called "local hiring
             preferences" allowing transportation contractors to provide a preference to equally
             qualified welfare recipients and residents of Enterprise Zones and Enterprise
             Communities who apply for transportation-related jobs.

Question:    The President praised a new bipartisan Congressional proposal introduced today
             by Senators Specter and Lautenberg. How does their proposal differ from the
             President's?

Answer:

Question:    Does the President endorse the entire Specter-Lautenberg transportation bill, or
             just the welfare to work provisions?

Answer:

Question:    The grants the President announced today seem pretty small [about $10,000 each].
             Do you expect them to accomplish anything?

Answer:      These grants, provided by the Department of Transportation in cooperation with
             the National Governors' Association, will give states and communities an
             opportunity to enable states to develop strategies that support welfare to work
             efforts. But these are just seed grants -- that's why the President has proposed a
             comprehensive, $600 million fund for welfare to work transportation.

Vice Presidential Announcement [Under review by Elaine Kamarck]

Question:    The Vice President announced he'll chair a conference on May 29th.
             What's the subject?

Answer:      The conference will focus on job retention strategies and will include a panel of
             groups that have helped former welfare recipients become successful workers.

Question:    What's the purpose of the conference?

Answer:      The Vice President and his staff have been meeting with a wide range of civic
             organizations to discuss their role in welfare reform. Of course, many of these
             groups have been contributing to their communities for more than a century, so
             public service is nothing new to them.



                                                                       dR cords Management S~ster

Answer:     The panelists are from a variety of types of programs -- nonprofits, like the Strive
            program in New York which was recently featured on 60 Minutes; America
            Works, the successful, private sector job placement and retention company; and
            public sector, such as the Social Security Administration, which has a long record
            of successfully hiring welfare recipients. The Vice President is particularly
            intrigued by what State Comptroller John Sharp has done in Texas. The Texas
            Pathfinders project has paired welfare recipients with community mentors to help
            them make the transition to self-sufficiency.
