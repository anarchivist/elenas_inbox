TEXT:
DOJ has sent two pleadings today: SCLDF's brief in opposition to
our motion to transfer (yuck) which raises (yeah) the cancellation
issue and the next version of our draft motion to clarify.  Ellen
et al would like to come back over on Monday to meet with you and
I and discuss the draft brief and its relationship to the SCLDF
pleading.
My only firm commitments on Monday are a 12-1 meeting and a 3 pm
dental appointment.  How's your schedule?
