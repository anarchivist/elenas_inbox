TEXT:
I mentioned this to Frank & Bill before the close of the meeting--there
are two issues that were not discussed either in the paper or in the
discussion.   The first is -- that the vacancy/shortage problem does not
manifest itself only at the entry level.   There is more than anecdotal
evidence that vacancies occur at the mid-level (sr analyst, sr programmer
etc) where the result is the current worker is not trained for the
step-up. The second is -- the President's proposal that unions control
and/or have significant partnerhsip w/ industry in the training.
Whatever principles we articulate I suggest that we structure them so that
we are not only talking about "layoffs" but are also talking about
recruiting from and training current workers for advancement/promotion;
and we weave "labor unions" in more than a mention in the training ---- I
say this not for the "politics" of the cirumstance but because I am
concerned that when industry/technology CEO's come to the table --- they
will balk because they never got the drift that we were serious about
union involvement -- and they will hate this.   thanks

Peter/Laura:

        would you please make sure that sally/elena get a copy of this --
I will forward to CC and Tom thanks
