                      Legislation to Ban Human Cloning
                                     2/05/97

Senators Frist and Bond have drafted legislation that Lott has introduced that bans cloning of
human beings. However, it defines an embryo as a single cell zygote, effectively banning all
cloning experiments with human cells and blocking research that might someday be conducted to
combat diseases such as diabetes and cancer. A number of biotechnology and health groups
have objected to the legislation and are lobbying the Senate. We have met with the staffs of
Senators Frist and Bond to encourage them to reach a compromise that allows for continued
research, and Senators Kennedy and Feinstein have taken the lead with alternative
research-friendly legislation. It seems likely that our best hope of compromise is in the Senate
as the House position may be more intractable and could potentially involve right to life issues.
Our goal is to produce legislation that you could sign. One option may be the addition of a
sunset provision that bans human embryo research for a short time, but allows Congress to revisit
the issue when scientists may actually be ready to take advantage of this technology for human
research. Frist's bill also establishes a new bioethics commission appointed by Congress that
would coexist with the one you set up.
