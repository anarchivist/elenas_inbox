    The Honorable George Voinivich (CHECK SPELLING AND APPROPRIATE TITLES)
    Chair
    The Honorable Thomas Carper
    Vice Chair
    National Governors Association
    444 North Capitol Street
    Washington, D.C. 20001

    Dear Governor Voinivich and Governor Carper:

    In response to your request for clarification about my position to S. 1415, the National Tobacco
    Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act, I am writing to reiterate my strong opposition to
    actions by the Senate to further reduce the State Litigation Settlement Account or impose any
    additional restrictions to it. Since the beginning of the Senate floor debate, I have opposed
    amendments that reduce the original $196.5 billion state allocation that was envisioned in the
    original Attorney Generals' Agreement.

    OPTION 1 for 2nd paragraph:

    It is my firm belief that we would not be having a debate on bipartisan comprehensive legislation
    without the efforts of the states and their attorney generals. As such, I will insist than any
    legislation adequately reflect the important state contributions to reducing the use of tobacco by
    our nation's children. I believe this commitment was illustrated by the joint agreement we
    reached regarding the level and uses of state funds that was included in the original McCain/Lott
    managers agreement. (NGA WANTS A SENTENCE LIKE THIS; ACTUALLY THEY WANT
    A REITERATION OF OUR SUPPORT FOR THE AGREEMENT, BUT I THINK THEY CAN
    LIVE WITH THIS. A difference way of saying same thing that may read a little better is
    outlined below)

    OPTION 2 for 2nd paragraph:

    It is my firm belief that we would not be having a debate on bipartisan comprehensive legislation
    without the efforts of the states and their attorney generals. It is for this reason that we worked
    so hard to reach the agreement that was included in the original McCain/Lott managers
    amendment regarding the level and uses of state funds. While the Senate has amended this
    agreement, you can be assured that I will insist than any final bill adequately reflects the essential
    contributions states have made toward reducing the use of tobacco by our nation's children.

    As experienced lawmaker!', I know you recognize that this bill will go through significant
    changes before final passage. I want to reiterate my strong commitment to working with you in
    the weeks ahead to ensure that a strong, equitable and comprehensive tobacco bill is enacted into
    law.
