Poll: Most support gay rights laws

NEW YORK, Aug. 19 (UPI)   A Harris poll finds a modest 52 percent
majority of American adults favor laws that make it illegal to
discriminate against gays, while 41 percent oppose such laws.

The poll today finds 41 percent prefer Democratic policies on gay
rights and sexual preference, compared to 23 percent who favor
Republican policies.

Pollster Humphrey Taylor says the Christian Coalition and the right
wing of the Republican Party may believe that taking a firm stand
against homosexuality is good politics, but the poll results show
otherwise.

Just more than a third of the 623 adults surveyed say they have close
friends or relatives who are gay. However, those who have gay friends
or relatives are no more likely to support anti-discrimination laws
than those who do not.

The poll finds support for gay rights and anti-discrimination laws
stands at 65 percent among liberals, 54 percent among moderates and 42
percent among conservatives.

Such support is only marginally stronger among Democrats than among
Republicans, at 52 percent to 50 percent.

Fifty-six percent of the women polled support anti-discrimination laws,
compared to 48 percent of men. Sixty-two percent of those from the
Midwest, 58 percent from the East, and 43 percent from the South
support such laws.



    Support for anti-discrimination laws is highly correlated with the
    education of those polled, rising from 34 percent of those who never
    graduated from high school to 62 percent of those with a college
    degree.

    Taylor says the results show that if everyone in the country felt
    strongly about the issue, it would tend to help Democrats and hurt
    Republicans.

    However, the pollster says that for most people, it is not a top-tier
    issue and probably has little impact except among voters who are gay,
    or those who really hate homosexuals.
