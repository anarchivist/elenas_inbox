TEXT:
DOT is getting close to finalizing notice of availability for Access to
Jobs/Reverse Commute grants. One outstanding issue is to what extent
these funds can be used to help people get to work by car.   The Federal
Transit Administration, who has lead responsibility for ATJ is opposed on
several grounds, the main one being they are in the business of getting
people out of cars and into mass transit (there is some indication Fed
Highway Admin. may not agree).  Because ATJ was put in the mass transit
statute, FTA says they are legally prohibited from using funds for single
occupancy vehicles, though car pools and ridesharing are allowed.  While
there are various reasons we might not want to use this money to outright
purchase a car for an individual, we think they could be more flexible if
they wanted to be, and that they should not preclude innovative local
solutions including cars--for example, revolving loan programs,
car-lending arrangements, repair of donated cars. There are interesting
examples like this cropping up around the country; they tend to be small,
and they usually do not involve simply using public funds to buy someone a
car. This is especially important in rural areas, 40% of which do not
have public transit and where it may be more efficient to help someone get
access to a car than to set up a van or shuttle when there may not be
sufficient density of people on similar schedules to fill it up. We do
not imagine car programs will be used on large scale.   We and NEC would
both like to push back for more flexibility for projects who justify why
cars are the most efficient/effective solultion and why other approaches
won't suffice --what do you think?
