TEXT:
1. Chris negotiated with HHS that Peggy Hamburg (new ASPE Assistant
Secretary) will testify with Sally Richardson. Nancy-Ann was allegedly
not available due to other hearings. This isn't too bad, although Peggy
is unknown to the disability community.

2. Josh Gotbaum objected at the last minute to the letter we wanted to
send to Gingrich from the President outlining what we've done in this area
that walked a kind of wormy line on CASA (share the goals, premature to
endorse in full because of questions and complexity, cost is an issue)·.
He believes we should soft-pedal the President's involvement in this issue
because it's such a loser. Chris and I don't agree, but we agreed to drop
it for today because we were having an even bigger argument with Josh ....

3.  Josh initially wanted Peggy/Sally's testimony to explicitly say we
"can't support" CASA because of its huge cost, which would have been a
major problem because no one (Gingrich, Gephardt) is saying that --
everyone is walking the funny line of embracing the goals but neither
endorsing nor opposing it outright -- and we would just be pointlessly
shooting ourselves in the foot for no reason, since the legislation is not
going anywhere anyway. We talked him out of it and agreed on fuzzy
language that doesn't reference CASA specifically, embraces the general
goals, mentions cost as an issue.

The hearing is not technically on CASA, but on home and community-based
services for people with disabilities. HHS's testimony is pretty strong
recounting all the things they are doing in this area. No hostile
questions are expected since the subcommittee is doing this largely
because of pressure from ADAPT.

Anyway, this is OK for today, but Chris and I will continue to push the
Gingrich letter with OMB.  Josh seems pretty hostile to this issue.
