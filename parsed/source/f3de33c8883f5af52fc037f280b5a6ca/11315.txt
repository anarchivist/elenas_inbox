TEXT:
I ran this by Neal Wollin who handles this for Treasury.

Q.   What is the AdministrationD,s response to Senator ThurmondD,s
opposition to the Treasury DepartmentD,s decision to allow two new health
messages on wine bottles and Senator ThurmondD,s announcement that he will
introduce legislation to transfer authority over wine labeling from the
Treasury Department to the Department of Health and Human Services?


A.  The Administration shares Senator ThurmondD,s concern that the public
must not be misled about the effects of alcohol. The consequences of the
misuse of alcohol are grave and we will do all we can to avoid confusion
in the minds of consumers. The Treasury Department did not feel it had
the statutory authority to disapprove these labels given its authority in
this area is limited to prohibiting statements that are false and
misleading. We look forward to examining Senator ThurmondD,s proposal and
working with the Senator and others to investigate appropriate next steps.
