        This is the final draft one-pager for Houston. NEC has cleared it from

                                    DRAFT -- September 24, 1997              Hex-Dwnp Conversion


 MAKING TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE, AND
           PROMOTING A LIFETIME OF LEARNING
President Clinton fought for a Bipartisan Balanced Budget that included a $1,500 HOPE
Scholarship and a Lifetime Learning Tax Credit for middle income families, and a $3,000
maximum Pell Grant scholarship for lower-income families. Today the President will release a
new report which shows how these initiatives will help ensure that anyone can afford tuition and
fees for two years at a community college, and highlights how community colleges are providing
a high-quality education and preparing millions of Americans to participate in the 21st Century
economy. The President will also challenge Congress to follow through on the Balanced
Budget Agreement, not shut the door on thousands of adult students.

Community Colleges are Dynamic Institutions that Provide a High Quality, Affordable Education.
Today the President travels to San Jacinto College, near Houston, to release a new report on community
colleges by the U.S. Department of Education. Fifty years after the Truman Commission Report called
for a nationwide network of public community colleges, this report highlights the critical role being
played by community colleges in preparing the workforce of the 21 st Century. The report describes
how these institutions provide a high quality education to a diverse array of Americans at various stages
in their lives and careers, and underscores that community colleges are remarkably affordable, with
average tuition and fees expected to run just over $1,300 next fall.

The HOPE Scholarship Cuts Tuition and Fee Costs at Community Colleges by 88%. New projections by
the Department of Education indicate that in the 1998-99 school year, the HOPE Scholarship will cover
up to 88 percent of the national average full-time tuition and fees at community colleges. In seven
States, including Texas, HOPE covers 100 percent of community college tuition and fees. In 35 States,
the maximum HOPE Scholarship covers 75 percent or more of tuition and fees. 5.8 million students
are expeded to benefit from the HOPE Scholarship at all types of higher education institutions.

Pell Grants Will Benefit 1.4 Million Community College Students. The Department of Education estimates
that 1.4 million community college students will receive an average Pell Grant in 1998-99 of $1;810.
Pell Grants are available on a sliding scale based on income and can be used to cover tuition and fees as
well as living expenses associated with college. The Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement includes the
President's proposal for the largest increase in the grant in two decades, to a maximum of $3,000. Some
students will qualify for both a Pell Grant and a tax credit (HOPE or Lifetime).

7.1 Million Will Benefit from Lifetime Leaming Tax Credit.   For students beyond their first two years of
college, including those who are returning to school (full or part time) to upgrade their skills or change
careers, the Taxpayers Relief Ad offers a 20 percent tax credit for the first $5,000 of tuition and fees paid
by a student. It is expeded that 7.1 million students will take advantage of the credit to help pay for
postsecondary education.

Many Adults Who Retum to School Will be Shortchanged if Congress Does Not Finish the Job. The
                                   DRAFT ии September 24, 1997 Hex-Dump Conversion

Department of Education estimates that 223,000 students -- and millions more who could consider
college -- will not be able to benefit fully from HOPE or Pell unless the President's budget request for
the Pell Grant program is adopted -- as required by the Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement. The
President's request included a provision to ensure that so-called "independent" students -- those who are
over age 24, or are married or veterans, can receive Pell Grants if they are low-income. (Like other
low-income students, their eligibility for HOPE Scholarships is limited by their tax liability). A
House-Senate conference committee is currently considering this issue. If they do not act to address
this problem, college may be out of reach for students like a 22-year-old veteran making only $10,000 a
year, a married 35-year-old with joint income of only $14,000, or a 30-year-old with income of only
$11,000.
