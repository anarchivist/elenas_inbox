TEXT:
FYI,

I just met with two representatives from Westinghouse about hring welfare
recipients. Westinghouse has several million in contracts with the
Department of Energy and has told Sec. Pena that they want to be one of
the major government contractors to help the Federal government with its
hiring goals.

I gave them a lot of detailed information on how to set up an in-house
program and/or how to use intermediaries.  They are going to come back in
a couple of weeks for comments on a more detailed plan including how to do
it and how many they can hire--and they may work with other large
government contrators to encourage them to do the same.
