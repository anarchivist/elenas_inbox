TEXT:
Attached memo is an effort, triggered by comments, to beef up the Native
Americans chapter of the race book. Developed in consultation with Mary
Smith and Lynn Cutler.

Basic strategy is to get feedback from POTUS before making wholesale
changes in the draft.

Re:    Native American Chapter ofthe Race Book


        As we ride down the home stretch, the question is whether we've done what we should in
the Native American chapter, which was drafted principally by Mary Smith ofDPC. Mary
consulted widely and vetted things quite well. (Terry Edmonds, of course, edited and added some
things.) I'm concerned, however, that the vetting - and especially the review by OMB - have
resulted in something that is simply too tame.

        Don't get me wrong: I'm quite proud of the draft chapter as it stands. The reader will
learn a lot, and the proposed' policy steps are creditable. In particular, they try to avoid the
"over-promising" syndrome so toxic in Indian Country. But as welcome as the analysis and ideas
will be, the proposals don't exactly rock.

        So, I was thinking about giving POTUS something like the attached memorandum along
with the chapter. Please let me know your thoughts, at edley@law.harvard.edu.

       Thanks.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Re:    Native American Opportunity Section of Your Race Book


       Are the policy ideas in this section bold enough? RecaIl that the draft chapter is organized
around Education, Economic Development and Community Security.

       The central rationale for moving along the lines below would be that, while budget
constraints and lack ofHiII support make any near term victory unimaginable, if you don't put
some bold ideas on the table there wiIl never be the kind of conversation which might, over time,
change the political and fiscal constraints that now keep us from making giant strides.

        If you are interested in any or all of these, we wiIl move them forward with the policy
councils. As with most other book ideas, however, if we proceed with these ideas they should be
presented in a long-term framework, so as not to raise expectations of more than a down payment
in the FY 2001 budget.


1. Sovereignty: Build on your government-to-government framework by directing agencies to:

       (a)    systematicaIly inventory all the major grant-in-aid programs serving state or local
              governments and assess whether Tribal governments are included as direct
              recipients of federal funding (as need and capacity warrant);

       (b)    submit recommendations to the White House (OMB) concerning places where
              regulations or statutes should be modified to remove impediments to creating the
              appropriate government-to-government relationship.


2. Education: Build on the One America vision of closing racial disparities by either:

       (a)    state a goal of improving the quality ofBIA schools to at least equal the quality of
              DOD schools, as measured by resource equity and student achievement; or

       (b)    state a goal of improving the quality ofBIA schools to at least equal that of
              state/local public schools in the surrounding region.

        Please note that the costs of eliminating the capital maintenance backlog of BIA schools
is an estimated $1 biIIion. And that is only one item of the equity agenda.

                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion




3. Child Health Disparities: Although Indian country health needs are extraordinarily
compelling, these were a late, post-announcement addition to your disparities initiative last year,
and the illS remains deeply troubled. You could set a national goal of eliminating the disparities
in these five key areas of Native American health care:

        1.     Reduce the rate of diabetes among the Native American population to the national
               average (currently three times the national rate);
        2.     Reducing by 50% the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (currently twice the national
               average);
        3.     Detection, prevention, and screening for breast and cervical cancer in American
               Indian women in order to improve survival rates;
        4.     Reduce the rate of teen suicide in Indian country; and
        5.     Reduce smoking and alcohol abuse.


5.      Economic Development: You could also work to improve economic development in
Indian Country by working with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) to have the
FCC help ensure that geographically isolated tribes receive access to telecommunications
advances to the same extent that other areas of the country do. Chairman Kennard is very
interested in this.
