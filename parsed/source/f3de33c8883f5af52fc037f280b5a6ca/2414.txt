 Maria, Elena,Mike, Joshua:



 Here's where we are and where I'd like to go w.r.t. bold idea working

 groups for the workplan chapter of the book.



  [[MARIA: After reading this, I'd like you to send an email to all addresses
t."                 .
 conveying your sense of the process, the priority you want DPC, NEC and OMB

 to assign to this, and what you want me to do if and when those offices

 decide [as seems inevitable, in my experience] they are too busy to engage.

 I'd like everyone on the same page process-wise. Thanks. ]]



 1.   Working groups in Education, Criminal Justice, Economic Development

 and, sort of, civil Rights Enforcement.        [perhaps additional topiucs later]

 My partners on each topic are, respectively, Elena/Mike on education, Elena

 on crime, Josh on economic development, and Eddie on enforcement.



 2. For the time being, at least, working with me as staff are: Michele

 Cavataio (K-12); Scott Palmer (higher ed, and criminal justice); John

 Goering (economic dev); and Jacinta Ma (civil rights).



 3. Near-term goal is an abbreviated piece of Think Paper with four

 headings:   (a) major Administration accomplishments;      (b) pending

 hot/important policy problems that may need to be addressed before or in

 the book;   (c)   ideas or problems in addition to the above that are "out

 there" that are candidates for discussion in the book, even if there is no

 policy exigency or, even, policy decision           the so-called

 "hard-questions";        (d) bold ideas, including state, local and private

 measures.



 4. CIVIL RIGHTS: I'd like to have initial meetings of these working groups

 ASAP. Eddie is trying to arrange Civil RIghts for Monday around 3:30 pm;

 Jacinta is woriking with him on the Think Paper. I suggest that Mike Cohen

 attend that meeting because of education overlaps.



 5. EDUCATION:          Mike Cohen agreed to organize the Education meeting this

 coming week.      [Not wednesday. I suggest Thursday, any time other than 2pm,


 when Maria has another race mtng· scheduled. Mike·, please invite Eddie, as

 well as Shireman. Invite Josh, but because Josh and Barbara Chow are

 scheduled to be on vacation, Josh wants you to invite Barbara's career

 dputy, Barry White. I concur. I've known him for 20 years. I've asked Scott

 Palmer and Michele Cavataio, working with Mike or his designee, to start on

 the Think Paper.



 6. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: On economic development, Josh is away, but I'll

 work with OMB staff to get the thing started, along with John Goering, so

 that when Josh returns that work group can   get going in high gear. I will

 also ask Sperling who he wants involved.



 7.   CRIMIINAL JUSTICE, ETC.: Elena, will you please take the lead in

 convening a group? I've asked Scott Palmer to start on a THink Paper, but

 it needs DPC input ASAP. Who is Scott's cotact? Jose? Can you please set

 something up this coming week? Again, not Wednesday (I must be in Boston) .



 MY GOAL: is to get some preliminary thinking to POTUS   [and VPOTUS] within a

 couple of weeks, for his quick reaction, to calibrate our boldness, and to

 help us set priorities in further, detailed idea development. Also,

 remember that those few ideas that may have budgetary implications will

 have to feed into that process.



 Thanks one and all.
