TEXT:
OMB has asked by 5:00 today for clearance of the following short and
simple statement of administration position on the technicals bill:

"The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1048, which will help
ensure the effective implementation of the Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996."
This seems accurate.
