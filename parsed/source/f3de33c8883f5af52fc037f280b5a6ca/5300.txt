FDA Reform. On Friday you are signing the FDA refonn bill. This legislation reauthorizes the
very successful user fee program which provides the additional funding for the FDA that has
enabled it to approve new drugs as fast or faster than any other nation in the world. This bill
also codifies the REGO reforms that the Vice President successfully implemented at FDA in
1995 and 1996. The industry felt strongly that this was necessary because they continue to
believe that there is an anti-industry bias at FDA and that in the absence of statutory authority,
the reforms, which provide for more agency accountability, could back track. This legislation has
been significantly altered to delete many of the more egregious provisions in the legislation that
the consumer advocacy community was extremely concemed about. We worked closely with
Senator Kennedy's office to ensure this was the case and, in the end, hewas happy be the 100th
vote in a unanimous vote of support for this legislation.


Also addition to the Quality Commission insert
On Tuesday, Journal American Medical Association (JAMA) is briefing the National Press Club
announcing that their upcoming issue is dedicated entirely to concerns about health care quality.
This briefing will no doubt further amplify media interest in the Commission's consumer bill of
rights. With this in mind, we have invited the JAMA board to brief the Vice President along
with the co-chairs of the Commission, Secretary Shalala and Secretary Herman, to highlight the
Administration's interest in this issue and to build up your acceptance of consumer bill of rights
on Thursday.
