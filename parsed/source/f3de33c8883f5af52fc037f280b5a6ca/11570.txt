     Here's on more crime bill provision:

     Pension Fraud. The President's new crime bill makes it a federal crime to
     defraud an employee pension benefit or retirement plan.  It increases the
     penalty for embezzlement from such plans from 5 to 10 years imprisonment,
     as well as for bribery (3 to 10 years) and graft (3 to 5 years) associated
     with the operation of pension and retirement plans.

     Tom:

     As requested by you/Bruce earlier today, below please find brief, if not
     perfect, descriptions of the new white collar crime and chem-bio
     provisions in our crime bill. We have some other things that may not end
     up in the bill, so I haven't incorporated them here. Also, we have a huge
     money laundering package that I can't even begin to characterize in any
     simple/short way, though you may want to consider including a sentence on
     releasing a national strategy to crack down on money laundering.


     Health Care Fraud.  The President's new crime bill proposes cracking down
     on health care fraud by:


 (1) Increasing from 5 to 10 years the maximum penalty for obstructing a
 health care fraud investigation or providing false statements in relation
 to health care matters;

 (2) Cracking down on illegal kickb'ack schemes in the health care industry
 by extending the current penalties that apply to federally funded health
 plans to all private health insurance providers; and

 (3) Strengthening the ability of federal prosecutors to investigate and
 bring civil health care fraud cases.


 Telemarketing Fraud.  The President's new crime bill strengthens our
 efforts against telemarketing fraud by authorizing federal law enforcement
 authorities to block or terminate telephone service to anyone engaged in
 telemarketing fraud (just as they currently can with persons engaged in
 illegal gambling).


 Environmental Crimes,  The President's new crime bill includes tough new
 provisions to crack down on environmental crimes, including:

 (1) Authorizing federal courts to order convicted criminals to reimburse
 states and localities for the costs of prosecuting environmental crimes
 (this should help foster joint federal, state, and local prosecutions of
 these crimes) .

 (2) Enhancing penalties for environmental crimes that result in serious
 bodily injury or death to any person -- including police, firefighters,
 paramedics, and other public safety and health personnel who are often the
 first on the scene of an environmental crime;

 (3) Extending the statute of limitations up to 3 more years (to a total of
 8 years) for environmental criminals who act to conceal their crimes;

 (4) Punishing attempted environmental crimes the same as those crimes
 actually committed (This allows law enforcement authorities to intervene
 before lives are lost or damage is done to the environment);

 (5) Guaranteeing that victims of environmental crimes -- including, in
 some instances, whole communities -- are eligible for restitution.


 Expansion of Biological Weapons Statute.  The President's new crime bill
 expands and updates our laws against biological weapons, including by:

 (1) Establishing a 10-year penalty for any person that knowingly possesses
 a biological weapon (agent, toxin, or delivery system), and making the use
 of a biological weapon that results in death an offense punishable by
 death;

 (2) Making it a crime to falsely report that someone possesses a
 biological weapon; and

 (3) Requiring that the possession of certain biological agents and toxins
 be reported to HHS within a specified time period, and establishing civil
 and criminal penalties for failing to report. to HHS or to comply with
 regulations is issues on the transfer and possession of these agents,
