Did Shelly suggest that she had been e-mailing me? I haven't receved anything
from her.  There are two Kathy Wallman's; perhaps she has gotten my mail, but
she's very good about forwarding it.
On the substance, I don't know anything about the matter. You might bring it up
at the staff meeting tomorrow and we can ask about how to proceed. Perhaps Lois
is the right person to contact.  Since it's a specific matter, I think we need
to call Schmidt first.
