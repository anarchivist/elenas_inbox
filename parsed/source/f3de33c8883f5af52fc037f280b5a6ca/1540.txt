TEXT:
Teen Pregnancy -- We wouldn't get any news coverage if he speaks at a
dinner, but I think if they're doing a Congressional press conference we
should have them come to the WH for a meeting. We should have the pool in
the room for the President's statement, though.  Would that be ok?

DLC --.sounds great. Should we put in a scheduling proposal to get some
tentative dates? Is it pretty certain they are going to be doing their
meeting in May?
