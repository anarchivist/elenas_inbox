TEXT:
I am setting up the meeting you requested with the religious
organizations on the "charitable choice" issue.  I don't know whom
to invite other than us and Wendy White of counsel's office ... no
one else seems relevant.
I think I get this issue, but want to double check my
understanding with yours -- unless of course you don't know the
issue yet yourself.  The welfare law explicitly lets religious
organizations give people TANF services. However, our technical
correction package proposes an amendment to make sure the law
reflects the Supreme Court's ruling that "pervasively sectarian"
organizations CAN'T administer publicly funded programs. And I
assume the groups are worried that our technical correction went
too far?? Let me know if this seems wrong.
