TEXT:
We are ready to go.  Paper is done, groups are fine, etc.   We are looking
for some support in the law enforcement community too.

A thought about whether we should do this as a leak or in the State of the
Union.  I think if the President talks about this in the State of the
Union it will be much more difficult to get this done in appropriations.
I think I'd therefore prefer a leak. Also, next week is the anniversary
of Roe v. Wade, and I think this becomes more of an abortion message and
less of a "domestic terrorism" issue if we do it during that week.  Any
new thoughts about who we would give this to if we leak it?
