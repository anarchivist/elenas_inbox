Subject: Re: Ken on 7:45 and releasing disability work incentives today

Message Creation Date was at   5-FEB-1997 11:13:00

There was NO decision on it at the 7:45 yesterday.  Frank brought it up, I

it was a good idea to release, and that's all that was said.  We're not
talking
about SSA announcing, we're talking about Chris or Melissa giving a
reporter a
heads-up
