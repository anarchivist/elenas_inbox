TEXT:
Jonathan Orszag said these are the plans re: the Census data on Monday:

If it is good news -- which is what we expect -- we will put out a
five-page packet with the best facts, charts, etc.  The POTUS will also do
a departure statement and then Gene, Yellen, Rubin, and Daley will brief
in the press room.
