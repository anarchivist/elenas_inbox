                                          August 2, 1997


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Re.port




       1. Welfare Reform: Welfare Reform and the Budget -       The headline in Friday's New
York Times sums it up nicely: "In Budget Bill, President Wins Welfare Battle." As the article
notes, you pledged last August when you signed the bill to "change what is wrong" and in this
bill you "won major concessions in blunting some of the welfare law's toughest provisions."
Even Robert Rector conceded to Robert Pear on Tuesday "the Republicans appear to have
capitulated on almost every welfare issue."

        The final bill guarantees health and disability payments to all poor legal immigrants in the
U.S. by last August, restoring benefits to those now receiving them and guaranteeing assistance
to those who become disabled in the future. This restores approximately half of the welfare
law's benefit cuts to legal immigrants. The bill includes your $3 billion welfare to work
proposal, which provides funds for job creation and placement to cities and other high poverty
areas through the Department of Labor's Private Industry Councils. The funds are targeted to
long-term welfare recipients; they can also be used to find jobs for non-custodial parents, when
their children's custodial parent is a long-term recipient.

        The welfare to work tax credit is similar, though slightly less generous, than the one you
proposed: rather than giving companies who hire long-term recipients a credit for 50% of wages
up to $10,000 for each of two years, the final bill gives a 35% credit for the first year and a 50%
credit for the second year. The bill also provides $1.5 billion to fund additional work slots for
working-age, childless individuals who will lose Food Stamps if they don't work 20 hours a
week, less than the $4.8 billion you requested for work slots and other benefit restorations. The
bill also continues Medicaid coverage for children who lose SSI under the new welfare law
because of the stricter definition of childhood disability, another Administration proposal.

        In the negotiations we also successfully thwarted Republican attempts to add anti-labor
riders to the bill. The provision to allow Texas and possibly other states to completely privatize
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

Medicaid and Food Stamp operations was dropped (rumor has it that Gov. Bush said no to the
only offer we could accept -- allow a substate demonstration in one state which would cover no
more than half the recipients -- because he'd rather have an issue than a substate program). And,
in one of the last issues to close in the negotiations, we eliminated the GOP provisions to exempt
workfare recipients from the Fair Labor Standards Act and other worker protections.

        In the final discussions, we had offered to exempt workfare recipients from FICA payroll
taxes and the EITC in exchange for some limits on workfare and remedies for gender
discrimination that the House Democrats were eager to include. While this deal was not
included in the final bill, the EITC exclusion was included in exchange for improvements to the
child tax credit. In the meantime, the Republicans have made clear that they intend to re-open
the Fair Labor Standards Act issues in September, perhaps in the appropriations context.

       2. Welfare Reform: Proposed High Performance Bonus -- You asked whether we like the
proposed formula to distribute the $1 billion in the welfare law for high performance bonuses to
states. The short answer is yes; here's why. The welfare law, as you know, measures states on
"work participation" which includes individuals in training, job search, and education as well as
those combining work and welfare. The "work participation" measure only indirectly captures
those who have left welfare altogether for work, by giving states credit for caseload reduction
(i.e., a state whose caseload has gone down 20 will have to meet a 30 work participation rate
in the year 2002 rather than a 50 one). The high performance bonus gives us an opportunity
to judge states on real outcomes related to real work. The proposal now under discussion
between HHS, NGA, and APWA would reward states with bonuses whose programs result in
high rates of leaving welfare for work, retaining jobs, and improving earnings. It would also
give bonuses to those who succeed in critically important task of reducing teen births. HHS
and the state representatives seem to agree that these are the right kinds of performance to
reward; they still disagree over which data should be used to measure employment and wages
(states want to use their welfare agency records, while HHS wants them to rely on the more
objective state unemployment insurance data which employers report). All in all, this bonus will
enable us to collect data to hold states publicly accountable for their performance on what really
matters.

        3. Education: National Testing Initiative - The Labor-HHS appropriations bill had
been scheduled for consideration in the House earlier this week; it is now likely to come up in
September soon after the Congress returns. Mr_ Goodling has an amendment he is intending to
offer that would prohibit the Education Department from spending any FY 1998 funds on the
development or administration of national tests. If the vote had been held this week, there is a
chancet we would have lost. While Democratic support was generally strong (with the
exception of the Hispanic Caucus, discussed below), Republican support was not, and began to
erode as the expected debate approached.




                                                2
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion       ·
        For example, Frank Riggs has been a supporter of the tests but was planning to support
his chairman, Mr. Goodling. Mr. Porter is one of our strongest supporters, and has consistently
indicated his oppostion to the Goodling amendment. He has prepared a substitute amendment
that would permit the Education Department to continue to develop the tests, though prohibit
using FY 1998 funds for test administration. Since we were never planning to administer the
test until FY 1999, this would have no impact on our ability to move forward.

        Right wing groups, home schoolers, Lynn Cheney and others have been lobbying hard in
support of Goodling's amendment, with some impact. For example, Mr. Livingston,
originally allied with his subcommittee chair, Mr. Porter, shifted his position in favor of the
Goodling amendment, apparently the result of right wing pressure from his district.

       We have begun to mobilize supporters of the testing initiative to contact their members
during the recess. AFT, NEA, BRT, NAB, the Chief State School Officers, the Council of
Great City Schools, and other education groups are working together to activate their members to
encourage House members to oppose efforts to stop development of the tests.

        The Hispanic Caucus has indicated that it might vote en bloc with Mr. Goodling. The
caucus has been very concemed with our policy of providing the 4th grade reading test only in
English; they believe this approach will either exclude too many Hispanic students who may not
have had sufficient time to learn English, or will force them to take tests they are not yet prepared
for. They have asked for a commitment to create a Spanish language version of the test that
students with limited English proficiency could take instead. We have been exploring ways of
addressing their concerns, while maintaining our position that students should be expected to
read in English and be tested in English. The Caucus has indicated that, if it is not satisfied with
our final position on this issue, it is prepared to support Goodling's amendment. We have
promised the Caucus that we will continue to consult with them over the next several weeks.
We will have a decision memo for you before the end of August on this issue.

         At the NGA meeting, Secretary Riley met with the DGA and with a number of governors
of both parties on the testing issue. There were no breakthroughs at the meeting, nor new
commitments to participate in the tests. However, the discussions ultimately were positive.
Some 11 Democratic governors have pledged to send you letters of endorsement for the testing
initiative. A number of governors in both parties (e.g., Dean, Geringer) appear to be inching
toward participation, while others continue to face obstacles. For example, Gov. Romer has
been unable to secure the support of his elected State Board of Education, and instead will be
encouraging local school districts to sign up on their own.
