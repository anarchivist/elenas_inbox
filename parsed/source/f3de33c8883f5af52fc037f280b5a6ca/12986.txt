        Reno Says House Weakening Gun Bill

                              Friday, June 11, 1999; 11:50 a.m. EDT

                              WASHINGTON (AP)    -- Attorney General Janet Reno said
        today the
                              House has "undermined"      a Senate gun control bill
        designed to stop
                              criminals from making weapons purchases at gun shows.

                              At a weekly meeting with reporters, Reno said the House
        bill narrows the
                              definition of "gun show"     and would cut down the time
        police have to
                              complete background checks of prospective gun buyers who
        attend the
                              events.

                              The House bill, to be taken up Wednesday, will not cover
        many places
                              such as flea markets where guns are often sold.

                          " I t doesn't matter to criminals if the event is called
        a gun show or a flea
                          market -- if they can buy guns"   without a background
        check, "they will
                          come, " Reno said.

                        " I was very disappointed to see that"  the House bill
       "has undermined the
                        common-sense measures passed by the Senate to close the
       gun show
                        loophole, " the attorney general said.

                              Under legislation passed by the Senate last month, gun
        shows are broadly


                        defined as events where a large number of guns are sold.
    The Senate bill
                        extends the Brady law to gun shows, giving police three
    business days to
                        complete background checks. The House bill changes the
    deadline for
                        completing the checks to 72 hours, a crucial difference
    because gun
                        shows usually are held on weekends. Record checks of
    courthouse files                             too
                        are impossible on weekends and are the only way to
    conclusively
                      determine whether a person with an arrest record has
    been convicted of a
                      crime.

                        Congressional Democrats and President Clinton complain
    that the
                      National Rifle Association is writing the House's gun
    control bill, while
                      Republicans dispute that.

                      The House is taking its turn at cracking down on
    juvenile violence two
                      months after two high school students in Littleton,
    Colo., murdered 12 of
                      their classmates and a teacher before killing
    themselves.
