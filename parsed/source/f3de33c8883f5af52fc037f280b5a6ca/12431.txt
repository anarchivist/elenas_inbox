TEXT:
EEOC has been working on new regulations for over a year which would
streamline and make fairer the process by which federal employees pursue
discrimination complaints.  This process has been a very contentious one
with many of the agencies voicing objections. The main issue is that
under the current system, the agencies issue a "final decision" from which
the employee can appeal. However, EEOC wanted to change this because one
of the parties in interest (the agency-defendant) acted as its own judge
and jury, making the process seem unfair.   Under the proposed rule, the
EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) would issue a decision, and the agency
would only have a short period of time to accept or reject it.   The final
rule is almost ready to be published, barring any last minute objections
by the agencies. OMB is planning on asking for final comments from the.
agencies next week.

NPR is starting a related process which would try to reduce the backlog of
federal employees' complaints pending at each agency (in addition to what
the above rule might accomplish).   NPR plans on announcing this Task
Force at the PMC Meeting on May 5. Moreley really wants to announce the
NPR Task Force next week.

The issue is that some of the agencies may view the NPR process as the
Administration as backing away from the rule and that the agencies might
use the PMC meeting to derail the final rule process.   While the final
stages of the rule process may be contentious, it might actually be
beneficial to voice strong WH support for the rule at the PMC meeting.
Thus, the PMC meeting could actually help, rather than hinder, the final
stage of the rule process.  Does this seem like a good strategy?
