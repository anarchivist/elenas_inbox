TEXT:
        Scheduling/Communications is holding August 15th and September 8th
(POTUS' first day back from vacation) for Back to School events. They
would like us come up with something for one of those days .. The Radio
Address being taped on Sept. 5th is another option.
        Right now, there is still a possibility that the next race
advisory board meeting will be held on Aug. 15th.   If that does get
confirmed for the 15th than the education event would definitely be in
September. Also, if they do the race meeting they would like to do
something on racial disparities in health care.   Please let me know if any
of this seems particularly problematic right now -- more than the usual!
Thanks.
