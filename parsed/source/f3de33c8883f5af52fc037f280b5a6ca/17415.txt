TEXT:
I have two requests (please):

*Elena and Chris meet with Chiles lawyers BEFORE any letter goes out to
states (as Chiles staff is saying Bruce promised to Chiles on Friday night)

*Bruce meet with Rayon tobacco.   This is instead of a larger briefing
with all Governors, which NGA is willing to hold off on until the winter.
This is Ray's request.

Thanks.
