TEXT:
You had asked me to respond to the President's question from the Weekly
Cabinet Report about whether we can expand the partnership between the
CDC and WIC to increase immunization rates.  The program has already been
expanded to all states. The FY 1996 appropriation to CDC directed them to
ensure that all states reserve at least 10% of their infrastructure funds
for linkage with WIC, unless the state could document that a linkage was
already occurring.  In 1997, $14.7 million is being spent on formal WIC/
immunization linkages in all states.
