You were inadvertently left off this as well. Sorry about that. Last
night, we had a close vote (49-51) in the Senate on an attempt to allow
military women to use their own money in order to have abortions in
military hospitals overseas. This is the season ...

MEMORANDUM

To: Democratic Pro-Choice & Health Staff
From: Clare Coleman/Rep. Lowey -- Pro-Choice Task Force
Date: May 25, 1999
Re: Floor fights ahead: DOD authorization; Ag & TP Appropriations


Yesterday, you received from the PCTF an email alerting you to the
possibility of anti-choice action in the Agriculture Appropriations bill,
which should hit the floor today.  Here's what else may be ahead this week:

DOD Authorization: The DOD Authorization bill is scheduled for floor
consideration on Thursday, May 27, although the House may not get to it
this
week.

Loretta Sanchez is carrying the amendment (which is the past has been
sponsored by former Reps. Jane Harman and Pat Schroeder) to allow military
women and dependents stationed overseas to use their own money to pay for
an
abortion in an overseas military facility.

Rep. Sanchez won a major victory in subcommittee, when her amendment to
allow privately-funded abortions won by two votes.  However, her provision
was stripped during full Armed Services Committee consideration last week.
Rep. Sanchez will attempt to restore access to privately-funded abortions
in
military facilities overseas during floor consideration of the DOD
Authorization bill.

It is also important for you to know that an exception for rape and incest
has been added to the current DOD policy of paying for abortions only in
the
case of life endangerment. This change aligns DOD policy with the Hyde
Amendment (which limits federal payment for abortion under Medicaid,
Medicare, and CHIP to cases of rape, incest and life endangerment) & every
other federal abortion restriction except the restriction affecting women
in
the federal prison system (where payment is restricted to cases of rape and
life endangerment only) .



Attached to the life, rape and incest exception is a requirement that women
who are victims of "forcible" rape or incest report the assault to a law
enforcement agency in order for their abortion to be federally-qualifieo
for
payment. Discussions are underway to remove this provision, which would
only impose more burden and humiliation on a woman who has been assaulted,
when the DOD authorization moves to conference.

Treasury Postal Appropriations:.  Full Committee mark-up of the FY 2000
Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill was cancelled last week due to the
impending fight over gun control.  It is likely that the Appropriations
Committee will postpone mark-up of the bill until after Memorial Day
recess.

The subcommittee mark includes the prohibition on Federal Employees Health
Benefit (FEHB) coverage of abortion (exceptions: rape, incest, life
endangerment). There is an attempt to strike this provision every year,
and
unfortunately, the strike fails every year.  Rep. DeLauro is expected to
offer an amendment to strike the restriction in committee.

The subcommittee mark also contains the Lowey contraceptive coverage
provision, requiring FEHB plans to cover prescription contraceptive drugs
and devices if they cover other prescriptions.  It is likely that an
anti-choice member will attempt to strike the Lowey provision in committee
or on the floor -- we expect to win that.  Again, Treasury-Postal
Appropriations is still in committee and is unlikely to make to the floor
before Memorial Day recess.
