TEXT:
BR/EK:

Per Elena's suggestion I checked w/Jen Klein on the "sensitivity" of not
doing the CDF meeting tomorrow morning.   Jen wasn't concerned and didn't
think it was a big deal not to do it.   But as I was going to call CDF and
regret, I heard from Michelle Crisci that Marian had continued to call
EB's office and complained, and, thus, Michelle was going to set-up a
meeting for tomorrow at about 11am. The meeting would be w/CDF, some
40-50 local civil rights and religious leaders, Rahm and Bruce, and EB
making a stop-by.

Bruce, Cathy said you probably won't go, so I'll assume I should be there
to help out Rahm on any matters of substance.  EK, would you like to
attend? I'll send you both the final time and place of the meeting as
soon as I get confirmation from Michelle.

Jose'
