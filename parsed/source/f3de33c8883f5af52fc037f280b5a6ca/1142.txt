TEXT:
I disagree.  It is not loaded with fat cat contributors.  It does have
representatives from health care interests (like doctors, nurses,
hospitals, health insurers and managed care plans, consumers, unions,
quality experts, etc.), but the executive order appropriately requires
their participation and they are quality people. Out of the 32 members, I
would say there are only 2-5 that could be categorized as big time
contributors. The others have long and distinguished careers in the
quality/health care front and there is no question that their membership
will be validated by respected outsiders.  (Even then, the three have a
background and interest in health care that justifies their existence.)

If you would like to go over the list, I would be happy to do so. I
believe if you asked Doug, he could come up with only a couple of names he
thinks a fat cats. Let's talk, but I do not think this will be a problem,
and'of course will do everything in my power to assure that the
announcement gets a positive lift-off from the outside validators.
