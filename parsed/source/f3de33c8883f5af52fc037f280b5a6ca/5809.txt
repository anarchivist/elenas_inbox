TEXT:
Josh Gotbaum asked that I forward the attached E-mail to you re: FDA & CDC
food safety funding.

As noted in the attachment, HHS was provided an additional $25 million
over the FY 1998 enacted level of $24 million for FDA food safety
activities. HHS was advised that the additional $25 million was to be
used to meet the President's food safety commitments.

HHS instructed FDA to use $5 million of the $25 million for import
inspection and the balance for domestic food safety activities. We spoke
to HHS staff and advised them that $5 million was not sufficient for
import inspection and that a greater portion of the $25 million was to be
dedicated to international import inspection. We will keep you updated if
there are further developments ...... .

Subject:         FDA & CDC Funding for Food Safety Activities

You asked that we provide you with an assessment of the OSTP staff


complaint that FDA and CDC have not been provided enough funding to meet
the Administration's stated goals in the President's Food Safety
Initiative.

FDA's Food Safety Import Funding Level

        The passback for FDA included $24 million in FDA's base to
continue food safety initiative activities begun in FY 1998 and an
additional $25 million to fund food import inspection activities and some
expanded domestic food safety activities, for a total food safety
initiative level of $49 million.

        When we passed back the $25 million for FDA (we also passed back
$5 million for CDC food safety), we advised HHS that this was all the
additional funding they would be getting to cover additional FDA food
safety initiative activities and the President's food safety commitments.
We did not passback a split for domestic and international food safety and
left it to HHS' judgment, assuming that HHS would allocate the funds to
meet the President's most recent import inspection commitment.

        In previous discussions with FDA, we determined that FDA could
reasonably obligate in FY 1999 at least $15 million to develop a
comprehensive international import inspection program and hire over 60
international import inspectors (FDA currently has roughly four FTEs doing
international inspection). With such an increase,   FDA will be able to
evaluate/investigate the food safety systems of 50 to 55 countries phased
in over two years.

HHS Advised FDA to Spend Less on Imports

        Instead of adequately funding the food import inspection
initiative tc> meet the President's commitment to "dramatically expanding-"
FDA's food import inspections, HHS apparently advised FDA that of the $25
million we passed back, $20 million was for domestic food safety and $5
million for the President's Food Import inspection initiative.

        We spoke to Bill Beldon today at ASMB and advised him that the HHS
split for domestic and food import was not sufficient to meet the
President's commitment for food import inspections and that FDA would need
at least $15 million, although we were not precluding HHS from allocating
more than $15 million to import inspections of the total $25 million
passed back for food safety.  Bill acknowledged our concern and said he
would communicate this concern to the rest of ASMB and FDA.

        It is our considered judgment that the additional $25 million
(+20% over the FY 1998 enacted level for FDA food safety activities) that
was passed back to FDA will be enough to meet the Administration's
commitments on food safety in FY 1999, but the funds need to be allocated
according to Administration priorities i.e., the majority of the $25
million should go to -import inspection.




Analysis of OSTP Concern Re: CDC Food Safety Funding

        In the attached e-mail OSTP staff states that "$5 million would
not enable CDC to put in place the early warning system the President


promised last January." We assume OSTP is referring to the "Food Safety:
From Farm to Table" initiative announced to support the FY 1998 Budget.
If this is the case, the statement is not accurate.

         The Food Safety initiative announced by the President last
January (and subsequently summarized in. a May 1997 report prepared by EPA,
HHS and USDA) outlined specific policies and resource levels for FY 1998.
While the interagency report identified some "long-term" activities, it
did not identify specific resource levels for FY 1999 or other out years.
Specifically, the initiative proposed an additional $10 million for CDC in
FY 1998 (a 222% increase) over FY 1997 to expand from five to eight the
number of "Foodnet" active surveillance sentinel sites that conduct
epidemiological research on foodborne pathogens, as well as expand the use
of molecular "finger-printing" technology to identify the source of infect
ious agents.

congress enacted the resources proposed in the FY 1998 Food Safety
initiative for CDC. The OMB.recommended level for FY 1999 is a $5 million
(+34%) increase over the level proposed by the President in FY 1998 for
CDC, but lower than the $21 million (+145%) increase requested by HHS for
FY 1999. The OMB recommendation would allow CDC to build upon the
activities that CDC will conduct in FY 1998, although not to the level
that HHS would like. HHS is appealing for an additional $5 million over
the OMB recommendation in FY 1999.
