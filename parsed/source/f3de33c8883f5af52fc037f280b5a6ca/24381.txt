S. 1301 - Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998
(Grassley (R) Iowa and Sen. Durbin (D) Illinois)

The Administration supports bankruptcy reform that asks responsibility of
debtors and creditors alike. Debtors who genuinely have the ability to
repay a portion of their debts should remain responsible for those debts.
But creditors must also be responsible in their treatment of debtors,
recognizing the inherent inequality of information and bargaining power
that the two possess.

As initially reported from committee, S. 1301 focused primarily on
purported debtor abuse, with little to curtail abuses by creditors.
However, if changes incorporated in the managersD, package of amendments
are adopted, the Senate bill will take significant steps to address
abusive practices by both debtors and creditors.  Essential changes
include new disclosure requirements to ensure that credit card companies
provide consumers with the information about their accounts that they need
to manage their budgets and procedural protections to avoid inappropriate
and unwise reaffirmations of unsecured and certain secured consumer
debts. We particularly appreciate modifications made to the
nondischargeability provisions in the bill so that the bill no longer in
appropriately puts credit card debt in competition with child support,
alimony, and other societal priorities like educational loans and taxes.

The Administration also prefers the discretionary approach to limiting
access to Chapter 7 used in S. 1301 over the rigid and arbitrary approach
in the House bill. We appreciate changes made by the Senate bill to
ensure that those debtors denied access to Chapter 7 under Section 707(b}
of the Bankruptcy Code are those that have a strong likelihood of success
under a Chapter 13 plan.

More can and should be done to produce a truly balanced bill. We must
address the potentially coercive effect of allowing creditors to bring
707(b} motions for any reason, improve consumer understanding of the
effect of granting security interests, and ensure that the protections
against coercive reaffirmations are effective.

The Administration would support passage of S. 1301, if it is further
amended in conference to improve the balance between reforms targeting
debtors and reforms targeting creditors, and if the essential reforms
incorporated by the managersD, package of amendments are preserved.



The Administration also SUpports financial contract netting provisions in
the bill that are important to reducing systematic risk in our financial
markets.



Finally, the Senate will vote on an amendment to raise wages of 12 million
Americans and help ensure that parents who work hard and play by the rules
do not have to raise their children in poverty.  Two years ago, the
President signed into law a similar moderate increase in the minimum
wage.  The results of that action are clear: it raised wages and did not
cost jobs. Now we must continue to take actions to ensure that all
Americans are benefitting from our prospering economy.  That is why the
Administration strongly supports raising the minimum wage by $1 over two
years.
