  TEXT:
  As you well know, the timber rider requires the release of all of
  the old growth sales unless t or e birds are "known to be nesting"
  in the sale unit.
  Today, a local enviro group sent a letter regarding the Rocky
  Brook timber sale on the Olympic National Forest, along with three
  affidavits from members who state that they believe they heard
  "the call of a Northern spotted owl" in the sale unit between Feb.
  15 - March 9th. On the basis of those affidavits, they ask that
  the Forest Service hold up the purchasers' harvest of the sale
  until there is an independent survey for spotted owls.
  If they don't get an affirmative answer today, they said they
  would file for a TRO tommorrow.  Justice is getting some press
  calls .
. This is the sale in Norm Dicks' district that was the subject of a
  protest last week.  It has been harvested for the past several
  weeks, and there are about 2-3 weeks left to go.  None of the
  affdavits are from biologists. The Forest Service district
  wildlife biologist did an.evaluation of the unit on January of
  1989 and stated that "All proposed units are considered suitable
  spotted owl habitat", but there is no agency evidence of nesting


in the unit.
Surveys for spotted owls take about 2 months, and apparently it's
a bit early in the season to even start that clock running.
The Justice lawyers do not believe there are legal grounds to
order the purchasers to stop harvesting.  Their suggested approach
would be to have the Forest Service conduct its own examination
during the evening for a few nights to see if they believe there
is any new evidence warranting a survey, but not requesting the
harvester to cease operations. The Forest Service doesn't even
want to do that much; they want to blast the credentials of the
enviros who signed the affadavits and not send anyone out.
Of course, Justice needs an answer NOW.  Elena is running this by
Jennifer. We've told DOJ we'd try to get them an answer by around
lOish tommorow morning.

I think Justice's approach makes sense in terms of the timber
rider requirements and common sense. While I'd like to give the
owls the benefit of the doubt, I have to admit these particular
affidavits are not impressive. On the other hand, I think not
sending anyone out to do any checking is irresponsible. And,
given the events of the day and the publicity surrounding this
sale, I didn't want to preclude the chance that you might have a
different view of how to handle this.
