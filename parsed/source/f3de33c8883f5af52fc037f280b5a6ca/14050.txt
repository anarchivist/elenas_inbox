I left a message on your voice system. The Justice attorney who
is the coordinating the letter is Adrien Silas and he can be
reached at 514-7276.
At this point, we are not certain that the letter will be cleared
or if there will be major revisions to it.  HUD has expressed
serious concerns with the timing of the letter and some of the
positions that Justice is taking. We are waiting for Justice and
HUD to talk directly regarding HUD's concerns.  (Hopefully, this
will occur today.)
The timing of the bill is still uncertain.  However, I did talk to
a staffer today who thought the Conferees may meet officially
during the middle of next week.
Please call me to discuss the nature of your concerns with the
Justice letter.
Thanks. Anna
