TEXT:
As you know, NGA is working on tobacco policy that Govs will vote on at
the Winter meeting.  Currently, the fight between R's and D's is over how
to spend the money that is rightfully theirs, not ours (they oppose all
negotiations on recoupment). R's want to say spend the money generally on
health and wellbeing. D's want to say spend the money on health and
welfare related programs, and are willling to add education to that as a
fallback.

Last night R Govs had a conference call with Lott and Gingrich to talk
about tobacco.  Govs noticed a real shift in the way they were
talking--from don't worry a deal won't happen to something will happen,
but not sure about scope.  Lott and Gingrich did say that they wanted to
bring all Govs in to talk about their views (not helpful for us at all) .
