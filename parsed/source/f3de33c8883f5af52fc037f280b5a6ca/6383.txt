TEXT:
DOL will be ready by week's end to approve state welfare to work plans for
South Carolina (about $12 million) and Massachusetts ($20 million).  I'm
getting one page descriptions, but am told there's nothing notable here.
While I hate to let them go, I can't see what we can do with them.  Any
thoughts? I left word with the VP's office -- if he happened to be
traveling there they would make good local annoucements. Are we doing
regional newspaper leaks these days?
