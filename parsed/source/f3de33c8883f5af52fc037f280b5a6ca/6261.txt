               TEXT:
               I commend you on your,introduction of S. 1602 the O&Prohibition on Cloning
               of Human Beings Act of 1998.08 If enacted, this bill would prohibit any
               attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer,
               provide ~or further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated
               with the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer, and protect important
               biomedical research.  The bill, which closely parallels the bill I
               submitted last June, also follows the findings and recommendations
               presented to me by my National Bioethics Advisory Commission. I said then
               and reaffirmed this belief in my January 10 radio address that using
               somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning techniques to clone a human being is
               untested, unsafe, and morally unacceptable.  I called on congress to enact
               legislation making it illegal for anyone to clone a human being at this
               time.  I am pleased to see your response to my challenge.

               Trying to draft a bill that walks the fine line between defining the
.'
 unacceptable act of producing a child that is the genetic replica of
 another person, while protecting biomedical and agricultural research is a
 formidable task. My bill offered one way to achieve those dual goals;
 your bill clearly reaches for the same result.  In this case, imprecise
 wording carries the threat of impeding research that might one day offer
 hope to those suffering from spinal cord injury, ParkinsonD,s disease,
 diabetes or AIDS. We must not make such a mistake in our haste to close
 the doors to those who would subvert this promising new technology by
 using it for unethical purposes.

 I am also pleased that you have heeded my proposal to put a time limit on
 this prohibition.  The sunset provision ensures a continuing examination
 of the risks and benefits of this technology, while we are free from worry
 that someone will use it prematurely.

 Society shouldnD,t make decisions about the application of a specific
 technology without first understanding its full potential, both good and
 bad. Asking the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to return to this
 complex issue in four and one-half years will promote a deeper awareness
 of the power we hold to alleviate the burden of human illness and a
 broader debate on the ethical and moral limits we ought to impose on
 exercising that power. We are not ready to answer these enormously
 challenging questions today.

 That is why we must act now to reassure the public that this government
 will not tolerate anyone using somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a
 child.  I thank you for your efforts on behalf of the American people and
 look forward to signing this bill.
