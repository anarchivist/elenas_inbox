TEXT:
How's this for crimes against seniors:

              Crackdown on Crimes Against Seniors

    Give law enforcement officials additional tools to prosecute criminals
who target seniors · such as telemarketing fraud and health care · and
strengthen penalties for criminal behavior that harms seniors physically
and financially.

(this is based on langage from Leahy)
