TEXT:
The conference call tomorrow on the DOJ church plan/securities laws exemption
letter will be at 3:30. Call 456-6777, code 5792. Don't call early, and don't
hang up once you call.  If you want others on the call, please put them on a
speaker. We'll have Randy Moss from DOJ, Nell Hennessey from PBGC, and Barry
Barbash or some similarly knowledgable person from the SEC.
The object of the game is to make certain any DOJ letter (i) doesn't call
existing law (primarily the ERISA church plan rules) into question and (ii)
takes the structure of ERISA and, in particular, the different treatment in that
statute of churches, non-profits and businesses, into account.
