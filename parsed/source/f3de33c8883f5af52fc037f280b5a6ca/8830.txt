Andrea, since the lOA provisions are attached to the Head Start bill in
both the House and the Senate, and since the House Head Start
reauthorization has become such a partisan, problematic bill, it would be
unwise, I think, for the President to praise IDA without also: (1) talking
about the importance of the Head Start program, and (2) saying that the
House should stop playing politics with Head Start and pass a strong
reauthorization bill in the bipartisan spirit demonstrated by the Senate.
