MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

FROM:             DON BAER

SUBJECT:                     SATURDAY   MESSAGE STRATEGY MEETING


        This Saturday, I would like to hold a follow-up to last weekO,s
meeting, to continue developing message events that will carry us from
late March through the month of April. The meeting will be held from
12:30 to 2:00 p.m. in OEOB room 180.

        In particular, the offices and individuals responsible for the
following issues should be prepared to discuss events and ideas that
emphasize these priorities:

           Education (DPC)
           Balancing the Budget (NEC)
           Welfare-to-Work (DPC)
           Campaign Finance Reform (RE)

        It is also important to consider events to build-up to two
upcoming events:

         The White House Conference on Early Childhood Development, April
17 (DPC/HRC)
         The National Service Summit, April 27-29 (SM/SS)



        Additionally, we should consider possibilities for Earth Day
(April 22), which provides an opportunity to launch the PresidentO,s
American Heritage Rivers initiative.  SaturdayO,s meeting will not include
discussion of foreign policy, which we expect to proceed along a separate
track.

        At our last meeting, the policy councils and Cabinet Affairs
agreed to prepare lists of policy and event options; these should be
submitted to Eli Attie (6-5638) as soon as possible, in anticipation of
SaturdayO,s meeting.
