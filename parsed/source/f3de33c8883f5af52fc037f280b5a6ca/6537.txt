TEXT:
As many of you have surmised, and reported to me, the follow up meet·ing on
the proposed POTUS meeting with higher education leaders is scheduled for
tomorrow, Wednesday, March 4 -- not August 4. All I can say is that it
was 10 p.m when I wrote the e-mail below.  I apologize for any
inconvenience to your schedules now or in August.

The meeting will be held in OEOB room 472 at 1:15 p.m. to 2:00 p.m.
Thanks.
