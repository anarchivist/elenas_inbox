TEXT:
Hatch and Hyde have scheduled a joint Judiciary hearing on "Partial-birth"
for next tuesday at 9:30.  They've tentatively set-up two panels :.
advocates and medical types. This is a complete sneak attack. The R's
sent letters to groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood asking them to
testify and also asking them to product and "public documents" they
diseeminated about the procedure.

Kennedy's staff wants us to provide the CDC numbers on abortions.
Leahy's staff has gone back to Hatch's folks making "process" arguments
about how unfair and unilteral this thing has been.
