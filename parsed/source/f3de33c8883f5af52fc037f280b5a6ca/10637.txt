     TEXT:
     A reminder that comments re: the Promising Practices Compendium are due in
     by 4:30 tomorrow. The earlier the better, however, as we are attempting
     to expedite the printing process.  The President will be annoucing the
     Compendium in his radio address this Saturday. Thank you and do not
     hesitate to contact me with any questions.
