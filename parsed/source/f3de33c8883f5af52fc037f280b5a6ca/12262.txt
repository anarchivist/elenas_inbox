TEXT:
Counsel's Office continues to have concerns on both the reckless handling
and restricted individual issues.  Chuck does not want to send a memo to
the President until it is clear what has been worked out and precisely
what the remaining disagreements are.  He would very much like to have a
brief meeting soon rather than engage in continued (and seemingly
fruitless) debate via succeeding email drafts.  Is it possible to pull
together the appropriate people soon -- either Monday am or after 4 pm, or
on Tuesday? And who is the appropriate person/office to do so?
