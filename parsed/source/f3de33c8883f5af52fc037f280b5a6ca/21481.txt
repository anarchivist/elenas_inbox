TEXT:
It is possible that HR 10 - Financial Services Act will be on the Senate
floor anytime now.  please review the SAP and provide comments/clearance
by cob today. This SAP should be shared with all of the principals. The
position: if the bill is presented to the President in its current form,
he would veto it.  Thank you.

October 8, 1998
         (Senate)
H.R. 10 - Financial Services Act of 1998


(Leach (R)   Iowa and 3 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 10, and if the bill were
presented to the President in the form reported by the Senate Committee on
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, he would veto it.

As reported by the Senate Banking committee, H.R. 10 would harm the safety
and soundness of the national banking system and would reduce the role of
this Administration, and any future Administration, in banking policy --
an important area of economic policy-making.  In addition, the bill in its
current form would have an adverse impact on the Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA) and raises a number of other significant policy issues.

H.R. 10 would deny banking organizations the choice of how to structure
their business by dictating that all new principal financial activities
for example, securities underwriting and merchant banking -- be conducted
exclusively in affiliates of banks rather than subsidiaries of banks.

In addition, H.R. 10 grants the Federal Reserve exclusive regulatory
authority over a new type of financial institution, the wholesale
financial institution (WFI). The bill also grants the Federal Reserve
unprecedented authority to contravene the judgements of other banking
regulators about the banks they regulate.    The current and past three
chairs of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have each objected to
this dictate on the grounds that the subsidiary structure better protects
the safety and soundness of Federally insured banks and better shields the
deposit insurance funds, and ultimately the taxpayer, from loss.

The bill would also have an adverse impact on the CRA, which has helped
spur billions of dollars of loans to communities across the United
States.   First, the transfer of new financial activities out of bank
subsidiaries will take those activities out of consideration under CRA,
effectively reducing funds available to meet the needs of local
communities.   Second, the newly created WFls will be exempt from CRA
unless the institution chooses to have a federally insured affiliate.
Given that some of the Nation's largest banks may become WFls, their
assets would be lost for CRA purposes.

The Administration urges the Senate not to move forward on this
controversial, exceedingly complex, and harmful legislation.

Pay-As-You-Go-Scoring

H.R. 10 would decrease direct spending and decrease receipts; therefore it
is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990. OMB's preliminary scoring of the bill is that
it would result in a net budget savings of $333 million over FYs
1999-2003.

(Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This Statement of Administration Policy was developed by the Legislative
Reference Division (Englund), in consultation with the Departments of
Agriculture (Allen) and the Treasury (Dorsey), the US Trade Representative
(Papovich), Farm Credit Administration (McMahon), Office of Personnel
Management (Wolf), Small Business Administration (Cupp) and HTF
(Enger/Veenstra) .

OMB/LA clearance:

The Departments of Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Labor,
Justice, and State did not respond to our request for views on this SAP.

On May 13, 1998, H.R. 10 passed the House with an amendment in the nature
of a substitute by a vote of 214 - 213.

On September 18, 1998, the Senate Banking Committee reported H.R. 10 with
an amendment in the nature of a substitute.

Administration position to Date

On August 7, 1998, the Chief of Staff sent a letter to the Chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee stating that the President will veto H.R. 10 if
it includes provisions that would "stifle innovation and efficiency in the
national banking system and impose needless costs on small banks."  In
addition, the letter opposed H.R. 10 because it would deprive national
banks of power and erode Executive Branch policy-making ability.

On June 17, 1998, the Department of the Treasury testified before the
Senate Banking Committee in opposition to the House-passed version of H.R.
10.

On May 7, 1998, the Treasury sent a letter to the House Leadership and
relevant Committee members restating that the Secretary would recommend
that the President veto the Republican Leadership's version of H.R. 10 and
included a copy of the House SAP.

The House SAP on H.R. 10, issued on March 31, 1998, stated that the
Administration opposed H.R. 10 because it would:   (1) stifle innovation
and efficiency in the national banking system; (2) undermine the Community
Reinvestment Act by forcing financial innovation to occur in holding
company affiliates rather than in bank subsidiaries; (3) diminish the
ability of communities and consumers to benefit from the financial system;
(4) eliminate advantageous features of the current thrift charter; and (5)
impose needless costs on small banks.  The SAP also stated that if H.R. 10
were presented to the President in the form of the Republican Leadership
substitute, the Secretary of the Treasury would recommend that it be
vetoed.

Provisions of H.R. 10

Time did not permit a summary of the manager's amendment to H.R. 10.

The Small Business Administration advises that H.R. 4179, the Program for
Investments in Microentrepreneurs Act of 1998 (PRIME Act), will be added
to H.R. 10 as part of the manager's amendment.  This bill would authorize


qualified organizations to provide technical assistance and capacity
building services to microenterprise development organizations and
programs and to disadvantaged entrepreneurs using funds from the Community
Development Financial Institutions Fund.

Pay-As-YOu-Go Scoring

According to HTF (Enger) and BASD (Lee), H.R. 10 is subject to the
pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of
1990. H.R. 10 would decrease direct spending and decrease receipts and
result in a net budget savings of $333 million over FYs 1999-2003. CBO
scores the bill as resulting in a net budget savings of $337 million over
FYs 1999-2003.
