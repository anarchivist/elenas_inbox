TEXT:
Elena,
Last Friday, Arrney met with Smith and Hyde re: the H-1B bill. Armey
conceded that Smith had the votes to pass his bill, but said that he
(Armey) would not bring it to the floor unless/until Smith strikes a deal
with business on the reforms. According to Peter, Smith is not in a hurry
to do this, but may be looking at Kennedy's more narrow lay-off language
as a place to go.   It is unclear whether Smith wants to do this at all --
he may prefer no bill (thus no visa increase) to a bill that is too weak.
Armey also indicated that he prefers Smith's bill to Abraham's bill.

Peter gave Smith our proposed language (as a possible compromise).  Peter
also thinks that it is important for us to strengthen the perception that
we would veto a bad bill.

As of yesterday, the Smith bill was not scheduled to go to the floor this
week, so it looks like next week at the earliest.

Julie
