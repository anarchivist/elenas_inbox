Bruce/Elena/Rahm:

Per my conversations w/Bruce and Elena today, attached please find the
Brady languaged you requested.  OMB, DOJ and DPC have all seen it, and can
live with it -- and, based on my discussion w/Handgun Control, I think
they'll be fine with it, too.

In short, the language would: (1) prohibit a fee for the next fiscal year;
(2) allow records to be retained for 3 months; (3) provide for a
transition period through 6/99; and (4) guarantee that NICS records are
used only to ensure the integrity of the system.

"None of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act or any other provision of law may be used
for (I) the implementation of any tax or fee in connection with the implementation of 18 U.S.C.
922(t); (2) any system to implement 18 U.S.C. 922(t) that does not require and result in the
destruction, within three months, of any identifying infornation submitted by or on behalf of any
person who has been determined not to be prohibited from owning a firearm. Implementation of
this retention limitation may be phased in over a period not to extend beyond June 30, 1999; at
the end ofthis period all identifying information for non-prohibited individuals that exceeds the
three month retention period must be destroyed. This section does not apply to State-operated
systems for handgun checks. Provided further, that in implementing the NICS the following
provision shall substitute for the requirement imposed on the system in 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(2)(C):
"All background check information maintained in the NICS by the FBI submitted by or on behalf
of a person which has been determined not to be prohibited from possessing a firearm shall be
destroyed by the FBI not later than 90 days after the NICS makes such determination. Such
information may be used by the FBI only for the purposes of protecting the privacy, security, and
integrity of the NICS and identifying fraud in the use of the NICS. Such information may be
maintained as long as needed to pursue identified cases of misuse of the NICS. A knowing
violation of this provision shall be subject to the penalties provided for in 18 U.S.C. 924(a)(5).
The Attorney General shall, within 90 days of the effective date hereof, promulgate regulation
to implement this provision.""
