                                           May 29,1998


 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:          Bruce Reed
                Elena Kagan

 RE:            DPC Weekly Report


           Tobacco -- Senate Update: When the Senate returns from recess, it is scheduled to
  return to the McCain legislation and resume consideration of an amendment by Sen. Durbin to
  increase look back penalties and an amendment by Sen. Gramm to devote most ofthe bill's
  revenues to a tax cut for married couples with income ofless than $50,000 per year (advertised as
. an elimination of the marriage penalty). The Gramm amendment would provide a significant
  tax cut to low- and middle- income people, but would require a 78 percent cut in spending for
  public health, medical research, farmers, and the states. Weare still deciding whether to
  develop and/or support a smaller tax cut proposal. Such a proposal would take the pressure off
  Democrats to vote for the Gramm amendment and ifpassed, would enhance the attractiveness of
  the bill to Republicans; inevitably, however, the proposal would diminish the funds available for
  spending on health research and public health programs.

          Tobacco --Tobacco Farmers: This week the Senate may begin consideration of those
 provisions of the tobacco bill relating to tobacco farmers. The legislation currently includes a
 provision drafted by Sen. Lugar that would buy-out all farmers from the quota program within 3
 years at a cost of $18 billion, eliminating the government program and creating a free market in
 tobacco in its place. The legislation also includes Sen. Ford's measure, which the
 Administration supports, to preserve the program and give farmers the option of being bought
 out, at a total cost of$28.5 billion spread over 25 years. USDA calculates that the Lugar
 approach would lead to dramatic increases in the amount of tobacco grown in the U.S., and a
 reduction in the cost of tobacco for companies. Last week, the Washington Post ran an article
 that included USDA's calculation that tobacco companies will save $800 million a year or $20
 billion over the next 25 years if Lugar becomes law. In addition, OMB estimates that the Lugar
 provision would necessitate a 69% cut in the research and other public health programs called for
 in the McCain legislation. Armed with these numbers, public health groups like the Campaign
 for Tobacco-Free Kids have lobbied the Senate for the Ford measure. Procedurally, the next
 move is for both Sens . Ford and Lugar to try and strike the other's measure from the bill. Along
 with USDA, we will continue to work with Sens. Ford, Robb, and Hollings to build support for
 their farmers provision and simultaneously seek to fashion a compromise that might gamer
 significant Republican votes.

        Tobacco -- Legislation and the House Minority Caucuses: Next Monday, DPC,
OMB, and HHS will meet with representatives ofthe House Minority Caucuses to discuss the
provisions they wish to be inserted into any tobacco legislation. Working out an acceptable
agreement with the Members of the Caucuses is critical to ensuring their support for the overall
tobacco initiative. Weare already hearing that they have grave concerns about the Senate
version of the tobacco bill, particularly as it relates to provisions that block grant the prevention
and cessation investments. As you know, this community has a long-standing mistrust toward
the states and the use of block grants. They are also upset that there are no specific investments
for Historically Black and Hispanic Colleges and Universities and Medical Schools. Their
current alternative raises some significant constitutional and administrative concerns that we
must work through. More specifically, their language has set-aside oriented language that may
run afoul of the Adarand Supreme Court decision and their funding allocations would alter the
investment agreements we have worked out with Senator McCain, as well as create major
administrative burdens for HHS. We anticipate that Monday will be the first in a series of
drawn out discussions designed to reach an acceptable compromise.

        Welfare Reform -- State ReInvestment ofTANF Savings: During your meeting with
W elfare-to-Work Partnership Board members last week you stressed the importance of states
reinvesting their welfare savings in child care, transportation and training. We will work with
HHS to analyze state expenditure data for T ANF and child care. This data is not as timely as we
would like. In the meantime, there is some encouraging information in the NGA Fiscal Survey
of States released on May 27th. The way states are spending their federal and state welfare
funds is shifting from cash to work-related supports. Comparing expenditures of state funds in
1996 with planned spending for 1998, spending for cash assistance decreased 26 percent, while
spending for child care increased 85 percent and spending on work activities increased 34
percent. Total state welfare spending declined by 9 percent, but given caseload reductions, this
actually represents increased spending per person.


         Education -- Gov_ Carper's Testing Program: Prior to your speech to the Delaware
State Legislature, Gov. Carper related to you that Delaware's testing program tests students
against both state and national standards, by combining test items aligned with state standards
with items from NAEP. He reiterated this point in a recent letter following up your trip. We
have followed up with Gov. Carper's staff to get more information about the state testing
program. While it is true that Delaware does have a "hybrid" testing program, it is more
accurate to say that it tests students against national norms, rather than national standards.
Approximately 25% of the items on the Delaware test are taken from the SAT 9 (the Stanford
Achievement Test), and this is sufficient to tell how an individual student ranks compared to
other students nationwide. It does not, however, provide information on student performance
relative to national standards, such as those in NAEP. You may recall that the National
Academy of Sciences is studying the feasibility of statistically linking state tests with NAEP, so
that state tests could in fact test students against national standards. Preliminary indications are



                                                  2
                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

that the NAS report, due July 1, will indicate that few state testing programs will meet the
technical requirements for this kind of linking.

        Education -- GAO report on national testing: Next week the GAO will issue a report,
requested by Rep. Goodling, on the relationship between the Education Department and NAGB
in developing the tests, and the procedures for awarding contracts for test development. The
report affirms that the Education Department has honored the requirements of the law which
placed control of test development with NAGB. In addition, GAO stated it had no concerns
with regard to contracting procedures. While we do not expect the report will alter Rep.
Goodling's position, it does negate one set of arguments he had planned to utilize.

        Education -- Adult Education: You recently asked what the Administration had
accomplished with respect to Adult Education, literacy training and the GED, and whether we
need to take additional steps. The Senate and House Workforce bills, which are expected to be
passed by July 1, provide for the reauthorization of Adult Education programs. Your FY 1999
budget requests a $16 million increase in adult education for state grants, which funds local
literacy, GED and adult education programs. It also includes a request for funds to develop
model English as a second language programs for adults, since 40% of adult education
participants are in such programs. The Education Department has also funded a PBS series,
"Crossroads Cafe" that is a "Sesame Street" for adults learning English. The program is now
shown in 35 states (and 50 countries) and will be expanded shortly. DPC will work with NEC
and the Education Department to explore how we can best highlight the efforts we already have
underway, and what additional steps would be appropriate.

        Health Care -- Assisted Suicide Update: Next week we plan on releasing the Justice
Department interpretation that concludes that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has
no legal authority to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs with the intention of
hastening death. As you will recall, Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde had requested
that the DEAlJustice determine if there was any Federal authority to address Oregon's
assisted suicide law, which permits physicians to provide medications for the purposes of
aiding in an assisted suicide. Consistent with your instructions, we will release this
interpretation, but will also make clear that you maintain your longstanding position of
opposition to assisted suicide and remain open to workable legislative approaches that
address this issue. We expect that Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde will respond by
introducing legislation that provides DEA the explicit authority to press charges against
physicians who assist in suicide. As you know, we believe that a DEA approach is
ill-advised. We will carefully roll-out the announcement of your position on this issue with
both Members and interested organizations, such as the Catholic Health Association and
the American Medical Association and will keep you advised of legislative developments.

       Health Care -- HCFA Letter to Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago: Last week; 15
year old Christopher Sercye died of gunshot wounds just 35 feet from Ravenswood
Hospital in Chicago, where friends had brought the young man for help. Hospital


                                                  3

workers did not leave their posts and apparently would not even give police officers a
stretcher to help the young man. In response, the Health Care Financing Administration
sent out a letter to the President of Ravenswood Hospital on Friday stating that the hospital
will lose its Medicare funding on June 19, 1998, unless the facility takes steps to ensure that
the events that led to the tragic death of Christopher Sercye will not be repeated. You
released a statement to highlight the Administration's strong action. In addition, your
statement urges aU hospitals to follow the recently released guidance by the American
Hospital Association that advise hospitals to change any policies that prevent taking
appropriate actions in a medical emergency.

        Health Care -- Medicare Commission: Next Monday, the Medicare Commission
will be holding another meeting to respond to its Members concerns that they have not had
enough time to have intensive discussions about the major issues of benefits, costs,
eligibility, administration, and financing. Senator Breaux, troubled about the perception
ofthe Commission's irrelevance, has asked Sens. Lott and Daschle to open up the meeting
with words of encouragement on the charge and the potential of this Commission. The
Democrats, including our Commission members, are becoming increasingly nervous that
the Commission's staff and Congressman Thomas are focusing much too heavily on highly
speculative, numbers-driven policy and much too little time on how best to reform the
Medicare program to respond to the delivery challenges it faces in the next century. We
expect they will urge the Commission to dedicate as much time to program design as to
program financing. Our members are increasingly seeking answers from us as to how
comfortable we are in allowing them to engage in serious discussions about controversial
policy reforms on benefits ( including requiring higher cost sharing and more benefits like
prescription drug coverage), eligibility age changes, income-related means-testing, and the
possibility of putting new revenues on the table. In general, we believe that it would be
constructive for the Commission to engage in general discussions on all of these issues with
the exception of new revenues. We believe our members should only address the revenue
issue only if it is determined that traditional saving approaches alone will be insufficient to
satisfactorily address the program's financing challenges. We are working closely with
Gene Sperling and the NEC to assure we have a coordinated message.

        Health Care -- Long Term Care: Aging and disability advocates are increasingly
pressing us to address the issues surrounding long-term care. The demographic changes
in the population make clear that, in the absence of major new breakthroughs in cures and
treatments, there will be an extraordinary increase in demand for services targeted to the
nation's aging and disability population. Because of cost and other limitations, both the
public and private sectors have been slow to develop responses to this challenge. Although
comprehensive solutions are politically and financially unrealistic, we believe that we
should begin a series of targeted policy options to begin to address this problem. These
could include, requiring FEHBP to offer (but not pay for) private long-term care policies,
educating Medicare beneficiaries that Medicare does not cover long term care and advising
them of other options, developing policy options that provide more flexibility to States to


                                                4
                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

provide home and community-based personal care options for Medicaid elderly and
disabled eligibles, and developing possible tax incentive approaches that could potentially
increase the purchase of private long-term care policies. We believe that you may want to
take steps in this area relatively soon and capture at least part of an issue that has
extraordinary political and policy dimensions.

         Community Empowerment -- Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC): This week
staff from the DPC and the NEC meet with representatives ofLISC and the Enterprise
Foundation on ways to secure passage of the LIHTC. Legislation that would implement your
proposal to expand the credit by $1.6 billion now has 50 cosponsors in the Senate and almost 200
hundred in the House.' We asked both organizations for suggestions on how build more support
for the legislation. They are planning to get back to us in the next two weeks.
