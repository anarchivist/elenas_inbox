>       Thank you for inviting me to testify today. My name is Diane Ravitch.   I
>       am
>       a historian of education at New York University and a member of the.
>       National
>       Academy of Education.  I hold the Brown Chair in Education Studies at the
>       Brookings Institution and am a Senior Fellow at Brookings.  I am also a
>       Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the Progressive Policy Institute.
I
> was appointed to the National Assessment Governing Board in 1997 by
> Secretary Riley.  From 1991 to 1993, I served as Assistant Secretary of
> Education in charge of the Office of Educational Research and
Improvement.
> I am testifying today as an individual, not on behalf of any of the
> organizations with which I am associated.
>
> Although I served in a Republican administration, I was not a Republican.
> As a matter of information, I am an independent, and I try to bring a
> sense
> of political independence to the important issues under consideration in
> this hearing today.
>
>       Title I is a vitally important federal responsibility.     It represents the


> nation's promise to help poor children achieve equal educational
> opportunity.  Enacted in 1965, it was one of the signal achievements of
> President Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" program.  Every Congress since
> that time has recognized the importance of Title I and has sought to
> strengthen it.  It is in that context that I offer today some specific
> suggestions for its reauthorization.
>
> Let me say first that I agree with the Administration's emphasis on
> standards and accountability for children in Title I schools. The
purpose
> of Title I is to substantially narrow the achievement gap between poor
> kids
> and their advantaged peers; it is not possible to do that unless there
> are,
> first, well-defined goals for achievement; second, clear performance
> measures; and third, accountability--or real consequences--for good or
> poor
> performance.  It does poor children no good to allocate federal funds to
> states, districts and schools without paying close attention to whether
> children are actually learning and whether the achievement gap between
> poor
> kids and others is shrinking.  I think it is important to point out that
> Title I, as it operates today and has operated for many years, is not
> actually a program with a coherent strategy and uniform activities.
> Rather,
> it functions as a funding mechanism to channel federal dollars into
> districts that have significant numbers of poor children.   Consequently,
> it
> is confusing to refer to it as a program because the money is used in so
> many different ways for so many different purposes.   It supports pull-out
> programs, remediation, whole school reforms, teacher training,
technology,
> classroom aides, and countless other activities.  Some of them are
> effective
> practices, some are ineffective practices, and most of the time, the best
> that researchers can say about any of them is, "It all depends on local
> circumstances as to whether this is effective or not."   So, when we say
> that
> Title I is "working" or "not working," it is usually impossible to
> generalize and always difficult to know what is working and what is not
> working.
>
>   The most recent national assessment of Title I by the Department of
> Education indicated that there had been big gains in reading and math
test
> scores for Title I children between 1994 and 1998.   Math scores in
> fourth-grade have increased since 1992.
> However, in reading, the test scores for children in the highest-poverty
> schools were no higher in 1998 than they had been in 1990.   For poor kids
> who are the intended beneficiaries of Title I, it is not good enough that
> their scores are back to where they were in 1990.   The 1999 national
> assessment of Title I also pointed out that nearly 70% of fourth-grade
> children in high-poverty schools are "below basic" on NAEP tests of
> reading,
> as are nearly 60% on NAEP tests of mathematics.   In low-poverty schools,
> only 23% of fourth-graders are "below basic" in reading and in math.   In
> other words, despite recent gains, poor kids are still far behind in the
> fourth grade; when children can't read and can't do mathematics in fourth
> grade, they tend to fall farther behind as they get older.   For their
sake


>   and for the sake of our nation, we must continue to press to reduce the
> large performance gaps between poor kids and others.
>
> The current system breeds bureaucracy.   It is so complicated and involves
> so
> many regulations that it requires a large number of state and local
> administrators to "run" the program, decide which school gets what, and
> manage the flow of paper.   Because of the complexities of the formula,
> millions of poor children do not receive any Title I services at all
> because
> they are not in a Title I school.   When poor children in Title I schools
> move to a school that is not a Title I school, they lose Title I
services;
> if they decide to enroll in a public charter school, their Title I funds
> may
> or may not follow them.   At present, Title I dollars fund school
> districts,
> not poor children.
>
> As Congress deals with the reauthorization of Title I, I hope you will
> consider permitting some states to try different approaches to managing
> the
> federal funding stream of Title I.  Is it possible that other approaches
> might have a larger impact on reducing the performance gaps between poor
> kids and others? We will never know unless we allow some states to try
> something different and to see if they can get better results for poor
> kids.
> Both Congress and the President consider welfare reform to have been
> successful, yet it had to begin somewhere; it had to begin with a few
> states
> demonstrating that they do better than the status quo.
>
> What I suggest is that states be allowed, if they wish, to turn Title I
> into
> a portable entitlement. This would mean that the federal Title I money
> would follow poor children to the school in which they are enrolled,
> consistent with the state's laws and the Constitution.   Instead of
sending
> Title I money to the states and the districts, it would go to the school
> where the poor child is enrolled.   This would mean that Title I would be
> available to every poor child in a state that tried "portable
> entitlements."
> This would mean that Title I funding would support the education of every
> poor child in those states, not just the poor children who happen to
> attend
> schools that are designated Title I schools by district officials.   If
the
> eligible child changed schools, the federal funds would follow her to the
> new school.  If the child enrolled in a public charter school, the
federal
> funds would follow her there.
>
> Turning Title I funds into a portable entitlement for poor children would
> make the Federal Government neutral regarding school choice.  It would
> neither promote nor impede school choice.  Current policy is not neutral;
> it
> actually denies Title I funds to a child who moves to a different public
> school or to a public charter school.  Turning Title I funds into a
> portable
> entitlement for poor children would reduce bureaucracy.  With a portable


> entitlement, the whole process is simplified and automatic.  Schools
would
> get money depending on how many poor kids are enrolled.  Period.
>
>  Let me be clear about what I am saying and what I am not saying.  I am
not
> proposing to "voucherize" Title I.   I am not suggesting that Title I
funds
> should go to the family, to use as they see fit.   I am not saying that
> Congress should initiate this kind of change overnight, but rather that
it
> should allow some states, if they so choose, to tryout this approach and
> evaluate its effects on schools and on children.
>
>   What I am suggesting is that Title I funds should follow the child to any
>   state-approved school, consistent with the state's laws and the
>   Constitution. Under this approach, more federal money would be spent in
>   schools that enroll poor children, whether they be regular district
>   schools,
>   public charter schools, or any other schools in which the state permits
>   the
>   expenditure of public funds.  These schools could use federal funding in
>   the
>   ways they think will be most effective: for whole-school reforms,
>   reading programs, intensive tutoring, training teachers, smaller class
> size,
> and so on.    Certainly there must be accountability for performance, to
>   help
>   poor kids meet the same academic standards that the state sets for all
>   children.
>
> Accountability requires good information.  One way to improve information
> about performance is to provide incentives for every state to participate
> in
> NAEP and to continue to disaggregate NAEP results by income levels.   This
> information would function as an external audit for Title I and for other
> efforts to increase the achievement of poor kids.  Armed with this
> information, state and local officials should continue to be responsible
> for
> accountability for they have the immediate and ultimate authority for
> accrediting, reorganizing, and even closing schools.
>
>   My proposals have the following purposes:
>
>   First, to concentrate federal funds on poor children, their teachers and
> their schools, rather than state and district bureaucracies.  The
> immediate
> effect of a portable entitlement would be to increase federal funding to
>   every school that enrolls poor children.
>
> Second, to use the Pell Grant program in higher education as a model for
> supporting poor children in elementary and secondary education.   In 1972,
> there was a great debate about how to direct federal funding for higher
> education.  On one side was
> Congresswoman Edith Green, Democrat from Oregon, who said, "Fund the
> institutions based on the number of students they enroll."   On the other
> side was Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island, who said,
"Fund
> needy students and let the funds follow
> them to the institution they attend."   It is now widely recognized that


>    Senator Pell promoted the democratization of higher education when he won
> the great debate of 1972.
>
> The basic principle that I suggest is more federal dollars for the
schools
> that poor kids attend, fewer federal dollars for administration and
> compliance.  I do not claim that my proposal will overnight produce the
> results that we all hope for.  What we do know is that current policies
> have
> a created an overly bureaucratized, rule-bound system that leaves far too
> many children far behind.  The only way to change a federal program of
> this
> kind is slowly and carefully, but with a willingness to try new
approaches
> that hold the promise of better results.
>
>    The demonstrated success of Pell Grants over nearly three decades leads
me
> to believe that a similar approach is worth trying and evaluating for
poor
> students in elementary and secondary education.  Surely, no one today
> would
> suggest that federal funds for higher education should go to
institutions,
> not students.  Yet when it comes to elementary and secondary education,
we
> fund institutions, not children.  Why shouldn't we be willing, on a
> limited
> basis, to allow federal funds to follow poor kids to school as they now
> follow them to college?
