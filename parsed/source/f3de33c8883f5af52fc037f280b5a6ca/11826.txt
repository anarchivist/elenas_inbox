TEXT:
We're starting to have meetings with OPL to discuss the roundtable
participants for the Equal Pay event on April 7. Here's what we were
thinking of. What do you think?

-   President
-   Secretary Herman
-   Ida Castro, Chairwoman of the EEOC
-   5 other panelists

For the other panelists, here are some of our thoughts:
- woman with children who has been paid unequally or man whose wife is
paid unequally
- woman who has retired and who had been paid unequally -- can talk about
effects on her
    retirement savings
- business person from company that has revamped its pay system
- economist - can talk about wage gap generally
- comparable worth woman
