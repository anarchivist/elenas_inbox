Suggested Changes to State of the Union

Page 8-9

        Now we must press on. For there is still far too much crime.    Drug
use among young people is still too high.    Far too many children are
raising themselves on the streets. We cannot go strong into the 21st
Century in children are killing children ... if children are selling drugs
to children ... if children are having children. We have a moral 'obligation
to take the guns out of their hands and teach them right from wrong.

           HereD,s what we must do next.

        Congress should finally pass the juvenile justice crime bill.
[description to come]

        We also must do more to protect juveniles from crime.    Protecting our
children is our most sacred calling -- and, we now know, is one of the
best ways to prevent innocent young people from becoming hardened
criminals.   First, we should abolish parole and establish lifetime
criminal penalties for child sex offenders. [more on sex offender policy]
To protect teenagers from adults who prey upon them, we should establish
tough, uniform criminal penalties for statutory rape -- and tonight I
direct Attorney General Reno to develop model legislation for every state
to adopt. And we must do all that we can to protect children and their


mothers from domestic violence [more on domestic violence policy.]

           [graph on crime and drugs and alcohol-- keep the
same] ..
           [graph on judicial vacancies-- keep the same] ...

        And we have acted to apply our oldest most fundamental values to perhaps
our most stubborn social problem.  In 1996, we ended a welfare system that
had trapped generations of Americans in a cycle of dependency, and
replaced it with a new system based on work and personal responsibility.
Last year, from this podium, I challenged our nation to take the next
step, and move two million more Americans off of welfare by the year
2000. Well I am pleased to report that weD,ve met that goal has been met
-- not in three years, but in one year two years ahead of schedule.

        Think about what that means. Think of those the children who now have
working role models, whose mothers now go to work, and the families who now
 have the dignity of a paycheck instead of the indignity of a welfare
check. We are joined here tonight by one family who last year made this
momentous journey from welfare to work.  [Name] represents millions of
others like her who are now connected to mainstream America and the world
of work. We salute them all. [Name] could you please stand? Think of the
neighborhoods where hope is replacing despair.

        To create more success stories like [Name] we must do even more to
promote work and personal responsibility.-- increasing child support
collections even further,  WeD,ve increased child support collections by
63 percent, but we must ensure that all parents take responsibility for
the children they bring into this world.  We should start by establishing
new penalties for states that have failed to put in place systems to crack
down on deadbeat parents. providing vouchers to help families move closer
to where the jobs are. WeD,ve already re-written the welfare rules so that
young mothers must live at home and finish school, but we must do more to
stop the alarming increase in children born outside of marriage. Tonight
I am pleased to announce a nationwide competition that will reward state
efforts to reduce out of wedlock births.

        We must help those on welfare get to where the jobs are -- through
new funds for welfare to work transportation and new portable housing
vouchers.  Families could use these housing vouchers to move closer- to a
new job, to reduce a long commute, or eliminate housing emergencies that
interfere with getting to work every day on time. And the private sector
must do its part. -- And above all Tonight I challenge 10,000 more
businesses must to join the [x,OOO] companies in our welfare-to-work
partnership, now nearly 3,000 strong, to give a chance to someone who is
willing to work their way off welfare.
