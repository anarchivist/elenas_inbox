TEXT:
FYI, one reason for OMB's logic on favoring the disabled (after entry)
over the aged is that sponsors of those disabled after entry had no way of
predicting that the person they sponsored would become disabled when they
made the decision to sponsor, whereas people who sponsor the aged
obviously know that the person is old and probably can't support
themselves.
