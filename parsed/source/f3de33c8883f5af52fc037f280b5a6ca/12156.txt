TEXT:
I just spoke with Ann O'Leary at ED, we're trying to coordinate the rest
of the ESEA meetings. Ann suggested the following:

Wed - social promotions - at 5pm meeting today in Barbara's office
Thurs -- rollout strategy -- during the 5:15 time slot (apparently, Mike
Smith is cancelling a trip and will be here on Thurs)
Fri -- All other outstanding issues (secondary schools, phys ed, Puerto
Rico etc) .

Bruce: Ann thought that you wanted a smaller group than would normally be
at the meeting in Barbara's office to discuss social promotions.  Do you
want to schedule something other than today's 5PM meeting?
