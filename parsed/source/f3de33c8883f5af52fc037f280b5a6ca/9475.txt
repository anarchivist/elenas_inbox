TEXT:
Attached are my two final inserts for the weekly. The insert on the
Medicare HMO pull-out is no doubt too long, but I am too close to it to
determine what is not important enough to not give to him.  That is why we
have you, right?j

One last point. You need to know that on Tuesday, the press will report
on the Census Bureau's finding that the number of uninsured increased by
1.7 million to 43.4 million. Jeanne Lambrew has an insert that I am
reviewing/editing that she feels that she needs to give to Gene Sperling
for his weekly. She continues to get criticized for not submitting health
care inserts for Gene and continues to be put in a very uncomfortable
position. As you know, my primary interest is to make sure the POTUS has
the information, but I know it is also very important that DPC gets more
than its share of the credit for the work.

The release of the uninsured data is obviously an important development
because some of the liberals and the media will be quick to jump on the
welfare reform bill as the reason.   Although there may be some
justification for citing the law's unintended effects (which, by the way,
the law was explicitly designed to address) as being one of a number
factors, we do not have enough back-up data to really get a good picture
of all the reasons.   (In fact, it should be noted -,- and it will in the
insert we are drafting -- that the finding could be an arguably favorable
result of welfare reform; Americans previously on welfare are now earning
higher wages in an improved economy; unfortunately, their incomes are
getting so high -- over 100 percent of poverty that they are no longer
qualifying for Medicaid and they are entering the part of the job market
that frequently offers no or poor coverage)

I think we should move fairly quickly to develop an Administration
response to this issue. Otherwise, HHS will -- on an off the record basis
-- confirm some of the problems, perhaps in a not too flattering light.
How do you want to proceed?

I will fax the draft uninsured insert over to you for your review.  If you
feel strongly that we should also have an insert, I could do an
amplification piece.==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

the Medicare program are seriously contemplating pulling out of the program prior to the
October 1st plan enrollment deadline. As of this writing, it appears that plans serving between
100,000 and 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries may terminate their contracts with the program.
These numbers represent a relatively small percentage (5-7 percent) of the 5-6 million
beneficiaries participating in Medicare HMOs and do not even include the beneficiaries that
would be served by the over 40 contracts HCFA has recently received for new Medicare HMO
business. Having said this, if plans follow up on their threat and there is any significant
dislocation, this development will no doubt receive a good deal of attention. The HMOs blame
inadequate payment rates and excessive regulation. Health economists are generally dubious
about "sky is falling" arguments and believe that some companies are simply extracating
themselves from some markets from which they cannot make immediate profits.
In practice, these HMOs are "cherry picking" the regional payment rates that are generous and
dropping those regions that are less lucrative and/or that have relatively small HMO market
share. Few experts accept the excessive regulation argument either, as most of these plans
comply with extremely similar rules in the private sector. To make the market more attractive
and (perhaps) increase the chances some of these plans stay in the program, the industry is
asking to be able to cost-shift onto beneficiaries by increasing premiums, co-pays or reducing
benefits, particularly drug coverage. Although beneficiaries have chosen to come into these
plans precisely because of the marketing of these benefits, the plans correctly argue that Medicare
has never. guaranteed them. We are currently evaluating whether any of these options would
have any real impact on HMO participation in the program and, if so, whether they are worth
any serious consideration. We also need to start contemplating the implications of managed care
market trends on the upcoming Medicare reform debate. HHS will be briefing Erskine and
White House staff on our choices on Monday. In the meantime, we are developing alernatives
and alliances with members of the Committees of jurisdiction of both parties, as well as the aging
advocates (like AARP), to develop a common position. To date, few are very sympathetic to
the objections and proposals raised by HMOs. We will keep you apprised with developments.

FDA Commissioner Update. Jane Henney, your nomination for FDA, was reported out by voice
vote out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee this last week. Although we remain
concerned that one or more of the conservative Republicans (like Nickles) will object to bringing
her up for even a vote, this Committee action was extremely encouraging and has brought a
sense of optimism that -- with some work and horse trading -- Dr. Henney has a shot of being
confirmed this year. We will re-engage Senator Domenici, her homes tate Senator and ally, in
pushing some of his Senate Republican colleagues. During the Vice President's Cancer March
speech on Saturday, he will challenge to Congress to confirm the first oncologist and the first
woman to serve as FDA Commissioner.
