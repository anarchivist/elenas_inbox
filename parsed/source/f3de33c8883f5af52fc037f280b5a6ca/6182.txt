Bad news:
As I think Mike told you, we did not win the fight to get the event in an
elementary school.  Begala, Craig, and Ann sided with NSC on going to a
High School for 3 reasons:   1) Blair specifically requested speaking to
high school students.  (I tripled check and the NSC swears they refused a
college or elementary school visit),
2) Blair's and our communications folks feel it's better to have the
principals speaking to an auditorium full of cheering students who are
able to understand the concepts being discussed, and 3)    everyone agreed
the press coverage is certain to be about the overall idea of two foreign
leaders agreeing on the same principles for the future.   I fought really
hard against this, and I'm not convinced these are very good reasons but I
was outnumbered.

Good news:
The event is definitely going to take place in MD, and most likely at the
Montgomery Blair High School.   Montgomery Blair is a science and math
magnet school, very diverse. They already have internet connections set
up to schools allover the world.   Has great test scores.

Decisions:
we have to decide on the format of the event. Begala wants to have an
internet photo-op where the President and Blair talk to students in
England and then have kids from Montgomery Blair send an email.
Apparently, this is something Blair does a lot of and the Brits would
rather do something different.  They want a town hall -- and obviously we
can't do that.  So we're offering them a roundtable plus the internet
photo-op.  I'm sure this will change, but wanted you to know the initial
ideas floating around.
