PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON FOOD DISASTERS
April 18, 1998


        Good morning. This week, Americans are coming together to help
people who have lost their homes in the devastating tornadoes that have
swept across the South. They are gathering together clothing, bedding,
and canned goods to help the victims of these terrible storms to rebuild
their lives.

        Today, I want to caution all Americans to exercise care when
selecting canned products to donate -- especially imported canned fruit
Ju~ce.  Many of these products were produced under sanitary conditions
that do not meet our own high standards.  Others are tinned in cans with
lead seals that can leach into the juice and harm our children.

        Our administration has tried repeatedly to make the countries that
produce these unsafe juices improve their safety standards, but our pleas
have fallen on deaf ears. We have even threatened not to trade with these
countries -- all to no avail.   And don't forget: Ameri'can juice means
more than American safety standards.  It means American jobs.

        So please, before you toss that dented can of slightly fermented
guava juice into the storm relief box, remember our children, remember our
workers, and remember America.

           Thanks for listening.
