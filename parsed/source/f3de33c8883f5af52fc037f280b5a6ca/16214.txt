                      PREVENTING INSURANCE DISCRIMINATION BASED
                               ON GENETIC INFORMATION

Today, the President pledged his commitment for bipartisan legislation in the Congress to prohibit health
plans from discriminating on the basis of genetic information. Senator Jeffords, Chair of the Labor and
Human Resources Committee and Senator Frist, Chair of the subcommittee and a physician, also
announced that they share the President's commitment in passing a bipartisan bill that is consistent with
the goals laid out in the HHS report.

The Progress and Promise of Genetic Testing. Genetic testing has the potential to identify hidden
genetic disorders and spur early treatment. Tests for genetic predisposition to certain diseases and
conditions -- such as Huntington's disease and certain types of breast cancer -- are already available and
more genetic tests are on the horizon.

Genetic Discrimination: The Perils of This Progress. But genetic testing also can be used by insurance
companies and others to discriminate and stigmatize groups of people. Studies have shown that:

·      22 percent of people in families where someone has a genetic disorder report that they have been
       discriminated against by an insurance plan.

·      85 percent of Americans report that they are extremely concerned with the possibility that their
       genetic makeup will be used to discriminate against them or a member of their family.

Building on Kassebaum-Kennedy. Kassebaum-Kennedy took steps to prohibit genetic discrimination
by preventing insurers from using genetic information as a "pre-existing condition" and denying or
limiting coverage in group markets. However, Kassebaum-Kennedy falls short in three areas. It does
not: (1) prevent health plans in the individual market from denying coverage on the basis of genetic
information; (2) assure that premiums settings are in no way based on genetic information both in the
group and individual market; and (3) prevent health plans from disclosing genetic information to insurers,
to plan sponsors, and other entities regulated by state insurance laws, such as life, disability, and long-term
care Insurers.

State laws are insufficient. Nineteen states have already enacted laws to restrict the use of genetic
information in health insurance and many others have introduced legislation. However, state legislation
is insufficient to solve this problem. First, private sector employer sponsored health plans, which covers
half of all Americans, are exempt from state insurance laws due to ERISA preemption. Second, current
state laws generally focus on genetic tests rather than a broader definition of genetic information such as
family history, medical records, and physical exams. Finally, the variability among state bills willieild to
a lack of uniformity across the nation as to whether and how genetic information may be used by health
plans.

Building on the existing bipartisan commitment to the President's challenge. Several bills have been
introduced in this Congress which prohibits health plans from requesting or using genetic information to
deny health care coverage or raise premiums. The bipartisan legislation introduced by Rep. Louise
Slaughter, H.R. 306, addresses the three major gaps left by the HIP AA legislation and represents a strong
foundation for this much-needed reform. It has already attracted over 150 cosponsors. The HHS
report released today recommends building on this legislation and enacting a bill that protects all
                                      Hex-Dump ConvelSion ·

Americans from the threat of genetic discrimination.
