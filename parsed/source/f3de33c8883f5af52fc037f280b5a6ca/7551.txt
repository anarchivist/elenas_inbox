Here's a Nickles-inspired attack on McCain, using nominal rather than real

Cynthias, we should probably have Q&A.

Republicans see tobacco bill cost underestimated

WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - A Senate Republican analysis of the tobacco
bill puts the
25-year cost to the industry in the neighborhood of $700 billion, far more
than bill sponsor Sen.
John McCain estimates, according to Senate sources who expect the report
to be released late
Friday.

Commerce Committee chairman John McCain, an Arizona Republican, estimates
that the tobacco
industry would have to pay about $516 billion over 25 years, not counting
extra penalties that would
kick in if the industry missed youth smoking reduction targets.

The new report will be issued by the Senate Republican policy committee,
and may bolster critics of
the bill,.tentatively slated to come to the Senate floor in 10 days. Until
it is publicly released, it is not
clear whether the diverging estimates come from different views of the
bill itself, or from such factors
as inflation estimates.

The McCain bill got a bipartisan 19-1 vote in the Commerce Committee, and
its backers still believe.
that some rank and file Republicans will support it, or a bill that
resembles it, despite the opposition
of some Senate Republican leaders.

  Assistant Republican Leader Don Nickles of Oklahoma, a fierce critic of
  the McCain bill, plans to
. introduce either an alternative bill or a set of major amendments to
  significantly scale back McCain's


blueprint for bringing down teen smoking.

Nickl~s has criticized the price tag, as well as provisions giving the
Food and Drug Administration
explicit authority over nicotine and tobacco. Nickles opposes an FDA
requirement, already in effect,
that cigarette purchasers must show a photo identification if they look 27
or under.

On the other side, some anti-tobacco lawmakers, mostly Democrats, want to
raise the price even
higher, boosting McCain's $1.10 per cigarette pack price increase to $1.50.

Meanwhile, both sides have stepped up their advertising. The industry is
running ads in at least 40
markets, hitting themes about big government, taxation, and how the high
cost of cigarettes would
create a black market.

Democratic critics estimate that the industry has planned a $50 million
television, radio and print
campaign against the bill, although that sum has not been spent so far.
Industry spokesmen have said
that estimate is too high.

The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Friday started its own print ads,
showing the Marlboro Man
hovering over ·two children. Ads are targeted to specific Congressional
districts and Senators.
