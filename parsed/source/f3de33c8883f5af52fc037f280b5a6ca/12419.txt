TEXT:
Question:       Does the Administration suppo'rt the expected findings --
including a moratorium on                        gambling expansion and
more regulation of Indian Gaming -- from the National
Gambling                Impact Study Commission?

Answer: Since the'study has not yet been forwarded to the
Administration it would be premature to                 comment. However,
The Administration looks forward to receiving the study and
glvlng          it careful consideration. However, I would like to
point out that this Administration recently             issued
important regulations on Indian Gaming designed to help facilitate the
ability of              states and tribes to permit gambling on Indian
lands
