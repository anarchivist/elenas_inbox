TEXT:
By way of follow up on the AG prefering option 1, what steps do we need to
take? Otle option would be to push DOJ/OMB to come up with a realistic
cost estimate and then draft a brief memo for the President before this
ball moves further down the public tracks. Alternatively, we could let
things go a little further in the vetting with Kennedy.   Thanks again for
the HUD idea.
