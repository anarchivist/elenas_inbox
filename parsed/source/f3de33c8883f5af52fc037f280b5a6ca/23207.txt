DRAFT PRESIDENTIAL LETTER TO THE ED-FLEX CONFEREES

Dear

I am deeply concerned by the action taken by the Senate in its version of
the Ed-Flex bill, S.280, to undermine the bipartisan commitment the
Congress and I made last fall to help the nationD,s schools begin hiring
100,000 teachers to reduce class size in the early grades.

As parents and teachers across America understand, smaller classes can
make a profound difference for our children.  Studies show that teachers
in smaller classes give more personal attention to students and spend less
time on discipline; as a result, students in these classes learn more and
get a stronger foundation in the basics. Across the country, students in
smaller classes outperform their peers in larger classes. And reduced
class size makes the greatest difference for minority and disadvantaged st
udents.

The SenateD,s action would allow local school districts to opt out of
class size reduction altogether by shifting the $1.2 billion appropriated
for new teacher hiring into special education.  It is divisive and wrong
to pit one group of students against another in this way.  Both class size
education and special education programs make unique contributions to
helping students achieve high standards and deserve our strong support.

The extension of the Ed-Flex authority permits States to waive certain
Federal laws when doing so can help them raise educational achievement
a concept that has strong bipartisan support.  The Conference should not
imperil that support with an amendment that undermines our previous
commitment on reducing class size.

If the Congress sends me a bill that includes the Senate provision to
undermine Class Size funding, I will veto it.
