TEXT:
Heads up - According to Earl Gohl of DOL Congressional, Sen. Feinstein's
staff (Mark Kadish and Lavida Strickland)   requested a meeting to discuss
wage issues in the context of a legalization program for farmworkers and
they met with this afternoon.    I am waiting to get a full report from
Earl but from what I gathered from his voice mail is that they discussed
in length issues related to wages - prevailing, adverse and something in
between called a "premium wage".    However, it does not sound like
Feinstein is very far along in developing her legislation.    I will
provide an update when I hear back from DOL and propose next steps.

Fyi - Last week during the Senate Subcommittee Immigration hearing on the
H2A program, there appeared to be some interest and support from members
for some type of legalization programs for farmworkers.

Thanks.
