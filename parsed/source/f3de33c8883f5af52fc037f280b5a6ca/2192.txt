TEXT:
Apparently the VP's office has finally set a date for the Brownfields
announcement.  It will be this Tuesday.  The event will be in Washington,
and will include, it is my understanding, Senator Daschle and the Mayor of
Atlanta. However, I do not have all the details yet.   I am letting the
VP's office know that we have to see any policy paper and the speech
before the event, to make sure it is consistent with what the DPC and OMB
have signed off on.
