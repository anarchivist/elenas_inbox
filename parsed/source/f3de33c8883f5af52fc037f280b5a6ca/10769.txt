                          Education Accountability Q's and A's


Q.   Why is the President proposing these new accountability requirements now?

A.   Later this Spring the President will send to Congress his proposal to reauthorize the
     Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This is the right time to make changes in
     federal education policy.

     In preparation for this, the Education Department has undertaken a review of education
     policy and performance nationwide, and of the ways in which federal education programs
     can be strengthened. Based on this analysis--confirmed by an independent report
     released last week by the trade publication Education Week -- we know that states and
     school districts have made great progress in raising academic standards for students, but
     have not made the same progress in making these standards count, for students, schools
     or educators.

     For example, only 26 states require students to pass high school graduation exams, and
     far fewer have policies preventing unprepared students from being promoted. Only
     nineteen states have policies in place to intervene in low performing schools, and take
     responsibility for turning them around. Every year, approximately 50,000 individuals
     teach on "emergency" certificates, which means that they do not meet the standards states
     themselves have set for beginning teachers. The vast majority of these individuals wind
     up teaching in our schools with the largest concentrations of poverty, so that the most
     disadvantaged students, who need the best teachers, are instead more likely to have the
     least well prepared teachers.

     The President is convinced that the only way that students will be able to meet the higher
     standards that have been set for them is if educators, schools, school systems, states and
     the students themselves are held accountable. That is why he is proposing these
     requirements now.

Q.   Does this proposal mean that states that do not adopt these policies will lose their
     share of federal education funds?

A.   By making these accountability mechanisms -- providing school report cards, ending
     social promotions, ensuring that teachers meet state standards and intervening in failing
     schools -- a requirement of receiving funds under the Elementary and Secondary
     Education Act, we fully expect that states will adopt them, just as states have complied
     with the accountability requirements in Goals 2000 and the current ESEA to adopt
     academic standards and measure student performance in meeting the standards.
     Governors of both parties, state and local school superintendents, and other educators are
     actively pursuing these throughout the country. Many states are already implementing
     these policies, and our proposals, if enacted into law, will speed up that process and
     spread it to all states.
                                                                     I lex-Dump CcnvGision
Q.   But what if they don't comply? What will you do then? Will the Education
     Department withhold federal education funds?

A.   Again, we think these are reasonable requirements, and we expect states to comply. As
     with any other domestic grant program, the federal government is able to, and must,
     attach conditions to the grant to ensure that the funds are spent effectively and achieve the
     intended results. These accountability requirements are intended to do just that.

     As in other domestic grant programs, there are a range of options available to the
     Secretary of Education to ensure compliance with these requirements. Often working
     with state officials or using the bully pUlpit is an effective way to gain compliance. In
     addition, the Secretary always has the ability to deploy a graduated series of sanctions,
     consistent with procedural safeguards [including specifically the right of states or districts
     to appeal], including withholding funds the state or school system uses for administering
     these programs, withholding a portion of the program funds, or, ultimately, withholding
     all of the funds.

Q.   Isn't this exactly the kind of "federal power grab" that Republican's in Congress
     complain about with regard to the federal role in education. Doesn't this amount to
     a federal takeover of education?

A.   No. These are accountability requirements--many of which state and local school
     systems are already implementing or considering--that are necessary to ensure that federal
     funds have their intended effect. After all, Title 1 funds, targeted to disadvantaged
     schools, can't provide the full measure of help if states permit unqualified candidates to
     become teachers.

Q.   Are you concerned that the requirement to end social promotion will lead to an
     increase in retention rates, especially for minority youngsters? Won't you have a
     problem with the civil rights community on this?


A.   If all we did was wave a magic wand and say "don't promote anyone who doesn't meet
     the standards" this fear would be warranted. But our policy will require that states and
     school districts phase in this requirement over time and use that time to reduce class size,
     provide more training to teachers, and provide extra help to students who need it. The
     President's FY 2000 budget will help, by tripling funding (from $200 to $600 million) for
     after-school and summer-school programs that can provide extra help to students who
     need it.

Q.   Many of the school systems that hire teachers on emergency credentials are big
     cities--which have a hard time attracting more qualified teachers. What will they
     do to find teachers if you end that practice?

A.   First, our biggest cities--and our poorest rural areas--have the greatest difficulty attracting
                                                                               f ,~kOump (;olivGision


fully qualified teachers, arid are therefore most likely to hire teachers on emergency
credential. Our most disadvantaged students suffer the most from this practice, because
they get the least qualified teachers. That is why it is so important to end this practice.

It is not feasible to end it immediately. That is why we would require that the practice be
phased out over five years.

We also provide help for school districts to phase out this practice. For example, the
President's proposal to reduce class size allows school systems to use up to 15% ofthe
funds to recruit and better train teachers--so they can hire fully certified teachers in the
firs't place, or give them the training to bring them up to standards after they are hired.
And creating smaller, more manageable classes will make it easier to attract good people
into teaching. The President's budget will contain an increase in funding for teacher
recruitment programs included in last year's Higher Education Act, a program that
provides scholarships to prospective teachers who cornmit to teach in high poverty
communities.

Ultimately, though, while the federal government can and will help, this is a state and
local responsibility. They set the standards for entering the profession, and they hire the
teachers. By hiring teachers who don't meet the standards, our most disadvantaged
students are hurt the most. States and local school systems will have to find additional
ways to make it more attractive for good teachers, with salary increases, better working
conditions, or whatever it takes. When there is difficulty getting qualified doctors to
urban or poor rural hospitals, no one accepts the idea of hiring unqualified doctors. We
shouldn't accept that practice for education.
