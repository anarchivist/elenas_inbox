             ONE AMERICA: THE PRESIDENT'S INITIATIVE ON RACE


A Stronger America. The President is leading us through a critical transition to a new era,
building a new nation to meet the challenges in the century ahead. His agenda has elements in
trade, the post-Soviet security framework, getting our fiscal house in order, a domestic investment
and renovation strategy spearheaded with education and the environment. America cannot be its
best in the new economy and the new era unless it is One America. Building One America is a
critical piece of the work we must do to build the future we want for our children. And the
greatest obstacles we face in creating One America are the fault lines of color that in many ways
still divide our communities, minds and hearts.

As we enter the next century, we face economic and non-economic challenges. By drawing
from the strength of every American we strengthen our nation.

·      Our rich diversity strengthens our abitity to compete and win in the global market place.
·      Our diversity makes our unique culture and our nation a richer place to live.
·      The cost of a nation divided along ethnic and racial lines is horrific (Bosnia).
·      Equal treatment offellow Americans is a core principle of what defines our nation --
       treating others with dignity and respect is part of what it means to be an American.

A Post-Civil Rights Era_ The past two decades have been a time of great change, and our
nation has entered into a new era with new challenges. Much turns on recognizing the new
nature of the challenges. In race, the traditional civil rights agenda oflegislative and regulatory
attacks on discrimination accomplished a great deal, including a remarkable transformation in
civic norms. But times are different now, and we must move forward in a context much
changed from the 1960s. The demographics of race move us beyond the black-white paradigm.
The competitive global economy attaches higher costs to misfires in America's opportunity
engine. All of this requires a new and expanded agenda to achieve the racial justice required for
One America.

This is not about integration in the old sense, nor about anti-discrimination law enforcement
alone. This initiative is about a broader goal of opportunity and rcsponsibility, rcaching every
American. Achieving that goal requires all Americans to face the age-old problems of interethnic
hostility, suspicion, and rivalry based on color, which is particularly as compounded by class.
The challenge is great, but we must meet it to forge the social compact for the New Economy.
We must do this for One America that is just.

The Goal of One America. The President's powerful and important vision for One America is
to create a nation in which diverse citizens can recognize, respect, and celebrate their differences,
yet can live and work and join together as one community and one nation. His vision rejects the
extremist assimilationistl"melting-pot" and the "identity politics" models that seek to deny the
rich diversity of our differences or require that the differences divide us. By embracing our
                                                                              Hex·Dump Conve:sion ·
diversity as a source of strength, our cultural lives will be enriched, and our ability to compete
and win in the global market place will be enhanced.

The Advisory Board. The President has asked seven distinguished Americans of diverse
backgrounds and talents to reach out to the nation and give him their counsel. The Advisory
Board is chaired by Professor John Hope Franklin and its members include Linda
Chavez-Thompson, Suzan D. Johnson Cook, Thomas H. Kean, Angela E. Oh, Robert Thomas
and William F. Winter. Based on the advice of his Advisory Board, the President is focusing the
policy efforts on educational and economic opportunity. The Board also recommended that the
President place a special emphasis on reaching the youth of America, in order to establish the
foundation for long-term, enduring progress.

The Course. This President's vision is extremely ambitious and cannot be achieved in one
year. However, through his Initiative on Race, the President intends to set the nation on a
course, leading us in the right direction for achieving One America for the 21 st century.
Throughout his presidency, President Clinton has worked to promote opportunity, responsibility,
and community for all Americans. By building on these themes, expressing his vision for One
America and listening to the views of Americans from around the country, President Clinton
intends to put the mechanisms in place to help us achieve the promise of one nation; undivided,
with liberty and justice for all. Through Action, Dialogue, and Study, the President's Initiative
on Race will help chart our course toward achieving the President's vision.

         Action: The President and the Race Initiative are identifying and developing policy
initiatives that will build community, support personal responsibility, and create opportunity for
all Americans. In addition to policy actions undertaken directly by the federal government, the
Race Initiative seeks to identify and foster the successful state and local government programs, as
well as the private, non-governmental activities, that are already working to achieve the
President's vision. Taking the recommendation of the Advisory Board, the primary focus of our
policy action will be to enhance educational and economic opportunity, as well as to support the
efforts of Americans who are currently working to bridge racial divides. Also, because
discrimination is still an unfortunate reality for too many of our citizens, the President will ensure
that our civil rights laws are strictly enforced.

·      Providing quality educational opportunity to all. On July 17, 1997, in an address
       before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, President
       Clinton announced a $350 million proposal to attract talented people of all backgrounds
       to teaching at low-income schools and to improve the quality of training and preparation'
       of America's future teachers. This new initiative will help bring nearly 35,000
       outstanding new teachers into high-poverty schools in urban and rural areas over the next
       five years.

·      Enforcing the nation's laws and preventing housing discrimination. President
       Clinton has directed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo to lead

                                                  2
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conve~ion -
    the federal effort to crack down on housing discrimination. On September 30, 1997,
    Secretary Cuomo announced that HUD will double the number of civil rights
    enforcement actions by the year 2000. Secretary Cuomo also announced that $15 million
    dollars was being given to 67 fair housing centers around the country to assist in
    combating housing discrimination this year. Since the September 30 announcement,
    HUD has initiated _ new enforcement actions in _ _ states, including one against a
    West Virginia couple who allegedly threatened a black family with a knife and gun, and
    intimidated the family by hanging plastic ducks, painted black, to a cross on the family'S
    property. [Correct in/ormation is expected/rom HUD today.]

·   Promising Practices. Community efforts are crucial to the success of the President's
    Initiative on Race. In communities throughout the country, people are working to bridge
    racial divides and to create equal opportunity for all. Recognizing that long-term
    progress depends upon the efforts of citizens, the Race Initiative is identifying and
    creating a compilation of descriptions of efforts deemed "Promising Practices," so that
    others may participate in them, or replicate them in their own communities, schools,
    businesses, and religious organizations. Thus far, 14 Promising Practices have been
    highlighted on the Race Initiative's Web site, and there will be at least 40 highlighted by
    the President's Town Hall on Race on December 3. As more practices are identified,
    they will be featured on the Race Initiative's Web site, discussed by Advisory Board
    members during their travels around the country, and included in the President's Final
    Report.

·   Corporate Leadership.    In a landmark achievement, the Small Business Administration
    (SBA) has reached an agreement with the "Big Three" U.S. automakers that will increase
    subcontract awards to disadvantaged and minority small businesses by nearly $3 billion
    over the next three years -- a 50 increase over current levels. This unique public-private
    partnership marks the first time a major industry group has engaged in a cooperative
    effort with the SBA to increase private sector opportunities for small, disadvantaged
    business.

·   Recruiting leaders. Throughout the year, the President will seek the active engagement
    of leaders in several sedors to support and advance the goals of the Race Initiative.
    Identifying leaders to help carry out the President's vision will provide both breadth and
    depth to the Initiative and ensure that the effort continues beyond this year. Leaders
    from various sectors will be identified throughout the country, with a special emphasis on
    recruiting leaders from three areas: education, religion and corporate America.
    Already, hundreds of university and college presidents have agreed to foster dialogue and
    engage their campus communities in our effort. A group of corporate leaders has started
    working to engage the business community, and the faith community is exploring ways in
    which it can continue this important effort beyond this year. Most importantly, the
    President seeks the active involvement of youth leaders throughout the country so that the

                                                                  Automated Records Management SYstem
                                                                          Hex·Dilmp Conve:sion ·
        President vision can be realized and maintained throughout the 21st century.

·       Focus on Youth. The 21 st century belongs to the youth of today. Throughout the year,
        the President and the Race Initiative will aggressively seek the active participation of
        America's youth in achieving the President's vision for One America in the 21st century.
        By engaging youth -- soliciting their ideas and recruiting youth leaders -- we hope to
        ensure that the important new direction we take this year will lead to long-lasting and
        permanent change through their stewardship of America's future.

·       The President's Report to the Nation. [/ am awaiting Chris's input.] In addition to
        his ongoing leadership in this effort throughout the year, President Clinton will issue a
        Report to the nation that will serve as a useful resource book on race, and provide a road
        map for creating One America in the 21 st century. His report will capture his vision for
        One America and will include significant facts pertaining to race, some of the most
        effective promising practices, a report on the status of the nation's dialogue on race, and
        more. The President's Report will help guide the nation toward achieving the high ideals
        to which it aspires.

        Dialogue: Throughout the year, we are engaging the nation in a discussion on our
values, our communities, and ourselves: What unites us? What divides us? How can we build
bridges o/understanding between America's diverse racial communities? By creating genuine
and honest dialogue between and within communities, we hope to understand what obstacles we
face, and, more importantly, successful ways in which we can overcome these obstacles to come
together as One America.

·       Presidential Leadership. The President is reaching out to many groups -- including
        youth groups, white ethnic groups, racial minorities, and others -- to share his vision of
        One America, as well as to listen to their ideas and concerns.

        ·      Race Town Hall: On December 3, the President will host a Town Hall meeting
               in Akron, Ohio, to engage young people and others in a discussion about race in
               America, the values that unite us, and the obstacles we have to overcome.

        ·      Hate Crimes Conference: On November 10, the President and Attorney General
               Janet Reno hosted the first-ever White House Conference on Hate Crimes, which
               featured many experts and law enforcement officers from around the country.
               The President announced significant law enforcement and prevention initiatives to
               get tough on hate crimes.

·       Conversation with the Nation. The members of the Advisory Board and the executive
        director have spoken with over 100 audiences, amounting to more than 10,000 people.
        These meetings provide an opportunity for the Board members to share the President's
        vision of One America as well as to receive the input of Americans of all races on the

        areas in which we have established common ground and on the obstacles that we must
        continue to strive to overcome.

·       Listening to the Nation. In addition to the feedback received by Advisory Board
        members, the Race Initiative is establishing One America: Conversations that Bring Us
        Together -- which are actual conversations hosted by Presidential appointees around the
        country to solicit the views of Americans on how we can achieve One America. Further,
        through the Race Initiative Web site and letters, Americans are providing their advice on
        how we can move forward together.

        Study: Throughout the year, and through a variety of vehicles, we will seek to educate
Americans on the facts on race. Together with the Council of Economic Advisors and leading
experts from the statistical agencies, the Race Initiative will compile and publish relevant factual
indicators on the status and relevance of race in America. By next spring, a comprehensive
resource book will be published and much of the information will be included in and inform the
President's Final Report. In the interim, facts and information will be posted on the Race
Initiative's Web site (www.whitehouse.govllnitiativesiOneAmerica) and discussed during
Advisory Board meetings.
