                               MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK

                                                        June 26, 1998

    "For America to continue to prosper, as many Americans as possible must contribute in a productive way and learn the
    profound responsibilities of work and independence. "

                                                                                  -- Vice President Al Gore

     Today, Vice President Al Gore travels to San Antonio, Texas with Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman and
     participates in a town hall discussion on the role of service and faith-based organizations in providing support to
    !people moving from welfare to work.

    A COMMITMENT To MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK. In 1996, President Clinton signed
    sweeping welfare reform legislation aimed at moving welfare recipients onto the payrolls. As part of the
    balanced budget legislation signed last year, the Administration fought for $3 billion in welfare-to-work grants, to
    help move long-term welfare recipients into lasting un subsidized jobs. Seventy-five percent of these funds are
    distributed to the states by formula through the Department of Labor. Today, Vice President Gore announces a
    $76 million Welfare-To-Work grant for the state of Texas to help the hardest-to-employ welfare recipients find
    and keep good jobs. With today's announcement, Texas becomes the 23rd state to have a formula grant approved
    by the Department of Labor.

    RESOURCES FOR INNOVATIVE IDEAS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. Welfare-to-Work grants allocated by the
    Department of Labor allow localities to target the needs of welfare recipients in their communities. Among the
    services these grants can provide are job placement, on-the-job training, community service jobs and other work
    experience opportunities, employment assistance for non-custodial parents, and-job retention services such as
    child care, transportation, and substance abuse treatment.

    WORKING WITH COMMUNITy-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. Last year, the Vice President launched the
    Welfare-to-Work Coalition to Sustain Success, a cooperative effort among national civic, service, and faith-based
    organizations that work with states and local agencies to help those moving from welfare to work succeed on the
    job. This partnership includes such groups as the YMCA, YWCA, Salvation Army, United Way, Boys and
    Girls Clubs, Goodwill, and the Women's Missionary Union, who provide mentoring, job training, child care
    transportation and other support to help these workers with the transition to self-sufficiency.

    A SOLID RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. The innovative ideas launched by the Administration are having
    positive results. Welfare rolls have fallen 37 percent since 1993 and 27 percent since the enactment of welfare
    reform. Today, the percentage of the U.S. population on welfare -- 3.3 percent-- is at its lowest level since 1969
    and recent studies show that ever increasing numbers of welfare recipients are going to work.

    SUPPORTING DISLOCATED WORKERS. While in San Antonio, the Vice President will also announce a grant
    which will enable the Alamo Workforce Development Board to assist 3,180 workers in the greater San Antonio
    area who will be affected by the reduction-in-force program at Kelly Air Force Base in 1999 and 2000. This
    grant will support re-training and job placement services, including: outreach to affected workers, skills testing,
    job search assistance, vocational and on-the-job training, job search assistance, customized education, and child
    care and transportation assistance.
