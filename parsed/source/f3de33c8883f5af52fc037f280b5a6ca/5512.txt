MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         BRUCE REED
              GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:      Access Reforms that Prepare Medicare for the Twenty-First Century


Overview

       The Balanced Budget Act that you enacted took critically necessary steps to modernize
the Medicare program and prepare it for the twenty-first century. It extended the life of the
Trust Fund to 2010, invested in preventive benefits, provided more choice of plans for
beneficiaries, strengthened our ongoing fraud activities, and lowered cost growth to slightly
below the private sector through provider payment reforms and modest beneficiary payment
increases. However, the Balanced Budget's policies do not address the long-term problems
posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation.

       The Medicare Commission was established to address the demographic challenges facing
the program. However, a major policy and political question remains. Is there anything we can .
and should do prior to the March 1999 Commission deadline that could further strengthen the
program and lay the groundwork for implementation oflikely Commission recommendations?

        The National Economic Council (NEC) and Domestic Policy Council (DPC) have led an
interagency examination of several, targeted policy options. We examine options for coverage
for pre-65 year olds, the income-related premium, and a project to increase awareness of private
long-term care. In addition, our efforts to both improve benefits and promote research are
combined in a proposal to cover the patient care costs of clinical cancer trials.

        Your advisors have not reached consensus on the best policy or financing mechanisms for
these options. It may well be the case, however, that the traditional Medicare savings available
will not be sufficient to offset the costs of these proposals. As such, a decision to propose a
pre-65 policy may be feasible only if the decision is made to propose an income-related premium
or, much less likely, dollars from any residual tobacco savings.
                      I
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
A.     PRE-65 HEALTH INSURANCE OPTIONS

        People between 55 and 65 years old often face greater problems accessing affordable
health insurance. They are at greater risk of having health problems, with twice the probability
of experiencing heart disease, strokes and cancer as people ages 45 to 54. Yet their access to
affordable employer coverage is often lower due to work and family transitions. Work transition
increase as people approach 65, with many retiring or shifting to part-time work or
self-employment as a bridge to retirement. Some of this transition is involuntary. Nearly half
of people 55 to 65 years old who. lose their jobs due to firms downsizing or closing do not get
re-employed. Family transitions also reduce access to employer-based health insurance for the
increased number of people who are widowed, divorced, or whose spouse has gotten Medicare
and retired. Asa result, the pre-65 year olds, more than any other age group, rely upon the
individual health insurance market. Without the advantages of having their costs averaged with
other younger people (as in employer-based insurance), these people often face relatively high
premiums and, because of the practice of medical underwriting, may be unable to get coverage at
any price if they have pre-existing medical conditions.

         These access problems will increase due to two trends: the decline in retiree health
coverage imd the aging of the baby boom generation. Recently, firms have cut back on offering
pre-65 retirees health coverage; only 40 percent oflarge firms now offer such coverage. In
addition, in several small but notable cases (e.g., General Motors and Pabst Brewery), retirees'
health benefits were dropped unexpectedly, despite the firm's commitmerit to the workers ..
These "broken promise" retirees do not have access to COBRA continuation coverage and could
have difficultly finding affordable individual insurance. A more important trend is the
demographics. The number of people 55 to 65 years old will to increase to 30 million by 2005
and 35 million by 2010 - over a 50 percent increase. This could raise the number of uninsured
in this age group from 3 million today to 4 million by 2005, not even taking into account the
decline in retiree health coverage.

Policy Questions

      Two central questions guide policy decisions in this area: what is the target population,
and what is the best way to cover these people.

        Who to Target. As with any incremental reform, targeting is essential to ensure that the
policy does not unintentionally reduce employer health coverage. In this case, the concern is
that a broad and generous policy could both encourage people to retire earlier or accelerate the
decline in employer contributions and/or coverage. At the same time, the current level of
employer dropping suggests that a policy for the affected people is needed. Although your
advisors remain divided on the advisability of implementing a new policy in this area, we all
agree that if you decide to move in this direction that any policy should include protections
against substitution. The easiest way to accomplish this is limiting eligibility to a subset of the
pre-65 year olds. There are two design approaches worthy of consideration.
                                                                        H~x·Dump COnYf;fSion
        The first approach is to limit eligibility by age. We recommend an age break of 62. The
6 million people age 62 to 65, compared to people ages 55 to 59, work less (x percent versus y
percent), are more likely to have fair to poor health (26 versus 20 percent), and are more likely to
be uninsured or buy individual insurance (28 versus 21 percent). In addition, it is also the age at
which Social Security benefits can be accessed. Within this group, we could limit eligibility to
those without access to employer or public insurance, and would require that they exhaust
COBRA coverage before becoming eligible, to limit the incentive to retire or drop retiree
coverage due to this option.

        A second approach is to limit eligibility within the 55 to 65 year olds by a group's lack of
access to employer-based insurance. Three groups have particular problems. (1) Displaced
workers: About 60,000 people ages 55 to 65 lost their employer insurance when they became
displaced workers (lost their job due to the finn closing, downsizing, etc). Only about
one-thirds of these people get re-employed. (2) Medicare spouses: About 420,000 uninsured
people are spouses (mostly wives) of Medicare beneficiaries. They may have lost employer
coverage when their husbands turned 65 and retired. (3) "Broken promise" people: A small
but vulnerable group is the pre-65 retirees who lose retiree health coverage due to a "broken
promise" (employer unexpectedly tenninates coverage).

        How to Target. The second question is: what is the best way to increase access to
affordable insurance? One approach is to extend COBRA continuation coverage for longer than
18 months. Currently, COBRA allows workers with insurance in finns with 20 or more
employees (CO BRA exempts small finns) to continue that coverage for 18 months by paying
102 percent of the premium. The major problems with this approach are that not all people are
eligible, businesses will consider this an unfunded mandate, and such a policy could lead to
discriminate against hiring older workers. Despite the difficulties of COBRA extensions, it
appears to be the best option for the "broken promise" people, since the fonner employer would
bear some ofthe costs of their decision to terminate coverage.

        A second option, preferable for most of the target groups, is a Medicare "buy-in".
Eligible people could buy into Medicare at the age-adjusted Medicare managed care payment
rate, with an add-on for the extra risk of participants. Since the actuaries think that most
participants will be sicker than average, this add-on will be costly. To attract healthier people
and thus reduce the add-on, we could "amortize" it, meaning that the participant would pay it in
installments with their Part B premium after they tum 65, not all at once. In other words,
Medicare would pay part of the premium up front, with the beneficiaries paying back this amount
over time. The HCFA Actuaries have estimated that this Medicare "loan" in a worse-case
scenario would cost $1.1 billion per year (this estimate assumes participation of no more than
300,000 people). Because they assumed only sick people would participate, that all 300,000
would enroll in one year, and because they did not take into account the pay-back from
beneficiaries, the official estimates, expected next week, will probably be lower.
Policy Options and Preferences                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

        Option 1. "Broken Promise" People Only. All your advisors recommend a policy to
require employers who break their promise of retiree coverage allow those retirees to buy into
their active employer plan at a rate of 150 percent of the premium (since this age group is more
expensive) until age 65. This option has no cost to the Federal government. Treasury favors
only this approach, due to concerns about an "encroaching entitlement" of a .Medicare buy-in
proposal.

         Option 2. Medicare Buy-In for Select Groups. The second option is to allow a
limited group of 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. OMB favors the Medicare spouses -
primarily uninsUred women ages 55 to 65 whose husbands are already on Medicare. They argue .
that if the goal is a limited test of a buy-in for the pre-65 year olds, this is a discrete group whose
eligibility would likely have no effect on the general trend in retiree health coverage or
retirement. Labor strongly supports policies to help displaced workers, since it fits with the
broader theme of trying to improve the security of workers. While a Medicare buy-in would
help more of these workers, in the absence of a buy-in, Labor would support a COBRA
extension. Treasury is ambivalent about this option, except that they have major concems about
targeting displaced workers because in this age range it is hard to draw the line between what is
involuntary retirement and what is voluntary retirement. HHS supports covering these select
groups only if they are added to a 62 to 65 year old buy-in, since the administrative effort of
doing a buy-in for so few people would be great. The fact that there will be low numbers of
participants for these selected groups also means that the costs will be small.

         Option 3. Medicare Buy-In for 62 to 65 years old plus selected groups. The third
option is to limit eligibility to age 62 to 65 years old plus the Medicare spouses and displaced
workers. HHS and NECIDPC think that this is a narrow enough group to limit any effects on
retiree health coverage or retirement. It also is more representative of the 65 to 67 year old
population, giving a better sense of what would happen if Medicare eligibility were postponed to
67 years old. Some of Treasury's concerns about this option would be allayed if the buy-in
participants were enrolled only in managed care, so that the insurers and not Medicare would
bear the risk. The cost of this option is not known yet but is likely to be less than $5 billion over
5 years.

       It is important to note that we are still waiting for the detailed analysis of these options
from the Office of the Actuary. That will give all advisors a better sense of the implications of
the choices and could alter recommendations.                                             .
B.     INCOME-RELATED PREMIUM
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
       It is likely that the pre-65 coverage initiative costs more than traditional Medicare savings
could produce, needing revenue from a policy like an income-related premium. As you know,
Medicare subsidizes 75 percent of the Part B premium for all beneficiaries, including the
wealthiest. This is not only regressive; it ignores the fact that studies show that higher income
beneficiaries actually cost Medicare more than poor beneficiaries.

Policy Options

        Building from our position from last summer, the income-related premium would be
administered by the Treasury Department, not HCFA or the Social Security Administration.
Annually, eligible people would fill out a Medicare Premium Adjustment form (a separate form
or a line on the 1040 form) and send a check to "The Medicare Trust Fund". The two open
questions are: who pays and how much do they pay.

       Who qualifies. Last summer, the Senate passed a policy where the extra premium
payment began at $50,000 for singles and $65,000 for couples. However, we p~oposed higher
thresholds in the Health Security Act: $90,000 for singles and $115,000 for couples. These
thresholds determ~ne how many people are paying the higher amount.

        How much is the extra amount. The amount of the payment for the wealthiest
beneficiaries is a second question. In the budget debate, we argued that would should not go to
a 100 percent premium (no subsidy) because that could cause some healthy and wealthy people
to opt out of Medicare .. However, an analysis by the Treasury Department this fall found that the
effects would be small (about 5.% of beneficiaries who pay the full premium would drop). Ifwe
decided to change our past policy, it might be advisable to have a strategic discussion about the
timing of announcing such a change. It could be an important in negotiating the give and take
on this issue. Revenue willlikelybe at least $8 billion over 5 years, depending on the policy.

Discussion

       From a policy perspective, OMB and Treasury continue to support this policy, and would
probably recommend that we begin at the $50,000 / $65,000 level and fully phase out the subsidy
[check]. HHS has expressed strong concems about this policy in light of the changed
environment. They argue that Medicare has already contributed $115 billion in savings and that
we should wait for the Commission recommendations before the next round of major changes.

         From DPCINEC's perspective, it is a matter of balance. On one hand, it is almost certain
that this policy will be recommended by the Medicare Commission. At that point, however, we
will have no opportunity to direct any of its revenue toward important Medicare reforms like a
Medicare buy-in. In addition, between the baseline and policy reductions, it is highly unlikely
that there will be enough health savings in the future to redirect toward coverage initiatives. If
we do not pursue the premium and have insufficient funding for coverage initiatives, this will be
the first time that your budget will not include a new coverage expansion initiative, with the
exception of the period in which we were debating health reform.
         On the other hand, we need to seriously consider the fact that many Democrats and
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
possibly AARP would oppose the income-related premium for the same reason HHS cites.
The one exception to this rule is if it is explicitly linked to the pre-65 policy. In addition,
Republicans might take this opportunity to label this as a new tax and use it as an issue during
the 1998 campaign. Even ifhe philosophically supports the premium, Speaker Gingrich might
use the high-income premium's ''tax'' label as cover for his likely opposition to a Medicare
buy-in.

                                                                                      Automated Records Management System
         C.     ACCESS TO PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE OPTIONS                              Hex-Dump Conversion

                  A second idea to improve access to insurance focuses on long-term care. Unlike acute
         care, long-term care is not primarily financed by private insurance, which only pays 6 percent of
         its costs. Medicaid pays for 38 percent, Medicare pays for 16 percent, and families pay for
         one-third of the costs out of pocket. This large government role may not be sustainable as the
         baby boom generation retires. Today, one in four people over age 85 live in a nursing home.
         This could increase substantially as the proportion of elderly living to age 90 is projected to
         increase from 25 percent to 42 percent by 2050. Thus, it is important to encourage the
         development of private insurance options. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation took a step in
         this direction by clarifying that long-term care insurance was deductible. However, given
         people's general lack of understanding about the importance oflong-term care insurance, more

                 We propose to leverage our role in Medicare to improve the quality of and access to
         private policies. Medicare would allow certain private long-term care policies to be included in
         its general information on Medicare managed care. HCFA would work with insurers, state
         regulators, and other interested parties to develop a set of minimum standards. If a plan met
         these standards, it could be included in the new managed care information system. As a
         reminder, the BBA 1997 included provisions to provide annual information on managed care
         choices to beneficiaries. This proposal would build upon that system and would cost up to $25
         million over 5 years.

                 There is general agreement across agencies that this is an important first step, although
         there needs to be more discussion of its details. There is some concern at HHS that coming to
         an agreement on a set of standards could be difficult and that insurers may argue that our
         standards drive up the cost of the policies, making them unaffordable. However, these concerns
         may not be insurmountable with input from the industry.

                                                                                     Automated Records Management System
        D.    MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CANCER CLINICAL TRIALg'fex-Dump Conversion

                 We have developed a' proposal that would expand Medicare to cover additional services
        associated with cancer clinical trials. This proposal would not only help Medicare beneficiaries,
        who represent a significant portion of cancer patients, but would set a standard to encourage the
        private industry to cover clinical trials. It would also almost inevitably increase participation in
        cancer clinical trials and would be particularly helpful for cancers, such as prostate cancer, that
        have inadequate treatments and have difficulty attracting participants. Because of the way our
        actuaries score this proposal (CBO would score it for less costs) and because we wanted to
        ensure we would be reimbursing for high quality trials, we have had to narrow our original
        proposal to something that may not be uniformly embraced by the advocates. It is, however,
        likely to be supported (with some minor adjustments) by Senators Mack and Rockefeller. Having
        said this, our current proposal is quite expensive and its opponents (in and outside the '
        Administration) will criticize its precedence-setting potential to expand to other diseases, and in
        so doing, tap the Medicare Trust Fund at precisely the wrong time.

        Background

                 Scientists and advocates alike agree that we are simply not making sufficient progress in
        treating cancer and that weaknesses in our current cancer clinical trials system are a significant
        part of this problem. For many cancers, such as lung cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian
        cancer, we still have little success with treatments. Even where better treatments are available,
        the process of developing and assessing improved therapies is still too slow.

                One significant problem with the current clinical trials system is that only 3 percent of all
        cancer patients participate. According to one former National Cancer Institute director, if 10
        percent of all cancer patients participated in such trials then trials that currently take three to five
        years would only take one year. This would likely accelerate the improvements of treatments.
        Moreover, historically most insurers have covered clinical trials for children. As a consequence,
        nearly 70 percent of children with cancer participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this
        fact has he1pedimprove cancer treatments for children, and some argue that this is one reason for
        the dramatically higher survival rates for children cancer patients.

                One leading reason that patients do not participate in clinical trials is that a many insurers
        do not cover them or make it prohibitively difficult to participate. Changes in the health care
        delivery system have made it less likely that clinical trials will be covered. In fact, it is on
        average 30 to 40 percent more expensive to cover participants in managed care than traditional
        fee-for-service and far more burdensome. As a result, clinical trials, which seem to be
        undersubscribed, are having an even harder time finding participants. This problem has
        significant implications for research in all cancer areas, particularly for those cancers such as
        prostate cancer where scientists still do not have good answers about treatment and where
        clinical trials are particularly undersubscribed.
                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

              Expanding Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials would represent an important step for
       two reasons: First, nearly half of all cancer patients are older Americans covered by Medicare;
       and second, as the nation's largest insurer, Medicare plays a significant role in setting the
       standard for the insurance companies. A commitment from Medicare to cover clinical trials
       would go a long way in encouraging private insurance companies to agree to cover these trials.

       Proposal

               In response to the interest in the breast and prostate cancer patient advocate community,
       we have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials conducted at the
       National Cancer Institute and trials with comparable peer review. This initiative would cost
       $1.7 billion over five years and would be paid for by a variety of Medicare anti-fraud offsets.
       There are options that cover a larger percentage of clinical trials, including a bill proposed by
       Senator Mack and Senator Rockefeller (co-sponsored by 26 Senators) that we believe goes too
       far by covering all FDA trials, many of which the experts believe do not meet a
       scientifically-meritorious standard.

       Validators and Opponents

               There is no question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer
       community as well as many in the women's community who believe this is an essential step to
       improve breast cancer treatment. How.ever, the advocates have made it clear that they would
       strongly prefer the more expansive and expensive RockefellerlMack approach. We are working
       to determine whether we can modifY our more limited proposal in a way that they would support.

               HHS is supportive of this policy. OMB and Treasury, however, strongly oppose this
       proposal because they believe it is bad policy and sets an almost unstoppable precedence. While
       the DPCINEC believes that OMB and Treasury raise valid concerns, we would support this
       proposal if we can develop an affordable option that both Senator Rockefeller and Senator Mack
       and the cancer community would strongly support. Ifwe cannot obtain such support in short
       order, we would recommend not including it in the budget. We would be in a very good
       position to argue our likely support for a significant increase in biomedical research will also pay
       large dividends in cancer breakthroughs and are more than sufficient in this budget year.
       Finally, if it becomes clear that our final cost estimates for the Medicare buy-in are low enough
       to be financed by the available $2 billion in traditional (anti-fraud) Medicare savings, the DPC
       and NEC would recommend giving serious consideration to use these limited dollars to support
       the Medicare buy-in proposal.
