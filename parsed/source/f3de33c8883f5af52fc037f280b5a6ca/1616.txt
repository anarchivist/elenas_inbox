TEXT:
Today's Voting Rights Act meeting with ED and Justice will be
rescheduled.  Since the NYTimes reports this morning that Justice has give
a green light to NYC, it is no longer urgent to meet.  Since I can't be
there, both Judy Winston and Elena agreed that it would be better at this
point to reschedule until some time next week when we can all participate,
and to use the time and distance from the NYC issue to make it easier to
focus on the larger policy issues.
