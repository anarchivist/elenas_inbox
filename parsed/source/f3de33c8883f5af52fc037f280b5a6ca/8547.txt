TEXT:
There are a couple of farm issues coming up that you should be aware of ,
including a possible meeting with the President.

Daschle wants to meet with the President on his proposed amendment to the
Agricultural Appropriations bill which would do the following: (1) remove
the caps on commodity loan rates imposed under the 1996 Farm Bill,
allowing the rate to be calculated as an average of the past five years'
market prices; and (2) extend the term of marketing assistance loans for
any commodity for up to 6 months (basically extending loan terms from 9
months to 15 months) .

With respect to the extension of the loan terms to 15 months, USDA and OMB
are both in favor of it.  This part of the amendment should have no net
cost.

With respect to the removal of the caps, USDA says that Glickman is on
record being in favor of it, but OMB is not in favor of it because it
requires significant funding and it moves away from the market-oriented
approach taken by the 1996 Farm Bill. OMB says that CBO's costing of this
provision is $1.9 billion in FY99 with a five-year cost of $3.5 billion.
USDA reports that they heard estimates that are significantly less than
this. USDA feels that there is no harm in supporting it because it will
not pass anyway.
