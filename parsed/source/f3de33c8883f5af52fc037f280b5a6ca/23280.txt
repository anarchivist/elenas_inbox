 TEXT:
 This is the meeting that we had discussed earlier in the year to discuss
 what battles we have coming up in Congress, as well as our proactive
 strategy.

 I'm interested in your input re: the meeting agenda. I thought Caroline
 could review for us what's likely to be on the floor in the next 6 months;
 Elena could review where we are on policy (have there been any changes
 since last year); and Ann could lead a discussion on the politics and
 message. Specific choice issues we need to discuss include: late-term,
 child custody protection, Title X, clinic violence, contraceptive
 coverage. Melanne asked that we have a separate meeting on int'l family
 planning when she returns from Africa. In addition to the meeting agenda,
 who have I missed below to invite? Thanks.
