TEXT:
The Shaw FICA proposal that we endorsed was the one Shaw offered (or tried
to offer) on October 9th at the tax technicals markup.  It does not
include any change to what can count as work for the purposes of the work
participation rates, as I said this morning -- despite what Governor
Thompson's staffer thought.  It is a straight FICA/FUTA exemption.   It was
also endorsed by Governors Carper and Chiles in an October 9th letter to
congressman Rangel, who opposed it.

Emily and I will make sure Thompson's folks have the right copy.
