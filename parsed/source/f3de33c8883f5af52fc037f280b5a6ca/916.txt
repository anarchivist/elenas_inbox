TEXT:
Sorry for the short notice but 'i' d like to get together tomorrow at 11: 00
in 107 EW to discuss late-term abortion.    I am also asking HHS and DOJ
legislative affairs to attend. Daschle's staff would like to meet
tomorrow afternoon at either 4 or 5 pm in room 509 hart so I thought we
should get together beforehand. You are all invited of course to the
Dasch1e meeting.  The Senator has a decision memo and we will be
discussion the staff's recommendations.    I have also asked that they pull
together their larger Senate working group next week so we can begin to
hear from other Member offices.    That meeting has been set-up for 2pm next
Friday 2/28 room TBD.

please let me know if you can attend the 11 am tomorrow.
Do you prefer 4 or 5 pm with Daschle's staff?
will you be able to attend the 2/28 meeting with Senate working group?
