Scientists Update Foodborne Pathogen Recommendations

New Report Discusses Food Safety
 Scientists offer 18 recommendations as a platform to focus and stimulate
efforts toward food safety improvements. The Council for Agricultural
Science and Technology (CAST), an international consortium of 36 scientific
and professional societies, released a report Foodborne Pathogens:  Review
of Recommendations in which a CAST task force of 18 scientists updated the
15 recommendations contained in the 1994 CAST report Foodborne Pathogens:
Risks and Consequences. The task force members represent a variety of
organizations and backgrounds including consumers, producers, the food
processing industry, governmental agencies, academicians, private
consultants, epidemiologists, microbiologists, economists, and attorneys.

Information Is Critical Food Safety Problem
 Information continues to be the critical food safety problem.   Pathogens
cannot be seen with the naked eye, so the public cannot readily detect the
safety of meals, foods, or ingredients purchased anywhere along the food
continuum.  The ability to link human illness with foodborne pathogens also
is difficult.  Thus, the majority of foodborne illness cases are
unreported.
The complexity of food safety from farm to table requires many types of
scientific expertise to design sensible public and private interventions.
 The original report Foodborne Pathogens: Risks and Consequences published
by the Council for Agricultural Science and Technology (CAST) in 1994 was
well-received and widely quoted.  With encouragement of producer
organizations, governmental employees, scientists, and public interest
groups, the CAST Board of Directors authorized an update of the


recommendations from the original report.

What Do the Experts Recommend?
 The CAST task force members strove to provide recommendations that are
specific and practical with the goal that efforts involved in moving toward
implementation of these
recommendations would ensure real improvements in the safety of foods.
Briefly stated, the 18 recommendations are as follows.

 Foodborne Pathogen RecommendationsD?CAST News ReleaseD?Page 2


 Goal Setting
1. Base food-safety policy on risk assessment and include risk management
and risk communication .strategies.
2. Base food safety regulations on risk assessment and risk management.
3. Set federal food safety goals and priorities.

 Research Needs
4. Expand food-safety information database by more complete reporting of
the
incidence of foodborne disease by pathogen, by food, and by contributory
factors.
5. Conduct continued, rigorous epidemiologic studies to assist in
establishing the cause of illness and effect of foodborne occurrence of a
particular pathogen or toxin.
6. Improve and regularly update foodborne disease estimates.
7. Support research on mechanisms of chronic illnesses associated with
foodborne pathogens.
8. Use dose-response modeling in the risk assessment process.
9. Conduct research to identify likely domestic and imported food and
pathogen/toxin associations.
10. Encourage and support vigorous fundamental and applied research efforts
related to foodborne pathogens.
11. Develop rapid, accurate detection methods for foodborne pathogens and
toxins.

 Production Control
12. Require producers, aquaculturalists, and seafood harvesters to adopt
effective preharvest intervention strategies in the interest of enhancing
public health.
13. Apply foodborne pathogen control practices from food source to
consumption.
14. Harmonize international food safety standards.

 Education
15. Educate the general public and food handlers relative to safe food
preparation and handling.
16. Identify high-risk populations and provide food safety education.
17. Provide risk information relative to food choices to persons with
enhanced disease susceptibility.
18. Use and evaluate food labeling to communicate safe food preparation and
storage practices to food preparers.

A detailed discussion of each of the above recommendations is contained in
the full report.  The report is available in print and on the CAST World
Wide Web site at http://www.cast-science.org.

'.
      Editor: A free copy of Foodborne Pathogens: Review of Recommendations is
     available to journalists on request.
      Foodborne Pathogens: Review of Recommendations, 45 pages, is available
     for
     $15.00 from CAST.  CAST identifies food and fiber, environmental, and other
     agricultural issues and interprets related scientific research information
     for legislators, regulators, and the media for use in public policy
     decision
     making. CAST is a nonprofit organization of 36 scientific societies and
     many individual, student, company, nonprofit, and associate society
     members.
