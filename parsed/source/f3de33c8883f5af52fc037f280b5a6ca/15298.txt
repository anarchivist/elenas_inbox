TEXT:
I just learned that we are not going forward until Friday, however, FYI:

        Today I am announcing that we will appeal this morningO,s Federal
District Court decision to block our efforts to protect children from the
deadly harms of tobacco.

        This not a matter of choice; it is a question of survival: every
year, 3000 of our young people will start smoking, and a third of them
will die from it. But tobacco companiesO, more than $5 billion-a year
marketing schemes lure our children with a message that smoking is cool:
cigarette packets are emblazoned with cartoons like Joe Camel; t-shirts
and baseball caps bear the logos of cigarette brands; and billboards near
our childrenO,s schools and playgrounds picture a world of adventure for
people who smoke.               .

        We cannot afford to stand idly by while our childrenO,s lives are
at stake. So last summer, we took action to stop the kind of tobacco
marketing that tempts our young people to smoke, and we made it harder for
children to buy cigarettes. We knew it would not be an easy fight, but we
knew it was the right thing to do. And we will continue to do everything
we must to protect our children from tobacco, and to help them lead
healthy, productive lives. That is why we will appeal this ruling, and I
am confident that we will prevail.
