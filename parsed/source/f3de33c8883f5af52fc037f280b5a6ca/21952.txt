TEXT:
Bruce, we've dug around a bit more to find out what Archer said on these
issues but it doesn't sound like there's much more there there at this
point.

On 11/20, Archer delivered the Republican response to the Presiden't radio
address on social security, followed by a news conference. He used the
news conference to layout the 4 elements of the Ways & Means agenda for
1999: 1) tax cuts, 2) social security, 3) fighting protectionism, 4)
"welfare reform part two".   Among the accomplishments he cited was moving
people from welfare to work.     That's all he said in his statement and in
a release.  In response to a question from a reporter asking "what are so
me of the changes you see for welfare", Archer said:
"We must continuously monitor the welfare reform program. It is not a
process that has ended; it is a continuing process. And there are two
things that I want us to focus on: I want us to focus on abstinence
education. We are finally beginning to see a decline in teenage
pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births. We should do everything we can to
hasten that. And secondly, we need to give the states even more
flexibility in the use of the block-grant funds for child care."

Based on issues raised to the committee in the past (and high on states'
agenda), and comments from Ron, we think the last statement could refer to
several things:

1) expanding the definition of assistance to make it easier for states to
spend TANF funds on child care w/o invoking the TANF requirements such as
time limits, reporting requirements and assignment of child support rights
(the TANF NPRM included child care subsidies to individuals w/in the
definition of assistance, and HHS does not believe they have statutory
authority to change this interpretation even if we wanted to w/in the
final rule).

2) expand transferability from TANF to CCDF (child care fund) and/or SSBG
to give states more ways to spend TANF $ on child care for a broader low
income population and w/o the TANF requirements. Currently, states can
transfer up to 30% to CCDF, including up to 10% to SSBG.  But, TEA-21


reduced the SSBG transfer to 4.25% beginning in 2001 and as you know, OMB
has a proposal to institute this cap in 2000 to help pay for SSBG
restoration.

3} -- this is purely speculation on my part, but the reference could be to
the child care block grant rather than the TANF block grant, in which case
maybe he's talking about some kind of credit for moms staying at home ??

Ron had indicated to HHS staff right after the Archer statement that there
wasn't any more detail to share, but they are following up to see if
anything's changed.

Re: Archer's point on abstinence education, while the trends for teen
births and teen pregnancies are positive, the preliminary 1997 data from
NCHS on out of wedlock births to all age groups shows numbers and rates
holding steady (though there are caveats because CA and NY changed the way
they report maritial status in 1997). Also, just as a reminder, PRWORA
did set aside $50 M annually for grants to states for abstinence only
education. All states applied and received grants in 98, and I believe
all states also applied for 99 (last I checked the 99 grants had not been
finalized).  Perhaps he's thinking about increasing this funding level??
