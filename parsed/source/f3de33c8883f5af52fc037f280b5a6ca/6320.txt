I spoke to Fazio's and Waxman's staff today. Fazio is mulling over
whether he will introduce Conrad in the House. Waxman will be supportive
but sees Conrad as a floor for negotiations and not a ceiling.  In
particular, Waxman would like to see the penalties and ETS sections
strengthened and would like to do more on advertising that doesn't depend
on industry consent.

       According to Conrad's press person, (Tom Mahr isn't in) they have the
       following Senators confirmed to attend:
               Daschle
               Conrad
               Bingaman
               Durbin
               Kennedy
               Lautenberg
               Leahy
               Reed
               and Fazio
               Waxman

       They're trying to find out how many others have signed on as cosponsors.
       I told him that we are concerned that the numbers are much lower than we
       originally thought.
