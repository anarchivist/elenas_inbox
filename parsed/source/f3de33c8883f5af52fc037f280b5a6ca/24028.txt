                STRENGTHENING POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS
                                June 9,1999

President Clinton will serve as the moderator for today's roundtable discussion on
police-community relations. With the assistance of Professor Charles Ogletree from Harvard
Law School and Christopher Stone from the Vera Institute of Justice, the President will outline
several hypothetical situations involving interactions between law enforcement officers !llld
members of the community. He will then follow up by asking individual panel participants a
series of questions as to how they would respond to such situations. Some of the examples that
the President will use during this discussion are:

HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION #1:

       The police chiefin a mid-size city is presented with requests from neighborhood watch
       organizers and other residents in a minority, high crime neighborhood to increase police
       patrols in that area. They particularly are concerned about young men loitering on the
       comers and in front of liquor stores, and they complain of gang activity and drug buys.
       When the chief added patrols in the past, the police were criticized strongly by others
       from this same community and civil rights activists for being heavy-handed.

HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION #2:

       The Chief of Police of a major city has an aggressive program to stop cars in the city that
       appear to be carrying gang members and to question the driver and passengers. Gang
       activity in the city principally has involved gangs of African American, Hispanic, Asian,
       and Eastern European young people.

       The police chief has just come to the see the Mayor about a crisis. A few hours ago, two
       officers, one white and one Hispanic, stopped a low-riding car carrying three teenage
       black males based on a minor traffic violation, but something went terribly wrong. After
       the stop, there was an argument and the officers thought they saw one of the passengers
       reach into the back seat; they saw something shiny and thought it was a gun. They
       opened fire, injuring the driver and one of the passengers. No gun was found in the car.
       However, there was a shiny metallic object (wrench?) that may have been what the
       officers mistook for a gun.

       The chief is prepared to support a full investigation and let the chips fall where they may.
        She is worried that the reaction to the incident may endanger her anti-gang traffic stop
       program, which she believes has been crucial to bringing down crime. Her community
       meetings over the last few years have convinced her that the public broadly supports this
       program. The mayor and chief of police will hold a press conference in two hours.

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion



        HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION #3:

               A new police chief has been hired and the local paper published a series of op-ed pieces
               discussing the issues that the new chief should address. In one, the editorial board called
               on the chief to move beyond the slogans of community policing to the real spirit of
               community policing: giving local communities, particularly communities of color, a real
               say in how the police serve them.
