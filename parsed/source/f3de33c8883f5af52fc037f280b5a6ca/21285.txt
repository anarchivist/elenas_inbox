Elena -- here are the paragraphs we discussed for you to put in your
longer memo to Erskine.  Elena/Chris -- I've put some related documents on
chairs.

Requiring States to Fund Priorities in Exchange for Medicaid Recoupment
Protection

        Protecting states from Medicaid recoupment is one of the National
Governors' Association's top three priorities for the remainder of the
Congressional session (the other two are expansion of the Ed-Flex
demonstration program and support for an Enzi-Sessions amendment regarding
Indian gaming).  On Thursday, a letter signed by every state attorney
general was sent to the House and Senate leadership stating their "strong
support for legislation that would protect tobacco litigation or
settlement recoveries from federal Medicaid recoupment claims."

        Governor Chiles is coming to see you on Tuesday to urge us to make
addressing this issue a top Administration priority for the upcoming
budget discussions.  His staff have told us that Chiles thinks we have
leverage to get states to agree to legislation that would provide
protection from recoupment only to states that agree to:

(1) Spend half their settlement funds on the menu of seven spending items
we negotiated with NGA for the McCain legislation (child care, child
welfare, maternal and child health block grant, substance abuse block
grant, safe and drug free schools program, Eisenhower education grants,
and state match for the children's health insurance program (limited to 6
percent of total)).

(2) Pay a pro-rata share of the CBO-scored costs of this provision.   For
example, a state that received 30 percent of the nation's tobacco
settlement funds in a given year would pay the federal government 30
percent of the CBO-estimated costs.  CBO currently projects $1.2 billion
in federal Medicaid recoveries over five years from state tobacco
settlements, and thus scores legislation protecting states from recoupment
as costing $1.2 billion.
·

Chiles' staff did not say that the NGA has agreed to the funding
restrictions outlined in (1), but simply that Chiles believes a majority
of states would accept such funding restrictions in exchange for
recoupment protections. All states have agreed to the payment mechanism
outlined in (2).

Chiles apparently wants a deal this year because 1) he fears HCFA's
efforts to recoup Florida's funds, even if ultimately unsuccessful, will
delay implementation of his anti-tobacco program; and 2) he thinks given
the promising negotiations now underway between the states and the
industry, CBO's January baseline will score the cost of this provision
even higher than $1.2 billion, making it harder to maintain state
agreement on the payment mechanism.
