TEXT:
FYI, We -- obviously -- are very interested in these, if you all decide
not to go with them.    If you are looking for a POTUS date, we are going to
be in CA on 11/12 and could do an event with Davis and the VP with the CA
grants as the news ....

Keep us in mind and let me know if this sounds possible.

THANKS.
