MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:              Talking Points for Telephone Calls to Senators Lugar & Ford re: Tobacco
                      Bill Fanner Provision


Current Status
        Senators Lugar and Ford have competing provisions relating to farmers that are each
included in the tobacco bill. Senator Lugar's measure would end the tobacco program within 3
years and buy-out farmers at a cost of$18 billion over those three years. Senator Ford's
measure would continue the tobacco program, giving farmers the option of being bought out. It
costs $28.5 billion, but the cost is spread over 25 years. Late Tuesday, Senator Ford offered a
motion to strike the Lugar provision from the bill and that motion is currently pending.

        Senator Ford has previously communicated a possible compromise to Lugar: Ford would
be willing to end the program in 15 years, offer the states the opportunity to institute state or
regionally-run programs, scale back the cost of his program to $22.5 billion, and accelerate
payments to farmers as much is practicable. Senator Lugar said he did not want to accept a
provision that would continue a production control program, even at a state level, unless there
was a parallel free market that farmers could choose. This is unacceptable to Senator Ford who
believes a free market, cannot coexist with price controls. Senator McConnell has allied himself
with Lugar, and has promised Kentucky voters that the $18 billion will be forthcoming in three
years. The continuation of the program and the speed of the payments are the key issues to
resolve.

Talking Points for Call to Senator Lugar

*      I know that you are deeply concerned about youth smoking and that you want the
       Congress to pass a comprehensive bill that will really do something about this problem.

*      I also know that you have strong and principled views about the farmers piece of this
       legislation and that you have worked hard on a proposal to protect tobacco farmers, while
       moving toward a free market system.

*      The problem now is that the farmers issue could hold up the whole bill. I think we need
       to reach a compromise on this issue, so it is not divisive and does not give some senators
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
       a way to put the entire bill in jeopardy.

*      I understand that Senator Ford has suggested a possible compromise -- a proposal to
       terminate the program over a number of years, while permitting states to put some pricing
       measures in place on their own. I hope you will work with him to come up with a plan
       you both could accept.

*      If I or Secretary Glickman can be of any help in promoting a compromise approach, we
       would be very glad to do so. We all have a common interest in solving this problem and
       moving the bill forward.


Talking Points for Call to Senator Ford

*      I want to thank you for your work in crafting the LEAF Act and in trying to gain
       bipartisan support for the measure.

*      As you know, I have insisted that any comprehensive tobacco legislation protect tobacco
       farmers and their communities, and I have expressed strong support for your proposal.

*      I have just talked to Senator Lugar and urged him to move in your direction. We should
       be able to agree on an approach that keeps the federal program going for more than three
       years and allows states to pick up where the federal program leaves off.

*      I'd like you to work with Lugar to fashion a compromise. I think we can reach a
       compromise that will protect farmers and will be politically acceptable to you. We
       shouldn't let the Republicans use the farmers issue to kill legislation that they don't like
       for other reasons. If Secretary Glickman or I can assist you in any way, you should let us
       know immediately.
