TEXT:
Elena,
Beverly Barnes and the PIR folks are putting together a set of q&a for the
President's PBS roundtable to be taped on July 8th. They are trying to
finalize them by the end of the day on Wed.  I will send you a draft of
those questions that deal with policy as soon as I have them.  Thanks.

Julie
