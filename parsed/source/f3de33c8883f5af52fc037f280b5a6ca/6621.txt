TEXT:
BR/EK:

I understand that the House will consider a resolution tomorrow condemning
marijuana use, and that we -- by way of ONDCP -- will send up a supportive
letter. Two questions:

1. Should we be making a tobacco point here? For instance, we could say
that more kids use/die from tobacco; that kids who don't smoke cigarattes
are less likely to use marijuana and other more serious drugs; that
Congress should be acting on both issues at the same time.

2. Assuming that the resolution will be used to criticize us, shouldn't
we be saying -- as in the crack letter -- that although we support and
appreciate the resolution, Congress should focus on passing our drug
strategy, juvenile crime bill and tobacco legislation.  I admit, however,
that I have little hope of getting ONDCP to change their letter. But
perhaps this plays into tobacco politics for Thursday or into the
President's public comments tomorrow.

Just a thought ... let me know if you have any feedback.
Jose'
