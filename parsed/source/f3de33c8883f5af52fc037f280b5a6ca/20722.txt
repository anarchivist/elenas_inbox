TEXT:
This is a reminder that comments on the Justice testimony opposing HR4049,
Regulatory Fair Warning Act, are due at 10:00 this morning.  (See LRM
MJG298)  Thank you.

The bill would require that an agency give a regulated community adequate
notice of its interpretation of an ambiguous rule. Agencies and courts
would be barred from imposing penalties based on rules or policies that
are not clearly known to the regulated community.  Specifically, it would
prohibit a civil or criminal sanction from being imposed by an agency or
court if: a rule or regulation is not available to the public or known to
the regulated community; a rule or regulation does not give fair warning
of what is prohibited or required; or officials have been misleading about
what a rule prohibits/requires.
