TEXT:
fyi - Senator Kennedy is dropping his bill on after-school on Monday.   It
has $5 billion over 5 for CCDBG (through a new title), $1 billion over 5
for 21st Century Learning Centers, and $1.25 over 5 for some kind of crime
prevention fund.  He only has Democratic cosponsors so far - Boxer, Kerry,
Wellstone, etc - and they're waiting to see if Dodd will join. They of
course want our support for their bill.
