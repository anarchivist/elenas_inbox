 PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
 REMARKS ON MOVIE RATINGS ENFORCEMENT
 THE ROOSEVELT ROOM
 June 8, 1999

 Now, r hope it wonO,t confuse anybody when r say that r just met with
 representatives of NATO and we talked about the movies.

 rO,m referring, of course, to a somewhat different O&NAT008 than usual 0) this
 time, rO,m talking about the National Association of Theatre Owners.  We
 did have a very good discussion.  I spoke with NATO President Bill
 Kartozian and his colleagues about the ways creative and committed people
 are working together to prevent youth violence, and the ways the theatre
 industry in particular is stepping up to its responsibility.

         It was not even two months ago that the tragedy at Columbine High
 School seared itself into our national consciousness.  But ever since that
 day we have, I think, moved surely and steadily toward the kind of future
 we want for our country.  People from all walks of life are corning
 together in a national grassroots campaign to prevent youth violence and
 to give our young people the safe childhoods they deserve.

         We all know that parents are the first and most important
 influence on a child.  But we also know that the demands on parents are
 increasing. As more and more parents work outside the horne, they have
 less and less time for their children.  Parents in the average family now
 have 22 fewer hours each week to spend at horne than parents did a


 generation ago.

         since my first days as President we have worked hard to help
 parents balance horne and work. One of the ways weO,ve done that is by
 giving parents better tools to make immediate but informed judgments 0)
 about the shows their kids watch, the music they hear, and the video games
 they play. We have worked hard to give parents new tools like the V-Chip,
 which, by the end of next month, will be in every new television set sold
 in America, and will help parents block violent programming from their
 living rooms. WeO,ve also made progress on parental screening for the
 Internet and ratings for Internet game sites.

         But for ratings systems to work, the ratings must be accurate; and
 they must not be undercut by the industries that apply them.  That is why,
 last week, I asked the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
 Commission to study the extent to which the video game, music and movie
 industries market violence to children 0) and whether those industries are
 abiding by their own voluntary systems of regulation.  Children must not
 be targets in the marketing of violence.

 For ratings systems to work, they must also be enforced. Not just by
 watchful parents, but by retailers at the point of sale, and by theatre
 owners at the multiplex. Still, too often, children are making it past
 the ticket counter 0) underage, unescorted, and unquestioned.  And too
 often, people have chosen to look away rather than turn these children
 away.

 But today, I am pleased to announce that a powerful group has agreed to
 draw the line at the theatre doors.  By checking IDs for O&R08-rated movies,
 theatre owners will now make the O&R08 rating mean what it is supposed to
 mean: O&Restricted.08 No one under 17 admitted without a parent or
 guardian. No exceptions. No excuses.

 Last week, when I challenged theatre owners to step up to their
 responsibility, I could only have hoped they would respond so quickly or
 resoundingly.  I want to applaud Bill Kartozian and his organization.  I
 also want to thank Senators [Hatch and Leahy] for the work they have done
 on this issue.

  [AS I have said, there are others who must step up to their responsibility
 0) for the sake and the safety of our children.   This week, the House
 Judiciary Committee will take up important legislation, already passed by
 the Senate, to help prevent youth violence.   This includes common-sense
 measures that close the deadly gun-show loophole; require that safety
 locks be sold with every handgun; ban the importation of large-capacity
 ammunition clips; and ban violent juveniles from owning guns as adults.]

  [I strongly urge the House not to riddle this legislation with loopholes.
 They should act to pass it into law 0) and should act quickly.   There is no
 call or excuse for delay.   Every day of delay is another day for the NRA
 to muscle Members of Congres~ into killing a good bill.   In recent days,
 the NRA has fought to defy the growing consensus for common-sense gun
 laws, and to defend the indefensible idea that criminals should be able to
 buy guns at gun shows, no questions asked.   The gun lobby is also trying
 to muzzle gun representatives who came here a month ago and supported our
 proposals. Let me be clear: those representatives of the gun industry
 took a stand for what is right.   They should be singled out for praise,
 not targeted for retribution.]

 I strongly hope the Congress will resist the pressure tactics of the gun


lobby and step up to its responsibility.  In our great national effort to
prevent youth violence, none of us can stand aside, and none of us should
stand in the way. Our national campaign is gathering members and gaining
momentum.  I think todayD,s commitment by the theatre owners demonstrates
that plainly. And in the weeks and months ahead, I believe we will
continue to move forward as one nation, striving together to build a
better future for all our children. Thank you.
