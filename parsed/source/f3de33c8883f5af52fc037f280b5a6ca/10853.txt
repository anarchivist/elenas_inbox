     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
     REMARKS ON WELFARE-TO-WORK INITIATIVES
     THE WHITE HOUSE
     January 25, 1999

             Acknowledgments: Secs. Cuomo TBD, Herman, Shalala, Slater; Janice LaChance
     , Dir. of OPM; Aida Alvarez, Administrator of SBA; Gov. Mel Carnahan;
     father TBD; Fleet National Bank COO TBD

              This new year, 1999, is just about my twentieth year of work on
     the welfare issue. As governor, I used to invite welfare recipients to
     talk to me and other governors about their experiences, and about the
     difference that work -- something as basic as a full-time job -- could
     make in their lives. We had to take their word for it, back then, because
     there were not many success stories of the transition from
     welfare-to-work.   Welfare, as it existed then, seemed to promote
     dependence rather than independence.   It seemed, to many Americans, to
     reward the wrong attitude while punishing the right one. Welfare wasnD,t
     working; and, it almost went without saying, welfare recipients werenD,t
     working.

             In the past six years we have done much to change all that.  When
     I became President, I worked with 43 states to craft their own programs to
     move Americans from welfare to work; and, in 1996, I signed the landmark
     bipartisan welfare reform law, ending the old system as we knew it.  I
     said then that D&our nationD,s answer to the problems of poverty will no
     longer be a never-ending cycle of welfare; it will be the dignity, the
,>




     power, and the ethic of work.DS

             Today, already, even our greatest hopes are being surpassed.
     Welfare rolls are the smallest in 30 years, down by 44 percent since I
     took office.  More single parents are joining the workforce.  Meanwhile,
     more welfare recipients are working than ever before; the number has
     tripled since 1992, and 1.5 million who were on welfare in 1997 were
     working in 1998.

             The welfare system is no longer holding people back, it is moving
     them ahead, to a better future.  welfare reform alone did not achieve
     that; more was required of us, and that is why have continued to support
     health care and child care for low-income families.  That is why, back in
     1993, we doubled the Earned Income Tax Credit, a targeted tax cut that is
     especially generous to low-income working families.  For a family of four
     with an annual income of less than $30,000, that tax cut is worth about
     $1,000.

              I have said that if we are going to require able-bodied people to
     take jobs, we have to make sure as a nation that there are jobs for them
     to take.   In our strong and growing economy, the true engine of job growth
     is the private sector.   Two years ago, I asked five companies to lead a
     national effort to hire people off welfare. Tonight, our Welfare to Work
     Partnership includes 10,000 companies who have hired hundreds of thousands
     of people.   WeD,ve heard some of those success stories this morning; and I
     know, between Eli Segal and companies like Fleet, we will be hearing many
     more in the years to come.

             Smaller caseloads and bigger paychecks are important signs of
     progress. But they are not the only ones. The sense of pride, the sense
     of security of newly working Americans -- these are the best measures of
     our success. As more Americans gain the confidence that a full-time job
     can bring, we gain confidence that our new strategy is working and
     strengthen our determination to do more.

             We know what works.  Now we must ensure that it continues to do
     so.  In my State of the Union Address last week, I said we can help
     another 200,000 Americans move from welfare to work.   To achieve that
     goal, I propose that we renew the successful Welfare-to-Work program,
     which is set to expire in the year 2000.  My balanced budget includes $1
     billion to help states and communities build upon their record of success,
     to turn more long-term welfare recipients into full-time workers.

             Of that $1 billion in new funds, we will dedicate $150 million to
     low-income fathers who fulfill their duty to work, to pay child support,
     and to become part of their childrenD,s lives again.  Every father has
     that responsibility to his children and the mother of his children. And
     if every father paid the support they should, [TK] million women would go
     off the welfare rolls immediately. But some fathers have difficulty
     getting a job, and that is why many states are using some of their
     Welfare-to-work funds to help committed fathers of children on welfare
     fathers who sign personal responsibility contracts -- to get jobs. My
     balanced budget will help ensure every state can support fathers who
     support their families.

             There is more we must do. Welfare recipients who remain on the
     rolls, in many cases, face the greatest challenges to entering the
     workforce.  We know that if you canD,t get to work, you canD,t go to
     work. Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, but three-quarters of
     welfare recipients live in cities or rural areas. Most donD,t own cars


and public transportation isno,t much help when youo,re working nights or
weekends.  That is why my balanced budget will double funding to get
workers to the workplace.  I am also announcing a 50 percent increase in
housing vouchers -- to help families find affordable homes, avoid those
difficult commutes, and to get them closer to a new job and a better,
brighter future.

         Thanks to the efforts of companies like Fleet, officials like
Governor Carnahan, and working Americans like [TK] , more families are
enjoying that kind of future.   I urge Congress to renew an investment that
is expanding opportunity and rewarding responsibility for millions of
Americans.   If we do so, we will continue to make good on what I called,
two years ago, o&a historic chance to make welfare what it was meant to
be: a second chance, not a way of life.oS We will go farther toward
fulfilling our nationo,s basic bargain -- to reward the hard work of its
citizens, and to give them the tools to succeed in changing and exciting
times. Thank you.
