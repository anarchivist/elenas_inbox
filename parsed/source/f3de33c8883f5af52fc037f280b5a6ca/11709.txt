TEXT:
I meet w/ folks from CEDA -- in Illinois --for John -- they were very
appreciative of the President's support for CBSG   but asked that we
consider funding discretionary programs and they were upset that we did
not fund CDBG ---   I listened and then talked POTUs agenda etc -- but had
no response to these two items -- I should have invited someone from DPC
who actually knows the answers --- but it was a last minute meeting ---
anyway --this is a long way of asking --- can someone give me the talking
points on CBSG and CDBG -- discretionary accounts --- if you have them --
please don't go to any extra effort -- I made it thru the meeting -- just
fine.  thanks
