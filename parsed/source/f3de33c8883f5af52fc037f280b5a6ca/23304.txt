Subject:         OPD SERVER UPGRADE (text for message)

IS&T needs to upgrade the OPD server this Saturday from 8pm until Sunday
at 8am in preparation for the NT 4.0 roll-out which begins next week and
for the Y2K effort.  This upgrade must take place this weekend.  Please
let me know if there are any serious conflicts with doing this upgrade.
If there are, we may have to schedule it for one night this week. Thank
you for your cooperation.

The process to upgrade the OPD server will begin Saturday evening, April
3rd, starting at 8 p.m.   This step is in anticipation of the NT4 rollout
and to assure Y2K compliancy.   It is expected this task will be completed
by 8 a.m. Sunday morning.   During this upgrade period, you will not be
able to access any applications running off the server, including Lotus
Notes e-mail, nor will you be able to print to any networked printers
(local printers are not affected) .

If you need to access WordPerfect (which runs off your PC), boot up and
log on with your password as usual. You will then receive an error
  ,                                                                         Page 3 of 3


message:    "Cannot find file 'Q:\STD\WINDOWS\RWIN\SERVER.EXE' specified
in the startup group (or one of its components); check to ensure the path
and filename are correct and that all required libraries are available,"
Click on the OK button that appears in this box and the message will clear
itself. Your desktop will then appear where you can select Word Perfect.
Again some of your desktop applications will NOT work since they are
executed off the server.

You are asked to please logoff and turn off your PC when departing Friday
evening or before the upgrade begins.

If you have any questions ....
