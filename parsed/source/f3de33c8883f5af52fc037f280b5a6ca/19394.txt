TEXT:
Tomorrow, we have two meetings scheduled with Wyden's staff (along with
Lautenberg and Durbin staff) to discuss international tobacco issues. The
first is at 11am on Doggett.  Peter Jacoby sees some value in USTR
handling this alone without DPC staff, because USTR appeared to be making
some progress on this subject with Wyden's staff around the time of the
markup.   At the same time, this would go against our policy of having DPC
staff attending all tobacco meetings.

Our second meeting with Wyden's staff is at 2:30 to discuss funding for
international tobacco efforts and the excise tax. We can always follow up
with them on Doggett at the 2:30 meeting if we do not attend the 11am
meeting.   Any thoughts on whether one of us needs to be at the 11am
meeting?
