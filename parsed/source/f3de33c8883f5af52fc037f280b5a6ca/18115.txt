Subject:         USCM Homelessness Survey

Following is some basic information on the report to give you an idea of
what they will release.  Emily and I will have a hard copy of the survey's
executive summary walked around to you.  Please remember that the
information is embargoed until Monday. We can provide you with more
detailed information on the survey if necessary.  You may contact me,
Emily, Lynn or Mona.

Mayor Riley of Charleston, SC, and Secretary Cuomo will hold a press
conference, Monday, December 15, at 10:30 am, to release the U. S.
Conference of Mayors (USCM) 13th Annual Survey on Hunger and Homelessness
in U.S. Cities. The survey reports information taken from 29 major
cities.  It shows that over the past year, requests for emergency food and
emergency shelter have increased and that a significant amount of the
cities' emergency food assistance centers and emergency shelters turn
people away.  The survey shows that the strong economy has had little or
no effect on either hunger or homelessness:  low-paying jobs lead the list
of causes of hunger identified by the city officials; requests for
assisted housing by low income families and individuals increased in


three-fourths of the cities. The report shows that city officials believe
welfare reform will have a greater effect on low-income people than the
economy in the coming years, and that while there may be additional
services; or funding for them, available, it will not be enough to meet
the increasing need.
