TEXT:
The attached is agenciese for they have some good numbers on salmonella
and they want to do the announcement themselves.    I think the Council
should do it along with our document replying to the NAS perhaps.

Subject: Food Safety - possible Announcement by a Principal

As you know the President's FSI supported development of the FoodNet
system,
and it completed its third year of surveillance in 1998.   (FSIS contributed
funding and some technical support to CDC for this effort.)

We are pleased that CDC has informed us that they wish to make a joint
press
release with Food Safety of USDA next week to announce comparisons of food
borne illness data from five original FoodNet sites over a three year
period.
They will report a significant decrease in bacterial pathogen specific
rates
in cases of infection caused by Salmonella, and a pronounced drop for
serotype
Enteritidis. They will also show a decline in rates of infection from
Campylobacter.

Results for some other pathogens are either unchanged over the three year
period, or in some cases there are increases.

We understand that CDC will probably attribute the decline to several
causes,
among them FSIS' Pathogen Reduction Program and HACCP implementation,
because
these programs include production process controls, standard sanitation
procedures and USDA and plant microbial testing which is designed to reduce


food borne illness in food processing plants.

The Under Secretary for Food Safety (USDA), Cathie Woteki,  FDA
Commissioner
Henney and CDC Director Koplan will testify at the Senate Appropriations
hearing on food safety * concentrating on the President's initiative * the
week following this joint announcement (March 16.)

We believe this announcement may be an opportunity for the President to
highlight the cooperative effort, solid results emanating from his
initiative
and future directions for food safety.

I tried today to contact Jim O'Hara at HHS,  but was unable to reach him.
FSIS and CDC public affairs staffs are discussing the joint release.

Please let me know what you think about involvement from your perspective.
