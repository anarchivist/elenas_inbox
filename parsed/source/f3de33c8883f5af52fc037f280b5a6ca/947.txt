Can we find this out for Carol? It's ridiculous that someone is donating
a million books and she doesn't know.

Subject: Newsweek and commitments to America Reads

     Pauline told me of your inquiry about Newsweek printing the
Scholastic
     figure.   As I shared with her, the commitments being made to the
     Summit are not on the whole being shared with us nor any agency as
     best I can tell.   I am working hard to have a smooth working
operation
     with the Corporation on America Reads and feel success is in place on
     that front.   However, the Summit is not something we work on daily
     together.   I have suggested periodically with them we need to be kept
     abreast of what is happening with the Summit and quite frankly I get
     the impression at times that those at the Corporation itself aren't
     always aware of what commitments are being received.   If you have
     ideas about what I should do differently let me know.   I think it is
a
     bigger system problem than just America Reads being somewhat in the
     dark as I have heard other departments/agencies saying they are
     getting calls from folks with whom they work saying they are confused
     about the relationship of the Summit to ongoing relationships with
     various agencies and departments with which they work.
