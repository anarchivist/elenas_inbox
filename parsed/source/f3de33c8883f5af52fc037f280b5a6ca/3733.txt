TEXT:
For some weird reason, HHS has developed a preliminary NPR "reinvention"
goal for successful welfare reform that differs from the President's goal
of moving 1 million people from welfare to work by the year 2000.
Instead, HHS's preliminary paper says that their-goal is to move "1.25
million welfare recipients into new employment within the first two years
of welfare reform." The VP is actually having a meeting on Monday with 15
agencies, including ACF, to go over these preliminary goals. Not clear
what NPR's public release schedule is.

We are inclined to call Olivia and NPR leaders and tell them that this is
not appropriate, and it's hard to envision any circumstance where we would
want HHS to have a different goal than the President, but wanted to make
sure you agree.
