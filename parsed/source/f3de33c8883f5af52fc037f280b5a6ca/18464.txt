Q.   How do you respond to critics of the Medicare buy-in proposal who charge that it is
     not and cannot be self-financing?

A:   We simply do not believe they understand the policy.

     First of all, the President's proposal explicitly would direct the Medicare actuary to
     set premiums at levels necessary to pay for the cost of this program. Unlike any
     other previous changes to the Medicare program, this policy asks the people
     benefiting to pay for the costs associated with this coverage. Each year, the actuary
     would be required to adjust those premiums to reflect actual experience to ensure
     that they are sufficient to offset costs. [This is the same career actuary whose
     projections about the financial status of Medicare are relied upon by Medicare's
     Trustees, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have full confidence that his
     estimates are sound.]

     Second, from the beginning, we have acknowledged --and paid for -- any up-front
     costs associated with this proposal. The day the President announced the proposal
     we laid out the $2 billion cost that was associated with this proposal. We also
     committed to completely offset these costs through a package of fraud, waste and
     abuse initiatives that will be included in the President's budget proposal.

     Follow Up:    If this is self-financed, why is there any cost associated with this
                   proposal?

     A.            To ensure that the premium is affordable, we designed the 62-65
                   buy-in proposal so that there were two premium payments. Since the
                   second premium is not paid until age 65, there is a short-term "loan"
                   to participants to cover this cost. It is paid back, with interest, by the
                   participants and the temporary cost is completely offset by anti-fraud,
                   waste and abuse savings.

                   BACKGROUND: The first premium payment, about $300, reflects
                   the average cost of this age group and would be paid monthly before
                   participants turn 65. The second premium, about $15 per month per
                   year for each year participants enrolled in Medicare before age 65,
                   would be paid at the time of Medicare eligibility (at age 65). This
                   amount offsets the additional costs resulting from the fact that
                   participants are expected to be sicker than average.
