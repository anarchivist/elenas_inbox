TEXT:
EK:

I have three comments on the NSC draft:

(l) Shouldn't OMB be on the memo? There one of the most impacted parties,
yet their concerns -- $ for SWB plan -- are not reflected in the memo.

(2) Making WH and agency concerns clearer. NSC makes the memo sound like
we have no concerns and DOJ/Treasury only have minor issues ("are not yet
on board"). We should be honest with President about the serious issues
at stake here -- especially since 3 of his toughest cabinet members are
not in agreement.  I suggest we change the first two sentences in the 2nd
paragraph to something along the lines of:

"Though we are sympathetic toward the basic thrust of Barry's proposal for
strengthened border coordination, we have concerns with his call for a new
Senate-confirmed border coordinator and for a three-fold increase in the
size of the Border Patrol (from less than 7,000 to more than 20,000).
Justice and Treasury have additional concerns, and are very unhappy that
Barry shared his proposal with the press and Congress before reaching
consensus within the Administration'."

(3) Working w/all of the WH. While I'm all for NSC taking the lead in
coordinating this decision, shouldn't we preserve our final say on this
matter by getting NSC and McCaffrey to agree to work with all WH folks in
preparing a decision memo for the President. Maybe we propose changing
the final line in the memo to read:

"Barry and Sandy have agreed to coordinate working a decision package to
you, working with the relevant White House agencies, that addresses all
unresolved issues and reflects all interested agency viewpoints."
