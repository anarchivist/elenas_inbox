                              STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT ON
                                THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                        March 17, 1999


    Today, the Congress is beginning its first mark up on patients' rights legislation. I am pleased
    that we are moving forward this issue that is critical to assuring Americans high quality health
    care. Unfortunately, the Chairman's mark appears to fall far short of providing patients with the
    protections they need.

    First, the current legislation only applies these rights to those in self-insured plans. This
    approach leaves 100 million Americans without the guarantee of critical protections. While
    these Americans may be protected by state laws, not one state has passed all of these protections.
     Moreover, as many as thirty states have not passed continuity of care protections to assure that
    patients do not have to change doctors in the middle of a critical treatment such as cancer or a
    pregnancy and more than twenty have not passed any type of provisions giving patients access to
    specialists. Patients should not be left vulnerable by a patchwork of protections. We need
    strong Federal legislation to assure all health plans provide patients these important rights.

    Moreover, the Chairman's mark also leaves out many of the most fundamental protections. For
    example, it does not have an adequate enforcement mechanism to assure patients are
    compensated when they are injured or die as a result of a health plans' decisions; it does not
    assure patients access to specialists, such as oncologists or heart specialists; and it leaves out
    continuity of care protections. That is why every major patient, doctor, and nurse advocacy
    organization has concluded that the Chairman's mark is simply inadequate.

    Today represents the first test of this new Congress to see if it is serious about providing
    Americans with a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights to assure high quality health
    care. I urge the Committee to do everything it can to pass this test and give Americans the
    protections they need.
