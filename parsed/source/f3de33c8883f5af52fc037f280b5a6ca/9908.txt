TEXT:
The VP is doing a domestic violence event on Wednesday. He is going to be
announcing that the Social Security Administration is going to make it
easier for victims of domestic violence to change their SSN's.  In
addition, he is going to announce a directive to OPM to prepare a guide on
domestic violence.  OPM is working on the directive, and I will get it to
you to review as soon as possible.  Phil Caplan says he needs it by
tomorrow am. Thanks, Mary
