PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON

REMARKS ON SENATE GUN LEGISLATION

THE WHITE HOUSE

May 14, 1999



           It is now clear that the tragedy in Littleton has helped create a

broad, common sense consensus that we must act to keep guns out of the

hands

of criminals and away from our children.     The question is whether the

Congress will write that national vision into law 0) or seek to block it.

Thus far, the answer given by the Senate is not promising.



           I am pleased that on Wednesday, a bipartisan majority in the

Senate

backed two important measures I introduced [two] weeks ago.      First, they

agreed to ban the import of high capacity ammunition clips that are used

to

evade the 1994 ban on assault weapons.     Second, they agreed to ban

juvenile

possession of semi-automatic assault rifles and large capacity magazines



weapons designed only for mayhem.      There is no good reason for a child to

own an AK-47.     And there is no good reason for anyone to use a 15 round

ammo

clip.



           I applaud the Senate for taking these two steps.   However, on

Wednesday, a narrow Republican majority squandered an important

opportunity

to close the gun-show loophole through which tens of thousands of guns are


sold each year without background checks.     Yesterday, I called on the

Senate

to reconsider this vote.     It makes absolutely no sense to let criminals

continue to use legitimate gun shows as a convenience store for their

weapons.



           Today, the Senate will vote again on a measure purporting to

address

this issue.     But the Senate Republican is riddled with high caliber

loopholes.     It won't stop criminals from buying guns at gun shows.     And at

the same time, it will let them buy guns at their local pawn shop.        That's

worse than current law.     I simply cannot believe that the Senate is going

to

make the same mistake twice.     So, once again, I calion the Senate to

reject

this phony proposal and to pass real legislation that prevents criminals

from

buying guns at gun shows.



           This should be a moment for national unity.   I was very pleased

today

to receive a letter from the major gun manufacturers supporting our

efforts

to pass a real, enforceable, mandatory background checks at gun shows.

They

recognize that law abiding citizens don't need a gun show loophole; only

criminals do.



           For six years, America has made strong and steady progress in the

fight against crime.     We have done so by elevating results over ideology.


Today, we have a chance to put aside the partisanship, political

divisions,

and raw special interest power that has dominated the debate on guns for

so

long.   For the sake of our children, I hope the Senate changes its mind

and

takes strong action to keep guns out of the wrong hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ATTACHM
