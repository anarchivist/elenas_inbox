TEXT:
An old friend from Coke called me today to say they were considering a big
education commitment to the summit, possibly on America Reads, and would
like to coordinate it with one of our events.   She's going to call me
later in the week when they're sure what they want to do.   I don't know if
they could have it ready for Saturday, but it would be a great thing for
us sometime between now and the summit.   (Don't tell them yet.)
