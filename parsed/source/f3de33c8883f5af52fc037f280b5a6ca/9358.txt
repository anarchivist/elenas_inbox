       TEXT:
       Because of the President's travel/weekend schedule, we'd like to ask that
       all offices submit weekly reports before tomorrow morning (i.e.,sometime
       this evening) so that the President can have time to see them early
       tomorrow.  Thanks for your help; please let me know if this'll be a
       problem.
