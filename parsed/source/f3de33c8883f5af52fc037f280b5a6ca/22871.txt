TEXT:
Just a heads up that if you haven't already taiked to Pat Ewing, she's
likely to call one of you -- I talked to Jodi Sakol, their press person,
who made it sound like Pat wasn't clear whether we or they would be
leaking and she'd probably have issues w/ us doing it.  I clarified to
Jodi that our intent was to do the leak as a preview for the VP event,
that we'll coordinate closely etc.  She also mentioned they'd be thrilled
w/ a NYT story.
