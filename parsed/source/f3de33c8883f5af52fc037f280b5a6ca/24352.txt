                    DRAFT TRANSMITTAL LETTER FROM SECRETARY
                            HERMAN TO THE CONGRESS

        I enclose for the consideration of the Congress a draft bill entitled the "Trade Adjustment

Assistance Reform Act of 1998." By combining the best features of the existing Trade

Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance

(NAFTA-TAA) programs into a consolidated T AA program, this draft bill would provide

effective, comprehensive assistance to workers adversely affected by international trade.

        This legislation follows through and expands upon the commitment made by the

President last fall to improve and expand Trade Adjustment Assistance to workers. The draft

bill would authorize the consolidated T AA program for five years, through fiscal year 2003.

The consolidated program would expand eligibility to workers who lose their jobs due to shifts in

production by their firm to other countries. Currently, T AA eligibility is restricted to workers

adversely affected by imports and NAFTA-T AA is limited to workers adversely affected by

imports from or shifts in production to Mexico or Canada. This expanded eligibility will

ensure comprehensive assistance is available to workers who lose their jobs due to imports from

or shifts in production to any foreign country.

        The bill also ensures that re(ij:l:lires the immediate pFOvisisa sf rapid response and basic

readjustment services will be made available to workers upon the filing of a petition for T AA

eligibility. These services are critical to facilitating rapid reemployment of workers and provide

important information to those workers relating to the resources available at the Federal, State

and local level to assist them. In addition, the legislation requires a one-third reduction in the

                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

time period for the Department of Labor to process petitions for certification of eligibility under

T AA; increases the annual cap on training expenditures to $150 million; and provides

contingency funds should the program exhaust appropriated funds in any fiscal year.

        The draft bill also harmonizes the differing rules of the programs relating to requiring

enrollment in training as a condition for receiving income support. These rules would retain the

program's emphasis on linking income support to training while allowing specified, limited

exceptions where appropriate to assist certain workers. In addition, the bill would assist workers

by expanding the period for scheduled breaks in a training program during which a worker may

continue to receive income support.

        The draft bill also contains provisions enhancing coordination between the consolidated

T AA program and the dislocated worker program under the Job Training Partnership Act

(JTP A). In particular, the bill would significantly enhance the accountability of the consolidated

program by ensuring that T AA and the dislocated worker program have common performance

outcome measures and information, which would include information on the placement in

employment, eamings (including wage replacement) and retention in employment of participants.

 The bill would also require coordination to ensure workers have access to employment-related

services available in one-stop career centers and would authorize the use of funds to provide

supportive services. Finally, the bill assures that information will eeHtiffile te be collected and

maintained identifying the countries to which production is shifted and erfrom which articles are

imported that result in certifications and the number of certifications relating to each country.

This will include information on the number of certifications relating to imports from or shifts in

products to Mexico or Canada, which will assist in making eligibility determinations under


                                                  2
                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

related NAFTA programs and in assessing the adequacy of the consolidated program. This

consolidation of the existing programs would therefore result in a program that responds to the

needs of workers adversely affected by trade in a more rapid, comprehensive, and accountable

manner.

         It should be noted that this legislation would build on administrative efforts already

undertaken by the Department to improve the programs. In addition, the legislation would be

supplemented by the Administration's commitment to make funds available under the National

Reserve Account in the JTP A dislocated worker program to address the needs of workers in

firms that are secondarily affected by international trade -- that is suppliers to directly affected

firms and assemblers and final processors of articles . produced by such firms. These workers

would be eligible to receive the same assistance available to workers under the consolidated

TAA program.

         Together, these reforms would provide critical assistance to help workers who lose their

jobs due to international trade to obtain reemployment and would help to ensure that all

Americans can benefit from economic change.

         In addition, at the request of the Department of Commerce, the draft bill includes a

provision extending for the same five year period the trade adjustment assistance for firms

program administered by that Department under chapter 3 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974.

      I urge the Congress to give the draft bill prompt and favorable consideration.

                       SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE TAA

                     AND NAFTA-TAA CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 1998




       Section 1 provides that the short title of the Act is the "Trade Adjustment Assistance

Refonn Act of 1998".

       Section 2 contains the authorization for the consolidated Trade Adjustment Assistance

(TAA) program.

       Section 2(a) authorizes such sums as may be necessary to be appropriated to the

Department of Labor to carry out the program for each of the five succeeding fiscal years -- FY

1999 through FY 2003.

        Section 2(b) provides a tennination date for assistance under the consolidated program

and for the trade adjustment assistance for finns administered by the Department of Commerce

of September 30,2003.

        Section 2(c) repeals the NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance (NAFTA-TAA)

program.

        Section 3 relates to the filing of petitions and the provision of rapid response assistance

by the States.


                                                 15
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

       Section 3(a) provides that a petition for certification of eligibility to apply for assistance is

to be filed by a group of workers or by their union or other representative with the Governor of

the State in which the workers' firm is located. The other representatives who may file the

petition on behalf of the workers include entities such as the workers' firm, the State dislocated

worker unit, other State agencies, and one-stop career centers. The Governor is to immediately

transmit the petition to the Secretary of Labor; ensure that rapid response assistance and basic

readjustment services authorized under other Federal law are made available to workers covered

by the petition; and assist the Secretary in reviewing the petition by verifying information and

providing such other assistance as the Secretary may request. The Secretary is to publish a

notice in the Federal Register upon receipt of an petition that an investigation has been initiated.

This provision is a hybrid ofthe current petition procedures under the two programs. Currently

under T AA the petition is filed with the Secretary rather than the State and there is no

requirement that the State provide appropriate rapid response services. Rapid response

assistance and basic readjustment services provide critical information and services that can

often facilitate coordinated planning and more rapid reemployment for affected workers.

Therefore, it is essential that this assistance be included in the consolidated program. Currently,

under NAFTA-T AA the petition is filed with the Governor, who has ten days to make a

preliminary determination of eligibility, and then transmits the petition to the Secretary for a final

determination. Rapid response assistance is required upon an affirmative finding. The

consolidated provision relieves the burden on the States of making a preliminary determination

and avoids unnecessary delay in the provision of rapid response assistance. Under the


                                                  16
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


consolidated provision, the State is also to provide such assistance in reviewing the petition as

the Secretary may request, which should assist in expediting the review process.

       Section 3(b) accelerates the time period in which the Secretary is to complete a review of

the petitions from the current 60 days after a petition is filed under T AA to 40 days after a

petition is filed under the consolidated program.

       Section 4 adds as a basis for eligibility under the consolidated TAA program job loss due

to the shift in production by the workers' firm to another country. Currently, TAA eligibility is

limited to workers who are adversely affected by imports. NAFTA-TAA eligibility is based on

workers already affected by imports from Mexico and Canada or a shift in production to either of

those two countries. The consolidated TAA program will base eligibility on workers adversely

affected by either imports from or shifts in production to any foreign country.
                                                                                                   .
       Specifically, the amended section 222(a) ofthe Trade Act of 1974 would provide that a

group of workers filing a petition will be eligible for assistance if the Secretary determines that a

significant number or proportion of the workers in the workers' firm or subdivision have become

separated, or are threatened with separation, and either: (1) the sales or production of the firm

have decreased absolutely, imports of articles like or directly competitive with the articles

produced by the firm or subdivision have increased, and the increase in imports contributed

importantly to the workers' separation and to the decline in sales or production by the workers'

firm, or (2) there has been a shift in production by the workers' firm or subdivision to a foreign

country of articles like or directly competitive with the articles produced by the firm or

subdivision.

       Section 5 would apply to the consolidated TAA program an enrollment in training


                                                 17
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

requirement for income support similar to the requirement that is currently included under

NAFT A-T AA. Under this requirement, in order to be eligible to receive income support under

the program while in training, a worker must be enrolled in training not later than either the last

day of 16th week of a worker's most recent total qualifying separation or the 8th week after a

certification of eligibility is issued. The Secretary may extend these periods by 45 days if there

are extenuating circumstances, such as a course is cancelled or the first available enrollment date

for a particular program is later. This requirement encourages workers to make training

decisions early in their spell of unemployment which will accelerate reemployment and enhance

the adjustment process.

        Section 6 specifies the conditions under which a waiver may be issued from the general

requirement that a worker be enrolled in training to receive income support. This provision is a

 hybrid between the TAA program, which provides general waiver authority where training is

deemed to be not "feasible or appropriate" for a worker, and NAFTA-TAA which does not allow

any waivers of the requirements.

        Specifically, the new provision allows a waiver under the following six conditions: (1)

the worker has been notified that the worker will be recalled to employment; (2) the worker has

marketable skills as determined pursuant to an assessment; (3) the worker is within two years of

qualifying for retirement benefits under the Social Security Act; (4) the worker is unable to

participate in training due to health (except this does not exempt the worker from available for

.work requirements otherwise applicable to the receipt of income support); (5) the first available

enrollment date is within 45 days; or (6) there are insufficient funds for training under the

chapter. The Secretary is to specify the duration of each waiver and periodically review the


                                                 18
                                                                              Hex-Dump C agement SystefTi
                                                                                         on versIOn
waiver to ensure the basis for granting it remains applicable to the worker.

        These requirement§ are intended to ensure that the primary purpose of income support

under the Act -- to assist workers while they are participating in training -- is maintained while

allowing for reasonable exceptions under certain circumstances.

        Section 7 would expand the period for which a worker may continue to receive income

support during breaks in training. Currently, a worker may not receive income support during a

break in training if the break exceeds 14 days. This imposes hardships on certain workers,

particularly over the winter holidays. In addition, since training is increasingly being provided

through community colleges and other institutions with breaks scheduled longer than 14 days,

this limitation will be increasingly problematic. The amendment would extend the

break-in-training period to 30 days, which would generally accommodate training institution

schedules while preserving the linkage of income support under the program to participation in

training.

        Section 8 would provide a training cap for the consolidated program of $150 million.

Currently, the cap for the TAA program is $80 million and the NAFTA-T AA is $30 million.

The increase is intended to address the expansion of eligibility due to shifts in production, an

expected increase in the programs take-up rate due to the Department's administrative efforts to

expand outreach, and to account for the reduction in the number of training waivers expected

under the revised rules.

        Section 9 would eliminate a quarterly report to the Congress on training expenditures.

The report appears to be of limited utility. The Department has been and will remain committed

to ensuring that Congress is fully informed regarding expenditures under the program, especially

where it is anticipated that the expenditures will reach the cap.

       Section 10 provides for expanded coordination between the consolidated TAA program

and the dislocated worker program administered under the Job Training Partnership Act.

Specifically, section lO(a) provides that the coordination is to include common reporting systems

and elements, including elements relating to participant data and performance outcomes. This

infermatien will signifieantly enhanee the aeeetlntability ef the eenseliaatea pre gram ana

facilitate enhanced cooperation between and assessments of the two programs.

       In addition, section 1O(b) provides that in ensuring workers are provided

employment·related services, the Secretary is to ensure such services include services at one-stop

career centers. These centers are being established throughout the country pursuant to

Department of Labor grants and will be an invaluable resource in providing information,

services, and referrals to TAA participants.

       Section 11 provides that the Secretary may authorize funds under this chapter to be used

to provide supportive services to enable eligible workers to participate in or complete training.

These services, such as transportation and child care, may be critical to facilitating a worker's

participation in training and are authorized under JTP A training programs. While as under

current law this provision retains a requirement that the Secretary attempt to arrange for the

provision of these services by other programs, it allows the Secretary to authorize the use of

funds under this chapter to provide these services where such attempts are unsuccessful.

        Section 12 provides that the agreement for administration of the program between the

State and the Secretary is to include a requirement that the State reports performance information

that the Secretary requests. At a minimum, this performance information is to include rates of


                                                 20
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

entered employment, wage replacement, and earnings and retention in employment six months

after termination from the program. These performance measures are consistent with JTP A and

will significantly enhance the accountability under the consolidated T AA program.

       Section 11 provides that contingency funds are to be made available to the consolidated

T AA program if appropriated funds are exhausted in any fiscal year. This provision does not

supersede and is subject to the $150 million cap on training expenditures. These funds are to be

made available from funds in the Treasury that are not otherwise appropriated and will ensure

that the commitment to provide assistance to adversely affected workers is not breached.

       Section 14 provides that the Secretary is to collect and maintain information identifying

the countries to which production is shifted and, to the extent feasible, from which articles are

imported that result in certifications under this chapter and in the number of certifications

relating to each such country. The provision qualifies the collection of information on imports

"to the extent feasible" because it is sometimes difficult to identify the primary source of

imported articles since such articles may have components produced in several different

countries or may be transshipped among countries.         These information collection requirements

will result in the availability of information relating to certfications based on shifts in production

to and imports from Mexico and Canada, which relatisg ta the RtlFRber af eertifieatiass issued

would be useful to the Congress and other policy makers in assessing the adequacy of the

consolidated program. It would also maintain a commitment to account for program activity

relating to trade with Mexico or Canada and would facilitate eligibility determinations for related

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

programs, such as the North American Development Bank and Community Adjustment and

Investment Program.

        Section 15 would authorize appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for fiscal

years 1999-2003 for trade adjustment assistance for firms under chapter 3 of title II ofthe Trade

Act of 1974, which is administered by the Department of Commerce. This authorization period

is consistent with the authorization period for trade adjustment assistance for workers under

chapter II that is provided in section 2 of this bill.

        Section lQ provides the effective date and transition provisions. Section 16(a) provides

that the provisions of the Act are to take effect on October 1, '1998. Section 16(b) authorizes the

Secretary to establish appropriate rules to facilitate or orderly transition from the separate T AA

and NAFTA-TAA programs to the consolidated program.
