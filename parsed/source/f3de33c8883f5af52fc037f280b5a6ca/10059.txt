TEXT:
Beginning next Monday, the President's Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS will
be having its regular meeting in Washington.  They are addressing a broad
range of issues, and have requested the participation of a number of
government officials.

We are not anticipating that their deliberations will provoke any
significant press response; however, the meetings are open to the public
so there is always an element of unpredictability.  Of course, we will let
you know immediately if any press activity is expected.

Part of their discussions will focus on their upcoming meeting with the
POTUS, scheduled for December 18th. We have asked that they work
carefully to identify those issues to which they expect the President to
respond, as well as the Council members presenting those issues.

Here is a quick summary of government officials (in no particular order)
and the issues to be discussed:

GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL      ISSUES COVERED
Sandra Thurman, Director
Office of National AIDS Policy Overview of Adminstration's HIV/AIDS


activities over the last three months.
Todd Summers, Deputy Director
Office of National AIDS Policy Incarcerated populations, treatment access,
and youth
Dr. Jeff Koplan
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention        Outline of his priorities as new
director, goals with respect to HIV/AIDS prevention, and activities to

Dr. David Satcher

implementation of the AIDS initiative recently announced by the President
Dr. Helene Gayle, Director

file for the detailed agenda for this meeting.
