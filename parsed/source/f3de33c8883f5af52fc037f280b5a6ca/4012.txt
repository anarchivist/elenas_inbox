  TEXT:
  OMB is ready to clear the definition of means tested benefits.
  (Background is attached if you're interested).

  In order to make sure we are OK with it, some or all of you will get a
  mysterious fax from Josh Gotbaum with an issue paper on the subject
  attached. The purpose of this is to give us a chance to speak now or
  forever hold our peace.  I think the new definition is sensible, and so
  you can do nothing.

  Subject: definition of means tested benefit and new child health program

 People have been looking into this question of whether we should
 reconsider our (tentative) definition of means tested benefits, such that
 it would exclude the new child health program.  Everyone has concluded or
 will probably conclude soon that we should give up on this. Apparently,
 there is some legal argument that you could exclude the new program, on
 the grounds that capped entitlements should be excluded. However, our
 opponents might argue that this clouds our big argument (the colloquy when
 the Byrd Rule knocked out a definition last year made an important
 mandatory/discretionary distinction) .


 Also, even if this logic were acceptable to OLC, the same logic would also
 let TANF off the hook -- and the only means tested programs we have
 defined in the entire government are SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, TANF, and
 probably now this new child health program. Taking TANF off the listt too
 would risk making Lamar Smith even madder than he is, such that he would
 mount a more serious legislative effort to get a much meaner definition
 into the law.  So there seems to be an emerging consensus that we are at t
 he end of the line on this -- HHS, Apfel, NEC, and I guess me too.  OMB is
 still checking with Josh Gotbaum, but I think he will agree. HHS will
 probably officially issue it next week, so let me know if you aren't ready
 to drop this.                                      .
