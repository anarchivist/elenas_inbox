TEXT:


We met with Daschle's staff yesterday, and they pretty much agreed to the
changes we proposed.  Attached is a draft of our proposed changes.   The
changes are essentially the following:

         1.       We are removing the data collection section (Sec. 4),
and replacing it with a Sense of the Senate to be placed at the end of the
bill that recognizes the need to collect data. This sense of the Senate
does not reference any particular agency, form, or method of collecting
the data.
         2.       The Department of Justice proposed some new language in
the Findings (Sec. 2)
         3.       The Federal Government will be exempt from punitive
damages.    Under Title VII and other fair employment statutes, punitive
damages are not available in actions against the United States.
         4.       Also we need to look into ways to reference funding, if
at all, in Section 8. Remember that Sec. 5 on training; Sec. 6 on
Research, Education, and Outreach; and Sec. 7 on the Award are still in
the bill. There is no proposed language drafted on this yet.     OMB could
you all provide some input on this.

We are supposed to provide any changes to Daschle's staff by COB today.
Please get any comments to me this afternoon.  If you do not have a copy
of the Daschle bill, please let me know and I can get you a copy.

FYI -- The event is tenatively scheduled for 2 p.m. on Thursday, April 2,
with the Vice President.  ==================== ATTACHMENT 1 ====================

                       Proposed Changes to Daschle's Bill on Pay Equity

Sec. 2. Findings

Para. (2): Revise to read, "Even in the 1990s, women earn significantly lower pay than men
for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are performed
under similar working conditions. These pay disparities exist in both the private and
governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay disparities can only be due to continued
intentional discrimination or the lingering effects of past discrimination."

Para. (3): Add a subparagraph reading, "in many instances, may deprive workers of equal
protection on the basis of sex in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments"

Para. (4)(B): Add two subparagraphs, "remedying the effects of past discrimination on the
basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are afforded equal protection on the
basis of sex" and "in the private sector, ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress'
power to enforce the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments"

Para. (5): Revise to read, "With increased information about the provisions added by the
Equal Pay Act of 1963 and generalized wage data, along with more effective remedies,
women will
be better able to recognize and enforce their rights to equal pay for work on jobs that
require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are performed under similar working
conditions.

Sec. 3. Enhanced Enforcement of Equal Pay Act Requirements

Subsection (3)(a)(I): revise by adding, "; except that the United States shall not be liable
for punitive damages." after "appropriate"

Section 4 regarding collection of data will be removed from the bill and a Sense of the
Senate will be added at the end of the bill:

SEC. xxx       SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING INCREASED INFORMATION ON PAY
               DISP ARITIES

It is the Sense of the Senate that the President should take appropriate steps to increase the
amount of information available with respect to wage disparities. In so doing, the President, or
his designees, should consider ways of collecting this data that:

(1) maximize the utility of the information for both the government and the public; while

(2) protecting individuals' privacy and minimizing the burdens on reporting entities.
