TEXT:
Update:   Tomorrow, Erskine will meet with Rep. Lowey and a group of 4
state legislators (OH, IN, MD, MN) who are strongly supporting national
legislation on .08 BAC.  The President will do a drop by to thank them for
their support, and the legislators will have an opportunity to talk to
press after the meeting.  Lowey and Canady will hold a separate press
event with the state legislators on the Hill.

Begala said he would like to hold the .08 BAC report back to the President
for a possible event.   DOT is fine with waiting.
