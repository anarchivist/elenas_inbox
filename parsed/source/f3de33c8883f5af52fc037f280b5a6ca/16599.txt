not sure what I hath wrought.    (Other items are coming.)

Welfare Reform: Council of Economic Advisers' Analysis of Child-Only Cases: In response to a
recent item in CEA's weekly economic briefing on the growth of child-only welfare cases, you
asked whether certain features of the welfare law need to be fixed.

The issue is that one part of the law appears to treat states with growing numbers of child-only
cases unfavorably, while another part of the law is too generous to such states. Since child-only
cases count when measuring a state's caseload reduction credit, a growing child-only caseload
reduces the size of that credit -- and means a state must put more people to work. On the other
hand, a state with more child-only cases can grant more "hardship exceptions" to the 5-year time
limit. This is because these cases are included in the denominator of the 20 hardship exception
calculation despite the fact that none of them need the exception because they are excepted
elsewhere in the law.

We do not believe a fix is needed at this time. On the caseload reduction credit, the tremendous
decline in welfare caseloads is already making the work participation rates far easier to meet than
expected. In addition, letting states calculate the credit by excluding child-only cases might even
give states an incentive to sanction parents and create more child-only cases. Regarding time
limits, we are loath to re-open the issue of time limit exceptions so early in the implementation
process and when there are many groups (battered women, disabled, etc.) that are pressing for
more exceptions, not fewer in this area.
