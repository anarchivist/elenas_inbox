TEXT:
If Dodd wants to stay away, probably the only Dem likely to want to move on it
is Lieberman.  I can't believe Feinstein will be seriously in favor of a bill
preempting her own state, although maybe I'm wrong. How serious is the
PREsident? Does Bruce know? Should we poke around with Lieberman's staff? I
know his LA well.  Ellen
