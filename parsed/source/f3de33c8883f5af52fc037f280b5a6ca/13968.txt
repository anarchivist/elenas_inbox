TEXT:
Liz Hyman from somewhere in doj thinks some amendment p'assed to
the welfare bill that lets states exempt women who are victims of
domestic violence from many of the bill's provisions (like family
cap, etc.)   If so, she points out that we should let women's groups
know to address some of their concerns.    I don't have time to
check this out ....
