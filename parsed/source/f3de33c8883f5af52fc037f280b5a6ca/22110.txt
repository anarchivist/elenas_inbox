      TEXT:
      Please come to a meeting Friday, 2pm, Roosevelt Room to discuss press for
      SOTU and Budget announcements NOT covered by a Presidential event.
      This meeting will be to figure out how we roll-out the smaller policy
      announcements contained in SOTU and Budget through press and surroga~es.

      Let me know if you cannot come.   Thanks.
