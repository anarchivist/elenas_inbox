 Reed; David Kessler; Dr. Koop; Members of Congress; Matt Meyers; AGs; heads of AMA,

         Good morning .. Today I want to talk about one of the most important things we must do
 to keep our country strong and growing into the 21 st century. In recent days, I have laid out an
 ambitious action agenda for the remainder of this legislative session and year. We have pledged
 to work hard to make sure the Congress appropriates the priorities we fought so hard for in our
 balanced budget agreement -- everything from expanding educational opportunity and
 challenging our students, schools and teachers to meet the highest standards to ratifying a
 worldwide climate change treaty to passing campaign finance reform, to assisting in efforts to
 forge lasting peace in places like Northern Ireland and the Middle East. But, we must not
 overlook this simple fact. As we prepare to enter a new century and a new millennium, the
 health of our nation is absolutely dependent on the health of our people -- and especially the
 health of our children.

         That is why last year, I launched the nation's first-ever comprehensive program to protect
 children from the dangers of tobacco. In August oflast year, we initiated an FDA final rule,
 requiring tobacco companies to educate our children about the dangers of smoking and retailers
 to enforce laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to anyone under the age of 18. And we set a
 goal of reducing tobacco use by children and adolescents by 50 percent in seven years. Earlier
 this year, our approach was upheld by a federal judge in North Carolina.

          These victories for the public health, along with the aggressive efforts of the attorneys
  general, drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table and extracted concessions from
  them that would have been unimaginable just a short time ago. Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man
   are no longer around to glamorize smoking. And we are now in the midst of an unprecedented
. national debate involving members of my Administration, the public health community, the
  attorneys general, members of Congress, tobacco farmers and others to develop a comprehensive
  tobacco policy.

         This broad, bipartisan effort has led us from confrontation, denial and inertia to the brink
 of action. Today, I want to challenge the Congress to build on this historic opportunity by
 passing sweeping tobacco legislation that has one goal in mind -- the dramatic reduction of teen
 smoking. In the coming weeks I will invite Congressional leaders from both parties to the
 White House to launch a bipartisan effort to enact federal tobacco legislation. There are five key
 elements that must be at the heart of any national tobacco legislation.

        First, reducing teen smoking has always been this Administration's bottom line. Now it
 must be the industry's bottom line. That is why I believe that tobacco legislation must include a
                                                                                  Hex-DLtifip Conversion

             comprehensive plan to reduce teen smoking, including tough penalties if targets are not met.
             Every day, 3,000 young people start smoking, and 1,000 of them will die early as a result. We
             cannot tum our backs on this tragedy. I believe the right kind of tobacco legislation must
             include stiff penalties that are non-deductible, uncapped and escalating to give the tobacco
             industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting kids. One of the surest ways of
             reducing youth smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. By some estimates, a 10%
             increase in cigarette prices will lead to a 7% drop in youth smoking.

                     Today, I am calling for a combination of industry payments and penalties that could
             increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next decade if the youth reduction
             targets are not met. And I call on the House to follow the lead of the Senate and repeal the
             provision giving the tobacco industry a $50 billion credit.

                    Second, any legislation must affirm the full authority of the FDA to regulate tobacco
             products. I believe that the FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as great and
             unencumbered as its authority over other drugs and devices.

                    Third, effective legislation must include measures to hold the industry accountable for
             past misconduct, especially efforts to market products to children, while insisting that it change
             the way it does business. That means greater document disclosure and, most importantly, no
             marketing or advertising directed to children.

                     Fourth, federal tobacco legislation must provide enough funds and resources to not only
             reduce youth smoking, but to meet other public health goals, such as the reduction of
             environmental, or second-hand tobacco smoke, the expansion of smoking cessation programs,
             the strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco and the provision of funds for
             medical research and other health objectives. These additional resources will build on the
             15-cents-a-pack cigarette tax included in our balanced budget agreement to help states provide
             health care for up to 5 million uninsured children and help prevent many young people from
             taking up smoking in the first place.

                     And finally, any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities.
             We know that most tobacco farmers live and work on small, family farms. In some states, entire
             communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. Any legislation must ensure the protection
             of these tobacco farmers, their families and their communities.

                     Let me be clear: this is not about money or how much we can extract from the tobacco
             industry. It is about protecting the health of America's most precious resource -- our children.
             Again, I want to thank Secretary Shalala, Secretary Glickman, and Bruce Reed of my
             Administration and all those who have worked so hard to bring us to this point. You have
             created an historic opportunity for progress in our efforts to reduce teen smoking.

                    Thank you.
