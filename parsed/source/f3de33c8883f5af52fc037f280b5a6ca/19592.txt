                                       REMARKS FOR SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT
                                                 THE WHITE HOUSE
                                                    APRIL 27,1998

                           Anyone who has ever been a parent knows the absolute joy -- and the awesome
                   responsibility -- that comes with raising a child. We will do everything we can to keep our
                   children safe from harm -- from strapping on their seat belts in the car, to bundling them up
                   against the winter cold, to teaching them to say no to drugs.

                          We accept that we cannot always predict all the challenges that may come our children's
                   way. But the dangers and consequences of tobacco are plain to all. The temptation to try
                   tobacco is one of the greatest threats our children face.

                           That is why today's disturbing news -- that more and more minority teens are falling to
                   the temptation of cigarettes -- must galvanize our efforts to protect all our children from tobacco.
                    We all know that today's statistics are part of a larger trend: Every day, 3,000 young people
                   light up their first cigarettes and become smokers for life. One thousand of them will die as a
                   result.

                           The cold hard facts are adding up. The call to action is getting louder. And time is
                   running out. Congress has just four weeks to pass a comprehensive bipartisan tobacco bill that
                   can help save the lives of millions of our children -- that will cut teen smoking by raising the
                   price of cigarettes, imposing strong penalties on tobacco companies who continue advertising to
                   children, and giving the FDA full authority to regulate children's access to tobacco products.

                            Senator McCain's bill is a strong step in this direction. Make no mistake about it: The
                   legislation explicitly changes the rules of the game so that the tobacco industry can no longer do
                   what it has done for years -- profit at the expense of our children's health.

                            It is time to end the delay. It seems as if we're in a situation where we know what the
                   illness is -- too many children lured to smoking by unscrupulous, multi-million dollar advertising
                   campaigns that have targeted our youth for decades. We know that the cure is -- tough,
                   comprehensive bipartisan legislation to end these practices and cut teen smoking. And yet we're
                   hesitating. No parent who knows how to cure a sick child would stand by and do nothing. For
                   our children's sake, we must not walk away from this session of Congress without a
                   comprehensive tobacco bill.

                            I don't want to tum this tobacco settlement into a political issue for the fall. I want an
                   achievement for this spring -- a bipartisan tobacco law that will open a new chapter in
                   America's efforts to protect the health of our children. Let us all work together to build a
                   brighter future for our children.
