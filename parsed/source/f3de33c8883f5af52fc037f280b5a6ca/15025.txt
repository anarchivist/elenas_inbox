TEXT:
Here's the    list we just discussed   for Monday meetings -- I've added Jerry
Mande (who    I ironically left off;   he's worked very closely with Bruce Reed
on tobacco    strategy over the past   two years) and Mellisa Scofield.  I
suggest we    give the list to Thurm   as our suggested list.

HHS -- Kevin Thurm, Harriet Rabb, General Counsel; Bill Corr, COS; Mellisa
Scofield, press secretary; Andy Hyman, coordinates everything, ;
FDA--Jim O'Hara, press secretary; Bill Schultz, deputy for policy; Jerry
Mande, senior advisor to the Commissioner;
DoJ-- David Ogden; George Philips
WH -- Bruce Reed, Bruce Lindsey, Ron Klain, Rahm.
