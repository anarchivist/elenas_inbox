TEXT:
Ford and Robb say they are basically happy with the outcome in finance
today.  There is still a lot of concern about Lugar gaining support, and
some confusion about the health groups' position. We have worked at
making sure the .health groups' position is clear.

Senator Ford is most worried about Durbin, Mosley-Braun, Feingold, Boxer,
Lautenberg, Torrecelli, and Leahy being tempted to vote for Lugar.  Ford
is likely to have many, many amendments in the offing in case Lugar wins,
in which case Ford's goal would be to go after the whole bill.
