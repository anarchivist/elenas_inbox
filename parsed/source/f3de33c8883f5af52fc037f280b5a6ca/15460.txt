She says she wants them in     hand in case the decision is made to have the
meeting;
she also said believe it or    not that she wanted one re: what to say if a
decision hasn't been made.     I think these should suffice.===;;=;;;;;;;;;;;;;; ATTACH

                      Q&As on Welfare Meeting with Texas Delegation
                                        517197



If no decision has been made regarding a meeting between Chief of Staff and Texas delegation:

Question:     Did you get a letter from Senators Gramm and Hutchison and Representatives
              Armey, Delay, Archer, Stenholm, Hall, and Johnson asking for a meeting next
              week with the President's Chief of Staff? Do you plan to agree to the request?

Answer:       We have received the letter, but no meeting has been scheduled yet.


If the Chief of Staff has agreed to meet with the members of the Texas delegation:

Question:     Did you get a letter from Senators Gramm and Hutchison and Representatives
              Armey, Delay, Archer, Stenholm, Hall, and Johnson asking for a meeting next
              week with the President's Chief of Staff? Do you plan to agree to the request?

Answer:       We did get the letter. We do plan to meet with these members of Congress to
              discuss the response we have given to the state of Texas. We do not intend to
              re-open the issue of the Texas request at this meeting, but instead to discuss with
              members of Congress the position we will have already discussed with state
              officials.

              Last week, HHS and USDA officials met with the Texas Health and Human
              Services Commissioner. They told him that the state could release an RFO
              subject to written guidelines that will be provided by the agencies. By the
              time the Chief of Staff meets with members of Congress, the agencies will
              have conveyed these guidelines, which will make clear what federal statutes
              and regulations allow - and what they prohibit - with respect to
              privatization.

                  [In general, Texas will not be allowed to privatize eligibility
                  determination or information gathering functions.          The state,
                  however, will be able to contract with a private party to do outreach
                  and to revamp computer and other automation systems.]

                  We have never stated publicly the bracketed information, but this was
                  the line taken by the agencies in this meeting with Commissioner
                  McKinney. This distinction does not apply toTemporary Assistance
                  to Needy Families, i.e., cash welfare, which the new welfare law
                  explicitly allows to be privatized.
