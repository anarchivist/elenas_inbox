TEXT:
She said, not entirely tongue-in-cheek, that she'd have more time for a
recruitment effort leading up the the 17th if she wasn't worrying about
how disappointed her board members will be when they can't see the
President on the 19th.

She said they have 2,500 companies to date and they have not announced
that number yet and that it could be done in Wichita.  November 17th will
be six months from May 20th, when they pledged to have 1,000 companies
within 6 months -- so it will be a good announcement.   Also on my list
are:

       New caseload numbers (down for 40 months in a row);
       Welfare to Work grant application --$ available for more
communities
               to do innovative projects like these
       Hammer award (usually awarded by VP, but POTUS or Cuomo could do
it)
