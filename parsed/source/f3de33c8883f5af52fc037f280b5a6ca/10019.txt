TEXT:
Per Elena, here is a proposed paragraph to add to tomorrow's speech at the
bill signing.  The AG's office is fine w/it, but Treasury wanted until
tomorrow a.m. to review.  Elena was planning to raise this at the senior
staff meeting tomorrow.

"The City of Chicago has just filed suit alleging that an undercover
investigation it conducted revealed widespread practices by gun dealers of
selling guns illegally, counseling purchasers on how to evade firearms
regulations, and selling guns to those who have said that they intend to
violate the law.  If proven, these serious charges would demonstrate that
many in the gun industry are helping to promote an illegal market in
firearms.  Such conduct endangers public safety, and we will be watching
the progress of this lawsuit closely."
