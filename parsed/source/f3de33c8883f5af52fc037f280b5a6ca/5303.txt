TEXT:
EK/Michael:

I spoke to Lynn Cutler and Mickey's assistant, who paged Mickey for me.
Everybody is clear that the report is not to go out if it has budget
#s/options in it. Mickey was speaking at the conference today, and Lynn
is flying down tonight. The Interior folks aren't scheduled to speak
until tomorrow afternoon, and that's when they were going to distribute
the report.  Lynn said that, if she or Mickey doesn't speak to InterIor
before, she will get to them personally when she flies in tonight -- or at
the morning breakfast that they're all scheduled to attend w/Babbit.

Jose'
