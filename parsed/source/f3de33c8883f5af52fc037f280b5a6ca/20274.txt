TEXT:
One of the follow-up actions discussed after the meeting this morning was
to have OMB lead a process of working with the agencies to get more/better
information on program and budget implications of alternative measures.
This will probably take several months.  One of the other things we could
do in the meantime is start talking to the various interest groups about
their views on the NAS recommendation (this would open discussion on the
general issue of revising the poverty measure without revealing where we
mayor may not be headed).   I think NEC, OMB, CEA and us will work
together first thing next week on other process issues, so any other
thoughts from either of you would be welcome!
