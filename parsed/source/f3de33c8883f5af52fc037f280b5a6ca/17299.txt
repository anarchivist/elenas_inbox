TEXT:
I'd suggest the following topics for today:


I.   Task Forces
 Announce we'll have meetings on specific problems to keep formulating
positions on:

Farmers,    ( Rawls may have some update on what he hears)

International,    (NEC had fractious meeting)

Legal

Court case-- what we've heard about where case is, need to push DOJ/HHS to
be ready in short-term, just in case.

(a message, a legislative group?)


II.     Update Events

VPOTUS trip to Florida, next trip to Chicago

What you've heard legislatively

(Synar?)
