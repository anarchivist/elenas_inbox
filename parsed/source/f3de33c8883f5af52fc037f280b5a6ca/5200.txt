TEXT:
February -- Tony Blair visit may be 5th and 6th, but still pending.  It
does look likely that it will be a two· day visit. Do you want to submit a
written proposal for a welfare event with,Blair? Everyone seems clear
that POTUS is interested in doing a domestic event with him, so we don't
need to rush to do it.

We have submitted the request for Dec. 1 World AIDS Day event.  Folks were
clearly opposed to it b/c POTUS is doing a town hall two days later, so I
have let scheduling know we can change the format to either a roundtable
or just have him satellite into an existing event and make remarks.  Other
ideas?

Also, just so you know, DOJ is now saying the crime victimization #s may
not be out until the 16th (Sunday) in which case we can't do and
event/oral statement. We should know later tonight.

 Also, McCaffrey's office has submitted a request to invite reps from 70
 civic organizations who have agreed to sign an alliance to fight youth
 drug use to the WH for an event with the President. They are planning to
 be in DC on the 18th, but it looks like the only open message day all
.month is the 13th -- so now ONDCP is trying to get this event for that
 day.  The groups represent 55 million people -- it's groups like the Elks,
 etc.  -- and it would be a fine event if nothing else is going on.  I
 don't think Rahm is crazy about it, although it's hard to tell, and Ann
 Lewis and Sylvia seem close to putting on the schedule. What do you
 think? Should we propose something else for the 13th or just wait to see
 what fate has in store.
