MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:       JOHN HILLEY & GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:    COMP TIME/ FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT LEGISLATION

I.   BACKGROUND/ANALYSIS

     This memorandum offers options for how to achieve the optimal outcome from the
     current legislative debate on comp time and expansion of the Family and Medical Leave
     Act (FMLA).

     This week and next week, the House and Senate labor committees are holding hearings
     regarding comp time legislation: the Ballenger bill in the House and the Ashcroft bill in
     the Senate. Both bills address only comp time and not FMLA expansion, and they
     provide fewer guarantees of employee choice and fewer protections against potential
     abuse than your bill, which was sent to Congress last September. For example, the
     Republican bills:

     1) Do not exclude vulnerable workers;
     2) Do not include special protections for workers whose employers go bankrupt or shut
        down unexpectedly;
     3) Do not guarantee real choice for employees because they allow employers to refuse
        employees' use of comp time if it would ''unduly disrupt" operations. (Your bill, on
        the other hand, allowed employees to take comp time for FMLA purposes at any time,
        and to take it for other purposes with two weeks notice unless it would cause the
        employer "substantial and grievous injury.");
     4) Allow employers 'to cash out employees' comp time over 80 hours, thereby denying
        them the use of comp time;
     5) Provide weaker remedies for violations. Your bill has solutions to a.ll of these
        problems.

     In addition, the Ashcroft bill has additional provisions that would effectively eliminate
     the 40 hour week by allowing employers to establish 80 hour biweekly schedules and, in
     certain circumstances, to pay employees straight time, not time and a half, for hours
     worked over 40 in a week or 80 in two weeks. Sen. Jeffords plans to mark up the
     Ashcroft bill on February 26, and Rep. Ballenger plans to mark up his bill in early March.

     Senator Dodd, Sen. Murray, Rep. Clay, and Rep. Maloney have instead introduced bills
     to expand the FMLA. The bills introduced by Maloney and Murray would expand
     FMLA for an additional twenty-four hours for the purposes of routine medical care for
     children and elderly parents or school related activities, similar to your bill. The bills
     introduced by Dodd and Clay would lower the threshold of FMLA applicability from 50
                         Hex-Dump Conversion
       employees to 25 employees, which would cover an additional 10 million employees in
       small businesses.
       The FMLA bills have support from women's groups and the labor movement, both of
       which are more enthusiastic about dropping the threshold than providing an additional 24
       hours ofleave. The labor movement strongly oPP?ses the Republican comp time bills,
       and finds the provisions in the Ashcroft bill that eliminate the 40-hour work week to be
       particularly offensive. Most Republicans oppose any expansion ofFMLA.

       The current legislative strategy among congressional Democratic leaders is to criticize the
       comp time bills and try to add the various FMLA expansions to the Republican bills.
       Your bill has not been introduced, nor is there any Democratic version of a comp time
       bill. The labor movement has requested that the Administration threaten to veto any bill
       that doesn't (1) improve the comp time provisions to provide real choice and real
       protections for employees, and (2) link FMLA and comp time.

II.    ACTION-FORCING EVENT

       The Vice President will be addressing the AFL-CIO at an annual meeting on February 18
       and will be forced to address these issues either in remarks or in questions and answers.
       Thus, a decision must be made now regarding whether to adopt a strategy of insisting on
       linkage between FMLA and comp time, and whether to issue any veto threats. The
       options are laid out below. In each case, the Vice President would articulate the
       Administration position on February 18 at the AFL-CIO meeting.

III.   OPTIONS

1.     Threaten to veto the bill if your principles are not addressed. The Administration
       would layout a set of principles needed for a bill to be truly family friendly. We would
       say that the bill should include FMLA expansion, and that any bill that doesn't meet
       certain principles will be vetoed, but we would not link a veto to FMLA expansion.
       These principles are embodied in your bill from last year:

       A)            Real Choice for Employees, including the right to take comp time when
                     needed for FMLA purposes, the right to choose to use comp time for any
                     purpose with two weeks notice to their employer unless use of comp time
                     will cause substantial and grievous injury to the employer, the right to cash
                     out comp time for overtime pay on 15 days notice and employers can't
                     choose to cash out comp time; and

       B)            Real Protection Against Employer Abuse, including the various
                     protective provisions in your bill that are not present in the Republican
                     bills, such as exclusions for vulnerable workers, special protections in case
                     employers go bankrupt or close down unexpectedly, a prohibition against
                     employers' substituting comp time for paid vacation or sick leave benefits,
                     a prohibition against employers penalizing employees who choose
                          Hex-Dump Conversion


                      overtime pay instead of comp time, and strong provisions for enforcement.

       C)             Preservation of Basic Worker Rights. The Administration would
                      threaten a veto of any bill that eliminates the 40 hour work week, as the
                      Ashcroft bill does.

Pros: A. Would strengthen the position of congressional Democrats arguing to improve the
      Republican bills. Would encourage congressional Republicans to negotiate in an effort
      to produce a bill that would become law.

       B. If the strategy resulted in changes to the bills, it would significantly improve upon
       bills that presently do not carry guarantees of employee ~hoice or adequate protection
       against employer abuse.

       C. Would be welcomed by constituency groups that view the Republican bills as a
       weakening of employee protection laws, and would strengthen the leadership position of
       Democrats on women's issues.

       D. Since this strategy doesn't threaten a veto if the FMLA expansion is not in a final
       bill, it has the effect of assisting the Democrats who are trying to add FMLA expansion to
       the bills without locking you in to a veto on that specific issue.

Con: You might have to veto a comp time bill, although it would be one that 'would fall far
     short of the family friendly principles you have laid out.

2.     Threaten to veto a bill if your principles are not addressed AND FMLA expansion is
       not included. This strategy is the same as #1 above except that a fourth veto principle
       would be the expansion of FMLA. The rationale is that FMLA and comp time are linked
       family friendly policies. Since comp time is not mandatory, the only guarantee that
       covered workers will have any additional leave is through FMLA expansion amendments.
        FMLA is one of your signature programs and this is one way to ensure its passage in a
       Republican Congress.

Pros: Same as A, B & C above. In addition, the AFL-CIO has requested this particular
      strategy and veto threat. Sen. Kennedy also prefers this strategy and veto threat.

Cons: A. Sen. Daschle is skeptical that his colleagues will support a strategy that insists on
      FMLA expansion as the price for any comp time bill, however strong. It is difficult to
      defend the logic of refusing to accept one positive change in the law merely because a
      second positive change has not also been made.

       B. If the strategy fails to produce a bill that includes FMLA expansion, you might have
       to veto a very strong comp time bill just because it doesn't include FMLA expansion.

3.     Introduce principles for a family-friendly bill. We would layout the principles listed
                          Hex-Dump Conversion


      in #1 above and would insist that they are all vital to a family friendly bill, but would not
      explicitly threaten a veto.
Pros: A. Would layout principles for a bill without locking you in to a veto.

       B. Would leave open the option of vetoing a weak comp time bill or a bill that fails to
       expand FMLA.

Cons: Not likely to produce changes to the Republican bills, thus could make it more likely that
      you face signing a bill that doesn't include sufficient employee choice and protections.
      Signing such a bill would have the dual results of significantly altering the Fair Labor
      Standards Act without sufficient safeguards and also seriously angering the labor
      movement and disappointing women's groups.

IV.    DECISION:
