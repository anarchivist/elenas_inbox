TEXT:
We came up with a decent compromise on Shaw's proposal to ban 3-time
felons from SSI: The penalties of 10 years ineligibility and a lifetime
ban would apply only to felonies committed while the person is on SSI.
This comports with Shaw's logic that if you can commit a crime, you should
be able to work.  It would be fair to the person who committed 3 felonies
early in life and then rehabilitated himself, and it doesn't set a new
precedent of banning people from benefit programs simply because they're
felons.

I agree with Shaw on the first 2.   Maybe you could narrow the 3rd one to
violent felonies.
