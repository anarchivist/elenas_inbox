TEXT:
Rahm, et. al . :

Treasury public affairs says that Pierre Thomas has told them he's doing a
CNN piece on the recently approved permits for 600,000 (after our review
started).  I'm not sure of the timing or our immiment directive (Staff
Secretary said the President still hadn't sent back the 2nd memo on this),
but clearly -- if we go w/option #3 -- this story is pretty much moot.   My
understanding is that Pierre's not doing anything tonight, but that this
could come up as soon as tomorrow night.

Jose'
