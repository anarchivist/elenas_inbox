                               THE WHITE HOUSE

                        Office of the Press Secretary

For Immediate Release                                     June.17, 1998



                          REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
                      AND CHIEF OF STAFF ERSKINE BOWLES



                             The Briefing Room



6:15 P.M. EDT


             THE PRES~DENT: Good afternoon.    The vote that was just
completed in the Senate clearly shows that a bipartisan majority of
57 clearly supports tough legislation to protect the children of this
country from tobacco. Needless to say, I am very disappointed that a
Republican minority blocked the legislation from being voted on.

             Today, like every other day, 3,000 young children start
to smoke, and 1,000 of them will have their lives shortened because
of it. If more members of the Senate would vote like parents rather
than politicians we could solve this problem and go on to other
business of the country.


             I have been working for three years now to protect our
children from the dangers of tobacco.  I want the tobacco lobby and
its allies on Capitol Hill to know that from my point of view this
battle·is far from over.

              Q       Sir, what's your strategy, what do you do now?

             THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Senate has to come back to it,
but they have to do it in a hurry if we're going to act. After all,
we only have six weeks until the August recess -- not quite that --
and then we have only a month or so when they come back, the month of
September, because they will, doubtless, want to go home in October
to campaign.

             So the parameters of this bill are well-known; what has
to be done to get a bill that can not only pass, but can actually be
effective not only in raising the price of cigarettes, but in
limiting advertising and having smoking cessation programs and giving
the public health money out there, the research money we need.
Everybody knows what has to be done.

             We showed a lot of flexibility here in trying to work
with the members of the Senate. We had a tax cut in there to deal
with the marriage penalty for people with incomes under $50,000. We
had some more anti-drug money in there.  The lawyer fee issue was
addressed in the amendment most recently adopted. We can do this,
and we need to do it and do it promptly.

             There is not a lot of time, but I think it would be a
great mistake for those who believe that because of the $40 million
ad campaign by the tobacco industry which has gone unanswered and
which has a lot of things in it which are just false, that they now
have a free ride on this to walk away from 1,000 lives a day. We
don't have a free ride to walk away from 1,000 lives a day. And I
believe we can do it.

              Q       Is it really dead?   Isn't it really dead, Mr.
President?
D,


              THE PRESIDENT:     No, I don't think it is dead.

             Q      You were depending on it for a lot of tax revenue,
Mr. President.    If you don't get it, where do you find that revenue?

             THE PRESIDENT: That's not entirely true.   It is true
that a lot of the things that I think should be funded in terms of
giving this money back to the states, who are out a lot of money
because they spent a fortune treating people on tobacco-related'
illnesses, could be used to help children and families with things
like child care. The Senate voted for that, and I thought it was a
good amendment.

             But the most important thing here is not that.  The most
important thing is to protect children from the dangers of tobacco.
And that is at the nub of this and that is what needs to be put front
and center. And if they will do it, we can still do this.   But they
have to hurry.  There's not a lot of time.


              Q       Mr. President --

              THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Bowles is handling all the details
 of this, and I think I should let him come up and talk about it.

              Q    Mr. President, do you think there will be political
 consequences for the people if this bill fails?

              THE PRESIDENT:  I certainly hope there will be, and
 there should be.  I think that there are those who believe there
 won't be because the public has been treated to $40 million of
 unanswered'advertising by their allies. And they believe that the
 opinion that may be held in certain selected districts or whatever
 today is the one that will hold at election day.  I don't believe
 that's true.  I think when the American people understand fully what
 has been going on, they won't like what they see and they will be
 worried about these children. They nearly always -- the public
 almost always gets it right when they have enough time, and they've
 got plenty of time.

              So I think we need to do this.

              Q       Mr. President, was it necessary to increase --

             Q       stay in session, and will you forego your own
vacation in order to get this done? Would you forego your vacation?

             MR. BOWLES:   Sam, I'd be delighted to forego my
vacation. As a matter of fact, seriously, I talked to Senator Lott
today, and I told Senator Lott that we would be here in the month of
August, that we would be here in the month of October, and we were
prepared to move forward with this bill and continue to fight at
every step of the process.

              Q       Is he the villain of the piece?

              MR. BOWLES:     I think there are 42 villains.

             Q    You're right, it was a serious question, and you
answered it seriously. But the President could calIon the Senate to
stay in session until it took this bill up again and passed some
version of the bill that could be sent to the House.

             MR. BOWLES: We're going to continue both in the House
and in the Senate to fight for passage of this bill. You're going to
see this bill attached to almost every piece of legislation that
comes down the pike. You're going to see us try to get the
Hansen-Meehan bill discharged in the House 'of Representatives.  We're
going
to continue to move forward with this bill because it's what the
American people want, and 57 senators voted for it today.

             Q        What do you think really then stopped it cold in
its tracks now?

            MR. BOWLES:   I think this is what I believe is the
woist of Washington. I t~ink politics stopped this thing cold.

             Q    Well, what do you say, Mr. Bowles, to those who say
there was a $350 billion deal that the state attorneys general made,


     and that in the. process of getting legislation you added on another
     $150 billion which made it simply intolerable to the tobacco
     industry?

                  MR. BOWLES:  I think that's incorrect.  I think what we
     did was make this bill have a higher probability of doing something
     about stopping teenage smoking. Every study I've seen has shown that
     you need at least $1.10 increase in the price of tobacco in order to
     do something serious about stopping kids from smoking.  So this bill
     that we had had full FDA authority in there; it had $1.10 increase in
     the price of tobacco; it had the right kinds of things in there to
     stop marketing to kids; and it had the right things in there to
     lessen the chance that kids would have access to tobacco.  So it had
     the kinds of things that we felt were important.

                  In addition, it had what the Republicans said they
(    needed.  It had the anti-drug provisions; it had a tax cut. There's
     only one reason that this thing didn't pass, and that's that $40
     million that the tobacco industry spent on it and the $12 million
     worth of campaign contributions that they had made.

                  Q    Instead of getting a bill that the tobacco industry
     would have supported, that would have generated $350 billion in
     revenue, that would have done all the things on advertising, you wind
     up with nothing.

                  MR. BOWLES: Oh, I don't think it's any ~hance that
     we're going to wind up with nothing.  I think they have made a clear
     mistake.  I think the American people will demand this happen.  I
     have not met a single parent that wants their kids to begin to smoke.

                   Q      So you think November is going to show the results
     of this?

                   MR. BOWLES:    I certainly hope so.

                   Q      How does this affect the balanced budget?

                   Q    The President said the ad campaign has gone
     unanswered.   Why has it gone unanswered? Why haven't you responded?

                  MR. BOWLES:  The industry has spent $40 million
     advertising. We have tried to do the best we could with the limited
     resources we had to come forward and get the message across to the
     American people. We have used the bully pulpit. The public health
     community has come forward with some ads, as you know, in order to
     educate people about this. We simply could not compete with that $40
     million that the industry chose to spend.

                  Q    So your basic strategy now is to attach it to every
     bill that goes forward?

                  MR. BOWLES: We're going to try to attach it to every
     major piece of legislation that comes forward. We're going to make
     this a fight to the finish.

                  Q    Mr. Bowles, does the tobacco industry have reason
     to celebrate tonight? Has its investment paid off?

                   MR. BOWLES:    I think the American people have a reason


 to really be sad tonight.  I really do.     I think every parent in this
 room should really be upset.

             Q     Did you and the President work the phones today,
 lobbying members of the Senate to try to --

              MR. BOWLES: Yes, we did. And I think that's how we got
 14 -- it's one of the reasons we got 14 Republicans to vote yes.

              Q    Approximately, how many senators did you talk to
 and the President talked to?

              MR. BOWLES:  I talked to a lot; ,I think the President
 said he talked to 10.  I can't remember the exact number I talked to.

              Q    -- Republican Caucus today that led to this
 strategy of the defeat of the bill?

                MR. BOWLES:   I certainly think so.

                Q     Mr. Bowles, how will this affect the balanced
 budget?

              MR. BOWLES:  I don't think it's going to have a material
 effect on the balanced budget, Wolf.  I think if you look at the
 budget we put together, the revenues that are going to come in here
 were going to be spent for research, they were going to be spent for
 counter-advertising and smoking cessation programs and public health.
 They were going to be spent for tobacco farmers and also going to be
 spent -- money going back to the states. And that's money now that
 we will not have, and therefore, we will not spend it.

                Q     Weren't you also going to spend money on child
 care?

             MR. BOWLES: The child care money was in the money going
to the states. There was about $25 billion going to the states; some
of that was child care money.  There was about -- Bruce, correct me
if my numbers are wrong -- about $13 billion going for research,
about $13 billion going for smoking cessation counter-advertising and
public health, and about $10 billion going to the tobacco farmers.
And I think that's roughly the whole amount of money.

             Q    Are you willing to come down on the overall number
a little bit to try to meet 'the tobacco industry halfway?

             MR. BOWLES: We have spent so long on this bill. We got
it through·the Senate committee on a vote by 19-1; we got 57
senators, well over a majority of the senators to vote for this
thing. This is the right bill. This is the right construction, And
we're going to go forward with this bill and try to get it passed.

             Q    Is this an indication, sir, that the President may
have lost some clout with Congress because of his legal and personal
problems?

                MR. BOWLES:   I don't see how.   He got 57 senators to
vote for him.

                Thank you.



                THE PRESS:   Thank you.

                END                       6:28 P.M. EDT
