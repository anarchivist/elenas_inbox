TEXT:
I have learned a bit more about the Jackson event on Wall Street on the
15th. The focus is on empowering minority communities through expanded
entrepeneurship and economic growth.  It sounds like, if we wanted to make
a policy announcement, it would be on the Community Empowerment Fund. Do
you want this to happen? Should I talk to Paul/Jose' about it? Thanks.
