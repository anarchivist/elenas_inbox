I understand the FY 2000 budget may contain a $13 million USDA school
breakfast pilot program. Mrs. Gore may do a USDA education related event
in New Hampshire in a couple of weeks (highlighting, among other things,
the Child Nutrition Re-authorization act the President signed authorizing
afterschool snack program funds).  We would like to consider having Mrs.
Gore announce this budget proposal during the event.  From your
perspective, is this ok? Thank you.
