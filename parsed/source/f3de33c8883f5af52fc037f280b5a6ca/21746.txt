TEXT:
The President sent John and Maria a copy of an ad re Phthalates. He asked
that it be checked out. We have attached a couple of articles and we
also understand the Toy R Us has pulled toys with Phthalates off the
shelves.

I will send you a copy of the ad and articles.

Since it has trade implications Maria would like someone in NEC and DPC to
check it out and get back to us.

Thanks
