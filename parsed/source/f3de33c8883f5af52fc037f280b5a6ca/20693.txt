Erskine is scheduled to meet with Alexis Herman and Tony Coehlo next
Thursday (7/23) to discuss the work of the Presidential Task Force on
Employment of Adults w/ Disabilities.

(Would you mind prepraring a short briefing paper and appropriate talking
points for the meeting? I'd also like any suggestions as to who from the
White House should be part of the meeting.)

As I mentioned in my e-mail a few weeks ago, the initial request from the
Secretary's office included an agenda that focused on getting a commitment
from Erskine that the White House will try to have the President attend
the Task Force's July meeting and make an announcement endorsing the
principles underlying Kennedy-Jeffords.  It also sounds like they want a
commitment from the President that he will work with the two Senators to
produce a mutually agreeable bill the President could sign.

I imagine we will try to do a short briefing some time before the meeting.
