TEXT:
Here is the Goodling stuff for the weekly. It is longer than we wanted,
but its complete.  I don't know how much you care about space limitations;
edit if you need to, and call if you need help editing.

I also discovered as I was attaching this that I have two files with
almost the same name.   If this is the wrong Goodling file, I'll send the
right one right away.

     National Testing Initiative: Goodling Amendment. Rep. Goodling offered an amendment to
     the supplemental appropriations bill that would have prohibited the Education Department from
     spending any funds on the development of national tests. If enacted, this provision would have
     stopped our work in its tracks. The amendment, which was not included in the package
     approved by the Rules Committee, was objected to on procedural grounds by Rep. Obey, and
     immediately dropped.

     Rep. Goodling has raised both policy and procedural concerns about the testing initiative, and it
     is not yet clear which are in fact most important to him. On policy grounds, he has argued that
     the tests will lead to ranking of schools, showing only that schools with disadvantaged students
     perform worse than those with more advantaged students. He has also argued that the tests will
     do little to improve curriculum better prepare teachers or get parents more involved. On
     procedural grounds, he has argued that a policy of national testing is simply too big, and too
     controversial and step to take without the involvement of the Congress. This was the primary
     argument he advanced in a "Dear Colleague" letter in support of his amendment.

     Secretary Riley called Mr. Goodling to discuss his concerns and to ask him not to offer his
     amendment. He received a noncommital response. Rep. Riggs, who has supported our testing
     initiative, attempted to broker a compromise, in the form of a commitment from the
     Administration that we would not proceed to implement the tests without specific Congressional
     authorization. We chose not to accept that offer, because we do not believe such statutory
     authority is required, and because we believe that it would have been strategically wrong to make
     that concession at this time.

     However, we anticipate that we will in fact engage Congress shortly in this issue, as we prepare
     legislation to reauthorize the NAEP. While the issue is still under discussion, we are likely to
     propose that the National Assessment Governing Board assume responsibility for the individual
     tests, much as they are responsible for governing NAEP at present.

     There was slightly more than a week from when we first leamed that Mr. Goodling was
     considering such an amendment, to its eventual introduction. Especially because this was not
     germane to the underlying legislation, it garnered relatively littel attention, and there has been no
     good way to accurately guage our strength if this amendment were put to a vote. However,
     some things became sufficiently clear, and these lessons will guide our future actions.

     Fortunately, we have strong support among Democrats on the House education committee. Rep.
     Miller and Rep. Roemer, among others, were prepared to lead a floor battle if necessary. In
     additon, the business community remains a strong ally. On very short notice, the National
     Alliance of Business, working with the Business Roundtable, the National Association of
     Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce, began to provide documentation of business
     support and began to contact Members indicating their support.

     We believe that support for these tests in parts of the education community is soft in spots, much
     as was initially the case with Goals 2000. The AFT and the Council of Chief State School
     Officers are strong supporters, as are the leaders of the NEA and National School Boards

identity large cities that will participate in the testing program. However, organizations
representing local school administrators, the PTA's, and others, could conceivably have lined up
behind Mr. Goodling. As a result, the Education Department, together with DPC, is starting a
new series of briefings for the leaders of the K-12 education groups that will both clarity the
details of the initiative and underscore the importance of this initiative to the Secretary and to
you.

There continues to be concern about the tests among civil rights groups. The particular focus of
concern is on how students with limited English proficiency will perform on the 4th grade
reading test. This test will be give only in English, because it is a test of proficiency in reading
in English. (In contrast, the Education Department will fund the development of a
Spanish-language version of the 8th grade math test). Civil rights groups feel this will
disadvantage recent immigrants, who ought to be given the test in their native language. This
will not be an easy issue to resolve. Education Department staff will meet with the civil rights
groups next week, and will also work to identity possible options for responding to the concerns.
 None of the options are well developed yet.

One way of strengthening support among both education and civil rights groups is to strengthen
our message that this initiative is as much about preparing students as it is about testing students.
 Togetherwith the Education Department, we are working on several steps that will address this.
 These include stepping up efforts to identity and disseminate information and useful materials
about effective practices for improving reading and math performance (some of which is
underway as part of America Reads), and working with OSTP and NSF to design and launch a
coordinated strategy for using federal and nonfederal resources available to improve math
performance. In addition, our efforts to recruit cities for the testing program is explicitly
designed to both encourage and assist cities in implementing locally designed efforts to better
prepare students for the tests.
