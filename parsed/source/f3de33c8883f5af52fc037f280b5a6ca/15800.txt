                                 A BILL                   Hex·Dump Conversion




  To prohibit any attempt to create a human being using

           somatic cell nuclear transfer, to provide for further

           review of the ethical and scientific issues associated

           with the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer in human

           beings, and for other purposes.



     Be it enacted by the Senate and House-of Representatives

of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1.     SHORT TITLE.-This Act may be cited as the "Cloning

Prohibition Act of 1997".

SECTION 2.     FINDINGS.

     (a) It has been reported that an adult sheep has been cloned

using a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer, a form

of cloning.

     (b) The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) has

reviewed     the   scientific   and   ethical   implications         of    this

technology's potential use to clone human beings.

             (1) NBAC has found that:

                   (a) Somatic cell nuclear transfer technology may

            have many applications for biotechnology, livestock

            production, and new medical approaches including the

            production of pharmaceutical proteins and prospects
                                                      HexcDump Conversion
      for regeneration and repair of human tissues.

             (b) However, the possibility of using somatic

      cell nuclear transfer for the purposes of creating

      a child entails significant scientific uncertainty

      and   medical     risk.      Potential     risks,       known      and

      unknown, could result in harm to a child.

      (2) The NBAC concluded unanimously that at this time

it is morally unacceptable for anyone in the public or

private sector, whether in a research or clinical setting,

to attempt to create a child using somatic cell nuclear

transfer cloning.        The Commission's consensus is based

on current scientific information indicating that this

technique is not safe to use in humans at this point.

      (3) Moreover, in addition to issues of safety, the

Commission identified many additional serious ethical

concerns which they agreed require a                great deal more

widespread and careful public deliberation before this

technology may be used.

      (4) NBAC recommended a continuation of the current

moratorium on the use of Federal funds to support any

attempt to create a child by somatic cell nuclear transfer,

and   an    immediate    request   to   all    firms,      clinicians,

investigators,     and    professional    societies          to     comply

voluntarily with the intent of the Federal moratorium.

      (5) NBAC further recommended that Federal legislation
                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion
be enacted to prohibit anyone from attempting, whether

in a research or clinical setting, to create a child through

somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning.

        (6)   NBAC also recommended that the united States

cooperate      with    other   countries   to       enforce       mutually

supported restrictions on this activity.

        (7)   NBAC    specified   that   the     legislation          should

include a sunset provision and that, prior to the sunset

date, an oversight body should review and report on the

status of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology and

the ethical and social issues associated with its use and

recommend whether the prohibition should be continued.

        (8) The Commission concluded that any regulatory or

legislative actions undertaken to effect the foregoing

prohibition should be carefully written so as not to

interfere with other important areas of research"                        such

as the cloning of human DNA sequences and cells, which

raise neither the scientific nor the ethical issues that

arise    from the possible creation of children through

somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques.

        (9) The Commission also found that cloning animals

by somatic cell nuclear transfer does not raise the same

issues implicated in attempting to use the technique to

create a child, and its continuation should only be subject

to   existing    regulations      regarding     the     humane      use     of
                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion
     animals.

     (c)     Biomedical   research   facilities,   including         those

conducting cloning, and reproductive services facilities affect

interstate commerce.

SECTION 3.     PURPOSES.-The purposes of this Act are-

     (a) To prohibit any attempt to create a human being using

somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning; and

     (b)     To provide for further review of the ethical and

scientific issues associated with the use of somatic cell

nuclear transfer in humans.

SECTION 4.     DEFINITIONS.

     (a)     "Cloning" means the production of a precise genetic

copy of a molecule (including DNA) , cell, tissue, plant, animal,

or human.

     (b) "Somatic cell" means any cell of the body other than

germ cells (eggs or sperm) .

     (c)     "Somatic cell nuclear transfer" means the transfer

of a cell nucleus from a somatic cell into an egg from which

the nucleus has been removed.

SECTION 5.     PROHIBITION.-It shall be unlawful for any person

or other legal entity, public or private, to perform or use

somatic cell nuclear transfer with the intent of introducing

the product of that transfer into a woman's womb or in any other

way creating a human being.

SECTION 6.     PROTECTED BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.-Nothing in this Act
                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion

shall restrict other areas of biomedical and agricultural

research, including important and promising work that involves:

             (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other

      cloning technologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells, and

      tissues; or

             (2)   the   use   of   somatic   cell     nuclear        transfer

      techniques to create animals.

SECTION 7.     PENALTIES.-

      (a) Any person who intentionally violates Section 5 shall

be fined the greater of $250,000 or two times the gross gain

or loss from the offense.

      (b) If a person is violating or about to violate Section

5, the Attorney General may commence a civil action in Federal

district court to enjoin such violation.

      (c) Any property, real or personal, derived from or used

to commit a violation or attempted violation of Section 5, or

any   property     traceable   to   such   property,      is     subject       to

forfeiture to the United States in accordance with the procedure

set forth in Chapter 46 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

      (d) The Attorney General of the United States shall have

exclusive enforcement authority under this Act.

SECTION 8.     EFFECTIVE DATE.-This Act shall apply to somatic

cell nuclear transfers performed within five years after the

date of its enactment.

SECTION 9.    NATIONAL BIOETHICS ADVISORY COMMISSION REPORT.-No
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

later than four and one-half years after the enactment of this

Act, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission shall report

to the President on (1) the state of the science of somatic

cell nuclear transfer;       (2)    the    ethical    and social          issues

associated with the potential use of this technology in humans;

and   (3)   the    advisability    of     continuing      the    prohibition

established by this Act.           The Commission is authorized to

continue for five years from the date of enactment for this

purpose and for other purposes as established in Executive Order

12975 and subsequent amendments to this order.

SECTION 10.       RIGHT OF ACTION.-Nothing in this Act shall be

construed to give any individual or person a private right of

action.

        (6)   NBAC also recommended that the United States

cooperate      with   other   countries   to     enforce       mutually
