     Science panel unlikely to back one U.S. food agency

        By Julie Vorman
        WASHINGTON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - A National Academy of
     Sciences panel will recommend more cooperation but no major
     changes in how a dozen U.S. federal agencies regulate food
     safety, a food manufacturers group said Monday.
        The panel, which was asked by Congress to study how the
     safety of meat, poultry, seafood, fruits, vegetables and other
     foods are regulated, has a Saturday deadline for issuing its
     long-awaited report.
        Public interest in the issue has been keen since the record
     recall of more than 25 million pounds of tainted ground beef
     last year and a series of high-profile food poisoning cases.
        Although a draft report prepared by the National Academy has
     been kept under close wraps, Rhona Applebaum, a vice president
     of the National Food Processors Association, said the report is
     likely to call for a more focused food safety policy that all
     existing agencies can use.
        "We feel very comfortable they are not going to recommend an
     agency similar to the Canadian food agency, or a single omnibus
     agency," Applebaum said. Instead, the report will urge more
     sharing of resources and cooperation among agencies, she said.
        The National Academy panel is led by Dr. John Bailar of the
     University of Chicago, with a dozen members from other U.S.
     universities, a world-renowned food safety expert from the
     Minnesota Department of Health, and a scientist from General
     Mills. Panel members have declined to discuss their report
     before it is given to Congress.
        At a public meeting last spring, several food industry
     groups urged the panel not to dismantle the current system of
     food regulation and create another bureaucracy.


   David Kessler, the former head of the FDA who is now the
dean of Yale University's medical school, is among those who
have spoken in favor of a single food safety agency. Consumer
groups have endorsed the idea to get consistent regulations and
end turf battles between agencies.
   "with so many bureaucrats in the kitchen, breakdowns can and
do occur," said Caroline Smith deWaal of the Center for Science
in the Public Interest. "Inspectors from the USDA inspect every
meat and poultry processing facility every day, but the FDA
inspects other facilities on average once every 10 years."
   Democrats have introduced a variety of food safety
legislation, including a bill that would create a new agency
dedicated to safeguarding the nation's food supply. The bill's
sponsor, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, acknowledged earlier
this year that the legislation had little chance of being
passed.
   Currently, the farmer-friendly U.S. Agriculture Department
oversees meat and poultry safety while the Food and Drug
Administration, perceived by some as more consumer-oriented,
has jurisdiction over processed foods, fruits and vegetables.
   The Commerce Department handles some seafood issues, the
Environmental Protection Agency regulates pesticide residue on
food, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control tracks foodborne
disease cases. In all, at least 12 federal agencies are
involved in food safety and inspection, each with widely
varying procedures, funding and regulations.
   For example, the manufacturing of a frozen cheese pizza is
regulated by the FDA. But a frozen pizza with pepperoni or
other kinds of meat falls under the authority of the USDA.

                           PRESIDENT CLINTON:
               SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR AMERICA'S FAMILIES

Today, at a water treatment plant near San Francisco, President Clinton announces a new measure to
ensure clean, safe drinking water for America's families. Beginning next year, water utilities must
provide regular reports to their customers on the quality aftheir drinking water. These "consumer
confidence" reports will tell families whether their water meets federal health standards -- and if not,
why not -- giving utilities additional incentive to deliver the cleanest water possible. The President also
calls on Congress to support his initiatives on clean water, public lands and global warming, and to
abandon legislative riders that would weaken environmental protections.

Safeguarding Our Drinking Water. Major refonns of the Safe Drinking Water Act proposed by
President Clinton, and passed by Congress in 1996, are strengthening protections for our drinking
water supplies. Scientific and regulatory processes are being streamlined to target contaminants that
pose the greatest risk, and communities are receiving billions of dollars in low-interest loans to upgrade
water systems. The number of Americans receiving water from systems reporting no violations of
federal health standards has grown by 10 million since 1993.

Defending Our Communities' Right to Know. One powerful tool against pollution is infonnation--
letting people know what's being put in their water and air. The Clinton administration has expanded
the number of industries required to report toxic releases, and the number of chemicals that must be
disclosed. And many companies are reducing their toxic releases as a result. Today, with a final rule
issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, this approach is being extended to drinking water.

       Beginning October 1, 1999, some 5,600 water systems serving 240 million Americans will
       provide "consumer confidence" reports at least once a year. The reports must be delivered to
       each household served, either with the water bill or in a separate mailing, and systems serving
       over 100,000 people must make them available via the Internet as well. In clear, concise
       language, the reports will:
              -Tell consumers where their water comes from and whether it meets federal drinking
              water standards.
              -Identify potential sources of any contaminants found, and potential health effects if
              standards are violated.
              -Include special health advisories for people with medical conditions such as HIV that
              weaken their immune systems, making them more vulnerable to certain contaminants.
              -Tell consumers where they can go for more infonnation on water quality.

Progress, Not Partisanship, on the Environment. To achieve further progress in protecting our
environment, President Clinton calls on Congress to: fully fund his Clean Water Action Plan to help
communities finish the job of cleaning our rivers, lakes and coastal waters; release 1998 appropriations
through the Land and Water Conservation Fund to preserve 100 natural and historic sites; approve his
proposed research and tax incentives to reduce greenhouse gas pollution; and withdraw legislative
riders that would pave our parks and refuges, cripple wildlife protections and deny taxpayers a fair
return from oil leasing on public lands.

                                                                            Automated Records Manage~ent System
