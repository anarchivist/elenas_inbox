TEXT:
FYI: As a follow-up to the meeting on INS restructuring and to expedite
the development and clearance of the INS legislative restructuring
proposal, OMB has done the following:

Faxed agency comments to INS (Eirenbaum) on the draft INS Inspector
comparability bill circulated by LRD this spring.   INS can incorporate
these changes (or work out with the commenting agency) before·the
submission of a revised restructuring/inspector pay bill.   None of the
comments were substantive -- mostly technical corrections.
Contacted Customs program officials and informed them of the fast-track
that this legislation will take next week.   They will work with INS Monday
to ensure any Customs concerns with comparability are included in the
final bill or addressed in some way prior to the final bill being sent to
OMB for clearance.
Discussed the paygo issue with BRD.   The inspector pay on the mandatory


side will be paygo unless the language is carefully crafted. With the
help of BRD, we hope to include language covering mandatory spending that
meets this standard and assure the bill has no paygo implication. The
language INS is drafting will essential say that " based on estimated
receipt levels of x -- 1999, Y - 2000, etc, obligations estimate shall not
exceed the following: FY 1999 - x, FY 2000 - y, ... FY 2003 - z."
Worked with LRD to ensure they are ready to quickly distribute and clear
the INS package (Ingrid Schroeder will coordinate for LRD).    The goal is
to get a "clean" bill to LRD early next week for quick clearance.

If you have any questions, please contact me or Ingrid.   Thanks.
