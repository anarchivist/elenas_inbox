TEXT:
FYI -- Michelle Jolin of CEA is concerned that the current plans for
Thursday's conference don't include any distribution of their report on
the importance of early childhood investments.  Since the report doesn't
have any news in it, it's hard to justify building it up very much, but
Michelle feels that since they did it specifically to help out with the
conference (at Sperling's request, I believe), it should at least be
available ...

I don't have an opinion on this (although the report seems fairly harmless
and non-controversial); what do you think?

Eli
