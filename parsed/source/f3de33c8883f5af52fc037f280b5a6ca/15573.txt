TEXT:
1.  I'm faxing over a draft of the INS/DOJ informal options memo. DOJ is
sending over a version with more legislative input later today.  I'll fax
that as soon as I get it.

2. We should try to meet briefly with Rob Malley on Monday to discuss how
we want to revise the options memo. At the meeting, we should decide a
timeframe revising the memo and at what point we want to call our first
working group meeting.  I've already received input from both Rob and
Steve about who we should invite.

3.  Rob has received a meeting request on the suspension issue by some
outside groups and immigration lawyers. He wanted to run it by us to see
if we wanted to be in on it or he should hold them off entirely for now.
He did tell them that if we met at all, we would just be listening to
their concerns, not commenting on the Administration's policy. He would
like to hear from us ASAP on whether to hold such a meeting.

4.  I have a better understanding of the litigation on suspension that was
in the papers the other day.   Main issue: how INS is counting immigrants'
length of residency in the US to determine whether they are able to meet
the 7-year residency threshold for the hardship exception.  Let's discuss
this at greater length.

5.   Have a good weekend!
