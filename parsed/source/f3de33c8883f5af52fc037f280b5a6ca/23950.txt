TEXT:
Kennedy and Mikulski are planning on introducing a food import bill, very
similar to the one that Collins was going to introduce last week.   The
Republicans have dropped off the bill.   I have sent around the bill to the
various agencies to see whether they could support an Administration
statement on the bill.   Here is what I sent around as a draft statement.
Let me know if you want to make a statement.   Thanks, Mary

The Administration supports the goal of the bill introduced today by
Senators Mikulski and Kennedy to strengthen HHSD, ability to regulate food
products offered for import into the United States.   The proposed
legislation builds on President Clinton's proposal, which was introduced
last term by Senators Mikulski, Kennedy, Durbin, Bumpers, and Byrd, and
Representatives Eshoo and Pallone, to better protect Americans from health
hazards associated with food. All Americans depend on the safety of our
food supply, and we look forward to working with members of Congress on a
bipartisan basis to improve food safety for the entire country. We need
broader authority to prohibit entry of foods that do not achieve the same
level of protection as U.S. food safety requirements.   We also need
tougher authority to control unscrupulous activities at our ports of entry
to ensure contaminated foods are not introduced into our nationD,s food
supply. The Administration looks forward to working closely with Congress
on this issue as we seek to improve our comprehensive, science-based food
safety system.
