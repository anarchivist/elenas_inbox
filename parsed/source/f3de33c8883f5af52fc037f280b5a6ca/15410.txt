TEXT:
John Hilley and vicki Radd have been contacted by Fred Graefe of Baker and
Hostetler who would like to bring Jerry Jasnowski, head of the NAM, and
Victor Schwartz into meet with us about the President's position on
products liability.  This would be a good opportunity to send our message
about the President's position to those who are on the other side of this
issue.  I am glad to set up the meeting for next Thursday or Friday unless
people have concerns. Any comments?
