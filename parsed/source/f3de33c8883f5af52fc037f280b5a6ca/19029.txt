 Q:   WHAT DO THE LATEST CBO ESTIMATES ABOUT THE MEDICARE BUY IN
      PROPOSAL MEAN?

A:    eBO recently released extremely positive estimates on the proposal for the Medicare
      buy-in. In fact, eBO assumes that this policy will help more people, and cost less than
      the Administration's initial estimates, and assumes that it will not burden Medicare Trust
      Fund. The eBO estimates that this proposal would provide coverage for 410,000
      individuals, 33 percent higher than the Administration's estimates. Moreover, they
      project that Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay less in premiums after they tum 65
      to cover the costs of the buy-in.

      These estimates validate that the Medicare buy-in proposal is a carefully targeted policy
      that will help give an extremely vulnerable group of Americans access to health insurance
      without burdening the Medicare Trust Fund.


Q:    BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL NOT BURDEN THE
      MEDICARE TRUST FUND WHEN MANY ARE SAYING THAT THIS POLICY
      WILL COST $1.4 BILLION?

A:    There is a temporary cost to the Medicare program from this policy that is paid for by the
      President's proposal through a series of anti-fraud and abuse proposals that offset the cost
      of this policy.

      Background:

      Why this policy has a temporary cost but would not impose a burden on the
      Medicare Trust Fund. As we have always said, there is a relatively modest cost to this
      proposal because participants would pay the premium in two parts: most up front (the
      base premium) and a part after they tum 65 years old (the !isk portion of the premium that
      accounts for the fact that less-than-healthier beneficiaries may be likely to opt for this
      policy). This will help these older Americans to buy into Medicare with affordable
      premiums. Medicare would in effect "loan" participants the second part of the premium
      until they reach 65 when they would make a small payment as an add on their regular
      Medicare Part B premium. That "loan" accounts for most of Medicare costs of this
      policy. Since the additional costs would be repaid with interest, this policy would not
      burden the Medicare program over the long run.]
     SAVINGS WILL PAY THE FULL TEMPORARY COSTS TO THIS PROGRAM
     RIGHT?

A:   There is a slight difference -- $300 million over five years -- that CBO assumes would not
     be fully offset by the President anti-fraud proposals. However, there are always slight
     variations in how CBO and the Administration would score these types of proposals.
     $300 million over five years is an extremely small variation for the Medicare program
     that spends nearly double that amount every day.


Q:   WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE RECENT REPORTS THAT SENATOR BREAUX
     IS ASKING THE CONGRESS TO WAIT FOR THE MEDICARE COMMISSION
     BEFORE CONSIDERING THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSAL TO OFFER
     MEDICARE FOR AMERICANS AGES 55 TO 65?

A:   These reports did not fully reflect Senator Breaux's views on this issue. Senator
     Breaux has accurately stated that the Medicare Commission has been charged with the
     responsibility of looking at this issue as well as a wide range of other issues. But Senator
     Breaux is not saying that he would explicitly stand in the way oflegislation that expands
     coverage options, such as the President's proposal.

     The President believes that this is a financially responsible and targeted policy that
     addresses a vulnerable population that the private insurance market has failed to
     serve. Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure populations: they
     have less access to and a greater risk of losing employer-based health insurance; and they
     are twice as likely to have health problems. The policies being unveiled today are paid
     for and responsible, and will help people with few affordable choices for health
     Insurance.

     While the work of the Medicare Commission will be extremely important, the
     President does not believe that the American public would sanction holding up a
     targeted, important proposal that would help hundreds of thousands of Americans
     with access to health insurance. The President is confident that as Congress examines
     the needs of this population and the proposal to address it, the necessary consensus to
     move this legislation forward will be achieved.

Q:   ISN'T THIS EXACTLY THE WRONG TIME TO PROPOSE EXPANDING
     MEDICARE -- JUST WHEN THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO MAKE
     RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL FINANCING OF THE
     PROGRAM?

A:   The legislation being unveiled today is a targeted proposal that is paid for within the
     Medicare program and therefore does not add any new burdens to the program. We
     believe this is a worthy goal that is fully consistent with the charge of the Medicare
     Commission. The Medicare Commission will be working to develop proposals for
     the overall financing of Medicare. The legislation being unveiled today will not
     conflict with the Commission's work in this area.


Q:   ISN'T THIS POLICY JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A GOVERNMENT
     TAKE-OVER OF THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM?

A.   Absolutely not. This is a carefully targeted proposal that is designed to make sure that
     older Americans have access to health care coverage. Older Americans have less access
     to employer-based health insurance, are twice as likely to have health problems, and are
     at greater risk of losing coverage. Some have no insurance options, and others are left to
     buy into the individual insurance market which can be prohibitively expensive because of
     their poorer health. This helps this vulnerable population get access to health care
     coverage by:

     Enabling Americans Ages 62 to 65 Buy into.the Medicare Program, by paying a full
     premIUm.

     Providing Vulnerable Displaced Workers over 55 Access to Medicare by offering
     those who have involuntarily lost their jobs and their health care coverage a similar
     Medicare buy-in option.

     Providing Americans Over 55 Whose Companies Reneged on Their Commitment to
     Provide Retiree Health Benefits A New Health Option, by extending (COBRA)
     coverage until age 65.


Q.   ISN'T THIS POLICY A MEDICARE ENTITLEMENT EXPANSION, AT A TIME
     WHEN MEDICARE CAN LEAST AFFORD IT?

A.   Absolutely not. Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration's
     estimates have confirmed that since participants would have to pay a full premium, there
     would be no substantial impact on Medicare.

     We have made strengthening and preserving the Medicare Trust Fund a top priority. In
     1993, the President enacted a budget -- without the vote of a single Republican -- that
     signed into law last summer extended the life of the Trust Fund at least a decade. This
     new policy is a carefully targeted policy that will in no way compromise our commitment
     to strengthen the Medicare program.



Q.   ISN'T THE COBRA POLICY YET ANOTHER EMPLOYER MANDATE THAT
     WILL DISCOURAGE EMPLOYERS FROM OFFERING HEALTH COVERAGE
     TO BEGIN WITH?

A.   The COBRA policy applies only to a small subset of firms who have dropped retiree
     health benefits after they have promised to provide them. Also, it requires retirees to pay
     a premium without an employer contribution, so the costs to the employer would be
     minimal. As a consequence, there is no reason to believe that employers will make a
     decision to drop health coverage simply because this policy exists.

            Q.   THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE PREMIUMS THAT DISPLACED WORKERS
                 WOULD PAY TO BUY INTO MEDICARE. WHAT IS THAT PREMIUM?

            A.   Displaced workers would pay one premium, that includes an add-on for any extra costs,
                 up front. This amount is still being estimated, buy will be about $400 per month.
                 Americans choosing this option would pay the entire premium without any Medicare
                 "loan," in order to ensure that Medicare does not pay excessive up-front costs and
                 participants are not burdened by expensive re-payments after they turn age 65.
