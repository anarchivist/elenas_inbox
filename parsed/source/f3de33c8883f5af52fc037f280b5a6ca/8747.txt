TEXT:
Closing data for applications for 2nd round of competitive grants was last
week.   While we don't have precise numbers yet from DOL, they received
more than 500 applications (roughly comparable to round 1).    This
indicates level of interest remains high.   DOL is shooting for mid-late
September to make awards.   Amount of awards will be comparable to round 1
 ($186 million).  DOL also mentioned that they now do not expect to have
all state formula grants approved by August 5th (there'd been some hope
they could announce the last states by the one-year anniversary of BBA and
WTW enactment).   It may take until September to work out issues with a few
states.
