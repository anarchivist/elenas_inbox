 TEXT:
 1) At today's meeting (which Elena and Christa attended) the Wichita event
 was added to the schedule, pending the outcome of the Erskine scheduling
 meeting tomorrow at 11:00. Scheduling feels strongly, and apparently
 everyone in the room agreed, that a Kansas event on November 17th means no
 non-message event with the board members on the 19th. Everyone agreed to
 hold the line with Eli. Of course nothing's final until tomorrow's
 Erskine meeting.

 2) Today, I had a long talk with the Cessna Senior VP in charge of the
 welfare to work project, which convinced me we could do a good event
 there.   My friend the former Kassebaum staffer also got a glowing report
 from her source.  However, I think we need to decide whether this is the
 Welfare to Work Partnership event we want to do in the next several
 months, given that, as currently structured, it highlights only one model
 company's effort     which are expanding; but were begun in 1990. Here
 are a few things you should know:

         a) The project is small -- 200 graduates total since it started in 1990.
 They've had 24 classes of about 15 trainees each; at their new facility
 they'll be able to double the size of the trainee class to 30. The
 trainees are welfare recipients, referred by the KanWorks program and are
 nearly all women.

         b) The event would not be a graduation, although it will be
 attended bya class that just graduated several weeks ago as well as about
 200 former trainees who are now Cessna employees. On average, former
 program trainees n,ow at Cessna earn $12 an hour, mostly as ,sheet metal
 assemblers.

         c) The event would dedicate their new facility, which the city
 owns and built with HUD loans and which Cessna rents.  There are two
 buildings -- one is a training center which has on-site child care for the
 trainees (staffed in part by AmeriCorps), and the other is a Cessna
 production site.  Cessna says they believe this is the onlx facility of
 its kind in the country (polaroid has a inner-city production plant, but
 it's apparently not as comprehensive a program).  In addition, Cessna will


 keep the old facility (across the street from the new one) as a production
 facility.

         d) Trainees get paid while in training (currently $6.50 an hour),
 receive full health and pension benefits, and are guaranteed jobs upon
 graduation. And now, the new site has temporary housing for trainees to
 live in during training.  During the training period, JTPA funds are used.
 to pay half of the trainees' wages.

         e) This effort has been the cornerstone of a larger revitalization
 effort in the 21st Street area -- thus there's a larger story to tell
 about public-private efforts to revitalize cities.

         f) In addition to the project which trains individuals for jobs at
 Cessna, they also host a clerical training program, which places
 individuals in jobs around the city (66% get placed, they say) .
