TEXT:

Carolyn says SSA has incorportated INS' input on refugee/asylees
and is ready to send out the POMS. Should go out today.

Apparently, California may be issuing regs today to implement at
least some of the welfare reform law including treatment at health
clinics. Emily, do you know more about this and whether the
President will need to address the issue while in California?
Thanks.
