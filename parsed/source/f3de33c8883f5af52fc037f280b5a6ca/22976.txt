    TITLE IX B INDIAN, NATIVE HAWAIIAN, AND ALASKA NATIVE EDUCATION

                                PART A B INDIAN EDUCATION

       Part A of Title IX of the bill would make various amendments to Part A of Title IX ofthe
ESEA, which authorizes a program of formula grants to LEAs, as well as certain demonstration
programs and related activities, to increase educational achievement of American Indian and
Alaska Native students.

        Section 901, findings and purpose rESEA, "9101 and 91021. Section 901 of the bill
would amend the statements of findings and purpose in sections 9101 and 9102 of the ESEA by
changing references to the "special educational and culturally related academic needs" of
American Indian and Alaska Native students to refer instead to their "unique educational and
culturally related academic needs".

         Section 902, grants to local educational agencies rESEA, '91121. Section 902 of the bill
would amend section 9112 of the ESEA, which authorizes formula grants to certain LEAs
educating Indian children. Current section 9112(b) provides that when an eligible LEA does not
establish the Indian parent committee required by the statute, an Indian tribe that represents at
least half of the LEA's Indian students may apply for the LEA's grant and is to be treated by the
Secretary as if it were an LEA. The amendment would codify the Department's interpretation
that, in that situation, the tribe is not subject to the statutory requirements relating to the parent
committee, maintenance of effort, or submission of its grant application to the State educational
agency for review. These requirements would be inappropriate to apply to an Indian tribe, as
they are, under section 91 13 (d), for schools operated or supported by the Bureau ofIndian
Affairs (BIA).

        Section 903, amount of grants rESEA, '9113]. Section 903(1) of the bill would make
a technical amendment to section 91 13 (b)(2) of the ESEA, which allows consortia of eligible
LEAs to apply for grants.

        Section 903(2) would revise section 9113(d), relating to grants to schools operated or
supported by the BIA, to clarify that those schools must submit an application to the Secretary
and that they are generally to be treated as LEAs for the purpose of the formula grant program,
except that they are not subject to the statutory requirements relating to parent committees,
maintenance of effort, or submission of grant applications to the State educational agency for
review. These requirements would be inappropriate to apply to these schools, as they would be
for Indian tribes that receive grants (in place of an eligible LEA) under section 91 12(b).

        Section 904, applications rESEA, '91141. Section 904(1) of the bill would amend
section 9114(b)(2)(A) of the ESEA, relating to the consistency of an LEA's comprehensive
program to meet the needs of its Indian children with certain other plans, to remove a reference to
the Goals 2000: Educate America Act (which would be consolidated into the new Title II of the

IX-A-I
                                           Hex-DUilIP ConVllllon
ESEA) and to require that the LEA's plan be consistent with State and local plans under other
provisions of the ESEA, not just plans under Title I.

        Section 904(2) would amend section 9114(c) of the ESEA to require that the local
assessment of the educational needs of its Indian students be comprehensive. This should help
ensure that these assessments provide useful guidance to LEAs and parent committees in
planning and carrying out projects.

       Section 904(3)(A) would amend ambiguous language in section 9114(c)(4)(B) of the
ESEA to clarify that a majority of each participating LEA's parent committee must be parents of
Indian children.

        Section 904(3)(B) would modify the standard for an LEA's use of funds under this
program to support a schoolwide program under Title I of the ESEA, as is permitted by section
911S(c). Under the amendment, the parent committee would have to determine that using
program funds in that manner would enhance, rather than simply not diminish, the availability of
culturally related activities for American Indian and Alaskan Native students.

       Section 90S, authorized services and activities rESEA, '911S]. Section 90S(I) ofthe
bill would make a conforming amendment to section 911S(b)(5) of the ESEA to reflect the
re-naming of the Perkins Act by P.L. 105-332.

        Section 905(4) would add four activities to the examples of authorized activities in
section 9115(b). These additions would encourage LEAs to address the needs of American
Indian and Alaskan Native students in the areas of curriculum development, creating and
implementing standards, improving student achievement, and gifted and talented education.

       Section 906, student eligibility forms rESEA, '9116]. Section 906(1) of the bill would
make technical amendments to section 9116(f) of the ESEA.

        Section 906(2) would amend section 9116(g) to permit tribal schools operating under
grants or contracts from the BIA to use either their child counts that are certified by the BIA for
purposes of receiving funds from the Bureau or to use a count of children for whom the school
has eligibility forms (commonly referred to as "506 forms") that meet the requirements of section
9116. This choice would allow these schools to avoid the burden oftwo separate child counts.

        Section 906(3) ofthe bill would add a new subsection (h) to section 9116 to allow each
LEA to select either a particular date or period (up to 31 days) to count the number of children it
will claim for purposes of receiving a grant.

       Section 907, payments rESEA, '91171. Section 907 of the bill would delete obsolete
language from section 9117 of the ESEA, relating to payment of grants to LEAs.

       Section 908, State educational agency review rESEA, '9118]. Section 908 of the bill
would rewrite section 9118 of the ESEA, relating to the submission of applications to the
Secretary and the review ofthose applications by SEAs, in its entirety. As revised, section 9118

IX-A-2
                                                    Hex-Dilmp Conversion
 would not contain current subsection (a), which requires LEAs to submit applications to the
 Secretary, since that duplicates the requirement in section 9114(a), where it logically belongs.
 The revised section would also improve the clarity of the requirement that an LEA submit its
 application to the SEA for its possible review.

          Section 909, improvement of educational opportunities for Indian children rESEA,
   '9121]. Section 909 of the bill would amend section 9121 ofthe ESEA, which authorizes
  support for a variety of projects, selected on a competitive basis, to develop, test, and
  demonstrate the effectiveness of services and programs to improve educational opportunities for
  Indian children. In particular, the bill would amend section 9121(d)(2), relating to project
  applications, to: (1) clarify that certain application requirements do not apply in the case of
  applicants for dissemination grants under subsection (d)(I)(D); and (2) require applications for
  planning, pilot, and demonstration projects to include information demonstrating that the
. program is either a research-based program or that it is a research-based program that has been
  modified to be culturally appropriate for the students who will be served, as well as a description
  of how the applicant will incorporate the proposed services into the ongoing school program
  once the grant period is over.

         Section 910, professional development rESEA, '9122]. Section 910 of the bill would
 amend section 9122 of the ESEA, which authorizes training ofIndian individuals in professions
 in which they can serve Indian people. Section 91 O( 1) of the bill would repeal section
 9122(e)(2) of the Act, which affords a preference to projects that train Indian individuals. This
 provision, which was carried over from a related program authorized before the 1994
 amendments, has no practical effect, since the only projects that have been eligible since 1994
 are those that train Indians.

         Section 910(2) would amend section 9122(h)(1), which requires individuals who receive
 training under section 9122 to perform related work that benefits Indian people or repay the
 assistance they received, so that it would continue to apply to pre-service training, but would not
 apply to in-service training. Individuals receiving in-service training are already serving Indian
 people, and that training is relatively inexpensive to the taxpayers, is generally of short duration,
 and frequently does not involve an established per-person cost of participating, such as the
 substantial tuition and fees that are charged by colleges for pre-service degree courses and
 programs.

          Section 910(3) of the bill would add to section 9122 a new authority for grants to
 consortia to provide in-service training to teachers in local educational agencies with substantial
 numbers of Indian children in their schools, so that these teachers can better meet the needs of
 Indian children in their classrooms. An eligible consortium would consist of a tribal college and
 an institution of higher education that awards a degree in education, or either or both of those
 entities along with one or more tribal schools, tribal educational agencies, or LEAs serving
 Indian children. This new authority will help ensure that classroom teachers are aware of, and
 responsive to, the unique needs of the Indian children they teach.

         Section 911, repeal of authorities rESEA, "9123,9124,9125, and 9131]. Section 911
 of the bill would repeal various sections of Part A of Title IX of the ESEA that have not been

 IX-A-3
                                       Hex-DiJmp Conversion
recently funded and for which the Administration is not requesting funds for fiscal year 2000.
The goals of these provisions (fellowships for Indian students, gifted and talented education,
tribal administrative planning and development, and adult education) are more effectively
addressed through other programs. Because Subpart 3 of Part A would be repealed, section 911"
would also redesignate the remaining subparts.

       Section 912, Federal administration rESEA, ' '9152 and 9153]. Section 912 of the bill
would make technical amendments to sections 9152 and 9153 of the ESEA, to reflect the
proposed repeal of subpart 3 and the redesignation of the remaining subparts.

       Section 913, authorization of appropriations rESEA, ' 9162]. Section 913 ofthe bill
would amend section 9162 of the ESEA to authorize appropriations for the Indian education
program under Part A of Title IX through fiscal year 2005.
