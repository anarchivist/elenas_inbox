Here's an update from the NEC.  I still don't feel confident we're back in
this loop and will continue to try to get us there.

Subject:         Re: any news on Michigan?

The only news is that the unions (with the exception of the UAW) have
grudingly agreed to a small pilot in Michigan. Therefore, Secretary
Herman is waiting for Gov. Engler to call (he is scheduled to do so) to
schedule a face-to-face meeting in Washington either later this week or
early next week.  DOL is interested in a 25% pilot which could be
configured in a number of ways.
