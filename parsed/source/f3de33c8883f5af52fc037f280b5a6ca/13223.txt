TEXT:
Good; thanks. You should know that T.J. and I also talked to Ted
this morning re the murrelet language in DOl appropriations (which
we vetoed this am, but T.J. wanted to get a better handle on that
section for round #4.)   Because the language - on its face - can
be interpreted to favor our position in court, T.J. wanted a
better explanation of Justice's concerns. Basically, we left it
with the idea that innocent though it may look, Gorton introduced
it - referencing the date he articulated the industry position on
murre lets on the Senate floor - and that in the course of
negotiations over both our timber language and DOl approps, T.J.,
Katie, et. al might want to bring this provision up directly with
Gorton and discuss its meaning.   Katie and Shelley are aware of
this discussion, also.
