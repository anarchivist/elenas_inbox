        TEXT:
        We should continue to look for opportunities to call attention to the
        risks smoking/nicotine causes fetuses.  You may have
        seen news stories about a new study presenting the first direct evidence
        that a carcinogen is transmitted from pregnant
        women who smoke to their fetuses (press release attached).  Recently
        another study linked maternal nicotine consumption
        to specific harmful brain changes in the developing fetus.  I envision a
        two prong strategy:  1) a high profile public education
        campaign about the risks smoking/nicotine causes fetuses;  2) use WIC and
        other appropriate programs to help pregnant
        women avoid smoking/nicotine.


        Study Shows Mothers Who Smoke During Pregnancy Transmit
             Cancer-Causing Substances To Newborns

              BOSTON, Aug. 24 -- The first direct evidence that a tobacco-specific
        cancer-causing substance is transmitted to
              developing fetuses when a pregnant woman smokes was revealed here
        today, at a national meeting of the
              American Chemical Society, the world's largest scientific society.
        The University of Minnesota Cancer Center
              scientist who conducted the study called the finding "an unacceptable
        risk. "

             Some 61% of smoking women who become pregnant do not quit smoking
        during pregnancy, according to a study
             published in the American Journal of Public Health (May 1990, Vol.
        80, No.5, pp. 541-544).
"




         In a first-of-its-kind study, Stephen S. Hecht, Ph.D., found
    by-products of the nicotine-derived chemical NNK in
         the first urine of babies born to smoking mothers. NNK is unique to
    tobacco and is one of the strongest
         carcinogens in tobacco smoke. This study suggests it is not only
    taken in, but processed by the fetus, Hecht said.

          Leslie L. Robison, Ph.D., who coordinates epidemiological studies
    nationwide for the Children's Cancer Group
          and is the Associate Director for population Sciences at the
    Uni versi ty of Minnesota Cancer Center, says studies
          on smoking during pregnancy have been inconclusive regarding
    childhood cancer. But he says, "to identify the
          carcinogens in the urine of a newborn is a major documentation of the
    potential role and the transmission of those
          compounds" that should give epidemiologists greater incentive for
    further study.

         Blinded samples of the first urine from 48 babies, both from smoking
    and non-smoking mothers, were sent to
         Hecht by collaborators in Germany*. Using a customized gas
    chromatography system, Hecht's laboratory found
         no NNK-metabolites in newborns of non-smokers but detected them in 22
    of 31 samples from newborns whose
         mothers smoked during pregnanc)T.

         "The results demonstrate that uptake of NNK by non-smokers begins
    before birth," says Hecht. He says this is
         particularly significant because most women who smoke during
    pregnancy continue to smoke afterward, exposing
         their children to this carcinogen for many years.

         Levels of NNK by-products in the babies were about 10% as great as in
    the urine of adult smokers. Hecht says
         this is "substantial when one considers that exposure of the
    developing fetus to NNK would have taken place
         throughout pregnancy."

         Last year Hecht reported the first evidence that NNK is found in
    non-smoking adults exposed to secondhand
         smoke in the workplace.
