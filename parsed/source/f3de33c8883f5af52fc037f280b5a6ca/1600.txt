TEXT:
Michael Waldman is not happy he wasn't at our 1:30 meeting since he'll
have to write both kick butts day speech and POTUS statement on court
decision.  Probably my oversight. He also doesn't want POTUS to slam any
advertising tactics not covered by FDA's rule -- including Joe Camel
collector packs and the Internet. Thinks that makes it clear the industry
has outsmarted us (I disagree but he didn't buy my counter-arguments).
Given that, I don't think we have enough to focus a speech exclusively on
in-your-face advertising.  That leaves us with nothing certain for kick
butts day.

If timing is right, we can use the event to expand on our response to
court decision.  If no court decision yet, I'm back at the drawing
board.   Should we push on HHS to get policy idea(s) on the table by the
end of this week so we can vet something specifically for kick butts day
and adjust our agenda once we learn of court decision?   Otherwise I'm
afraid we won't have enough to say on 4/15. Elena -- that might take a
call from you to Kevin since we didn't give them a firm deadline on policy
options.

Sorry kick butts day isn't settled yet.    Thanks for running today's
meeting and getting people focused.
