     TEXT:
     We're gathering a number of the key S&T lobbyists (about 85) together for
     a Tuesday afternoon (3/17) meeting in Room 450 OEOB to enlist their help
     on the FY99 R&D budget.  See attached draft of an event memo pasted
     below.

     In discussing this with Jim Kohlenberger, we thought this might be an
     ideal opportunity for one of you to provide this national group the
     benefit of the WH thinking/strategy on the tobacco legislation ... it would
     certainly help us in directing their efforts to swing in behind the
     cause ...

     We've built the crowd ... can OPD lend us a hand in.getting them headed in
     the right direction? If you can't, we'd be grateful for your suggestions
     of who'd you recommend as best speaker on tobacco legislation ...

     Many thanks for your consideration.

      I.        PURPOSE

     This event will highlight the AdministrationD,s determination to ensure
     Congressional passage of the AdministrationD,s FY99 R&D budget.  Science
     is at the top of the agenda for FY99 with the largest proposed funding
     increases in history for civilian R&D programs.  The Administration looks
     forward to working with legislators from both sides of the aisle to
     strengthen congressional support for science and engineering research.
     Additionally, the Administration urges support of a balanced research
     portfolio across all agencies and science disciplines.



 II.     BACKGROUND

This is an effort to reach out to leaders in the u.s. scientific community
urging their across-the-board support for the S&T budget proposal
currently working its way through the Congressional appropriations
process.  Senior Administration S&T officials will urge a give-and-take
discussion in this forum with S&T community leaders of how, together, we
might best work, beyond political and parochial concerns, to advance
support for these proposed S&T investments.

Attending will be leaders from the Science Coalition -- an alliance of
more than 400 organizations, institutions, and individuals -- dedicated to
sustaining public support for basic science. Also included are government
and public affairs directors of various scientific and academic societies,
as well as leaders of energy and environmental groups.
