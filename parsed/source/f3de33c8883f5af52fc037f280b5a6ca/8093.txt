 FROM:   OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS


 DATE:      JUNE 10, 1998

 SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


 Budget Resolution/Tax Cuts:   There is a continuing dispute between Lott
 and five Senate conservatives (Ashcroft, Grams, Bob Smith, Inhofe, and
 Brownback) about the nature of LottO,s commitment to them on taxes during
 the Senateo,s April consideration of the budget resolution.     Lott says he
 agreed to move towards the House tax cut number (which is $100 billion);
 Lott is now talking about $60-70 billion. However, in a letter they sent
 to Lott yesterday, the conservatives assert that 0& ... you promised that
 the Senate delegation would accept the larger of the tax cuts contained in
 the House and Senate budget resolutions .... You also pledged to push for a
 reconciliation bill this year and to make elimination of the marriage
 penalty a top priority.oS The conservatives say they will oppose a budget
 resolution conference report that does not include the full $100 billion.

 Reconciliation Bill: Domenici reportedly told BNA yesterday that there
 would be a reconciliation bill this year -- to do tax cuts and mandatory
 savings -- o&if we get a conference report.oS   Domenicio,s staff confirms
 that they believe there will be a reconciliation bill this year if they
 can get agreement on the budget resolution.

 Tobacco:   2d cloture attempt failed today 43-55 (17 short of the required
 60) .  A 3rd cloture vote is scheduled for Thursday at Noon.     During
 todayo,s consideration, the Senate passed by voice vote the Gramm
 amendment relating to the o&marriage penaltyoS after an attempt to table
 the amendment failed 48-50. While the 2d cloture attempt failed, Daschle
 said he is increasingly optimistic about the bill's prospects. Daschle
 said he would accept both a marriage-penalty amendment and the school
 voucher provision so long as the final version of the bill fulfills the
 principal objectives of its supporters.   Nevertheless, contentious
 amendments remain involving attorneys' fees, tobacco farmer protections
 and alternative tobacco tax proposals. Another possibility is an amendment
 by Jeffords that would establish an $8 billion annual civil liability cap
 for tobacco companies that contribute to a national fund to finance
 compensation payments to those suffering from tobacco-related illriesses.

 IRS Conference: Conferees on the IRS reform legislation had their opening
 meeting today at Senate Finance Committee (Roth is chairing the
 conference). There was no specific mention of the June 2 letter from
 Rubin which projected a $7.3 billion revenue loss in the first 5 years.
 But House Ways & Means Ranking Democrat Rangel did mention his concern
 about a $4.1 billion revenue loss from the suspension of interest and
 penalties; he also stated his concern about the substantial out year costs
 of Rotho,s IRA provisions.  Treasury staff (Talisman) tell us they believe
 one of the provisions causing the $7.3 b loss may be getting fixed, and
 they are working on the others.   Roth is aiming to wrap up the conference
 next week -- with Floor action before the recess.
