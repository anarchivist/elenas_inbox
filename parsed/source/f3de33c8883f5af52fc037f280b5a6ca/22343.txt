         The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (,PNDA "), This bill
         would outlaw discrimination in hiring, firing and promotions based
         on sexual orientation, It is designed to protect the rights of all Americans to
         participate in the job market without fear of unfair discrimination,
         The Act provides an exemption for small businesses, the Armed
         Forces, and religious organizations, including schools and other
         educational institutions that are substantially controlled or supported
         by religious organizations. The bill specifically prohibits preferential
         treatment on the basis of sexual orientation, including quotas. President
         Clinton and Vice President Gore are the first President and Vice President
         ever to back civil rights legislation for gays and lesbians. President Clinton
         originally announced his support for the legislation in October, 1995.


         The Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This measure expands the
         principal federal hate crimes statute. The current statute prohibits
         any use of force that is based on a person's race, color, religion, or
         national origin and that is intended to interfere with certain
         specified federally protected activities. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act
         would strengthen and expand the ability of the Justice Department to
         prosecute hate crimes by removing needless jurisdictional requirements
         for existing crimes. Further, it would give Federal prosecutors the power
         to prosecute hate crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation,
         gender or disability. President Clinton originally announced his support for
         the bill on November 10, 1997 at the first-ever White House Conference
         on Hate Crimes.
