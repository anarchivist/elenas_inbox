TEXT:
Elena spoke with Carol Rasco and I spoke with Scholastic and all are
agreeable to dedicating a portion of the 1 million donated books to the
prescription for reading effort.  I have scheduled a meeting for Monday
with the Academy of Pediatrics, Children's Hospitals, and Community Health
Centers, and Scholastic to move forward.

Diana      pIs do not mention knowledge of this to our friends at the Summit.

Also, Nicole got wind today that Reiner and Powell may be taping a session
on Oprah on April 15th.   Lovely. Marsha Berry is checking it out.
