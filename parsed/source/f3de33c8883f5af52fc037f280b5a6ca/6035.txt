TEXT:
We had an FMLA meeting yesterday.  Anne Lewis thinks that you and Gene
need to hold a principals level meeting to let all of the Departments
express their views on this (since the President will probably decide to
do something and most of them are against it) .. What do you think?

We also learned that there is basically no data on any of the important
questions we asked (i.e., burden to small business). Very encouraging!
