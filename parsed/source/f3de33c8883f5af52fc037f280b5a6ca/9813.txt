TEXT:
The analysis below basically says that we will need between $3.5 and $3.9
billion in 2005 in order to reach 100,000 teachers, rather than the $2.8
billion in our original proposal.  This is because this year's agreement
dropped the matching requirment (average of 20%) and also because we
assumed in our proposal that all the funds in the last two years would go
to hiring teachers, with none going to training.

In light of this, I think our best approach to releasing numbers this week
is to simply stick with the release of numbers for just this year, and
generally assert that we are on track for 100,000 without providing
particulars for the out years. If pressed, we could say that we will work
to get Congress to pass something next year that is consistent with our
original proposal, in order to finish the job.

Alternatively, we could provide the same numbers for years 2-7 that we
have been using up until now, based on our original proposal, and assert
that we will go back to Congress next year and press them to pass our
original proposal. However, I think this approach more explicitly
undermines our victory claims, because it would force us to acknowledge
that we didn't get the provisions that make our numbers work.

A third option, also undesirable from my perspective, is to put out a new
spending trajectory that will give us the $3.5-3.9 we need in the final
year in order to get to 100,000 teachers.  This approach would require us
to both highlight what we didn't get, and armwrestle with OMB over the
2005 budget.

Any other ideas?

     Mike (per your request)--

     The original "trajectory" for funding class size was as follows:



     FY 99      $l.lB

     FY 00       1.3

     FY 01       1.5

     FY 02       1.7

     FY 03       1.735

     FY 04       2.3

     FY 05       2.8

     If we assume that 10 percent of the money will go for "quality" and
     that there will ne'ver be a match, and that the $35,000 per teacher
     average holds across the States, Territories, and BIA, then we would
     start out with 30,857 teachers in 1999 and get only to 70,000
teachers
     in 2005. And it would take about $3.889 billion in 2005 to get to
     100,000 teachers.

     But remember that in our bill, in order to get the the 100,000
figure,
     we eliminated the requirement to spend 10 percent on quality after
     2003.  If we assume that, in the next round, we get through some kind
     of authorization that requires that all funds, beginning in 04, go
for
     hiring teachers, then we would reach 80,000 in 2005 and would need
     only $3.5 billion in order to make it to 100,000.

     Tom
