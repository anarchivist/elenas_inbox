TEXT:
I would envision this as a fairly brief, rather non-lawyerly piece
that simply makes the reader aware of what Hatfield says his views
are and what the report language says, and lays out any other
nefarious stuff in there and what it is as well (even if Hatfield
has not directly addressed in a contradictory manner) .
I have final report language and will get it to you shortly.
