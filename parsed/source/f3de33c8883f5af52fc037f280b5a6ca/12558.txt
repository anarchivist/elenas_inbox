                              CLOSING REMARKS
                    AT THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY SESSION
                  ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY
                              THE ROSE GARDEN
                                          May 10, 1999

         We have just concluded a very productive strategy session in the East Room here at the
White House. I'm encouraged by the many good ideas I heard ... by the many w;lYs Americans
are already working together to reduce youth violence ... and by our resolve to redouble those
efforts.

       When I first called upon this group of Americans, representing all sectors of society, I had
hoped for this sort of session. Earlier this morning, I said we wouldn't be asking who takes the
blame, but who takes responsibility. And today, the answer these leaders have given is a
powerful one: they've said, we're all in this together. We may not agree on every issue, but we
do agree on this plain and simple truth: a civilized society keeps its children safe.

       In the weeks and months ahead, as we launch our national campaign to prevent youth
violence, we will build on this strong foundation. And we will draw upon the ideas and
experiences shared at this morning's session. I know we will all think of the children who spoke
today with such bravery and maturity. We'll remember the religious leaders, the educators and,
especially, the parents struggling to give their children strong values -- struggling, at the same
time, against a swelling tide of images and ideas, sweeping into their homes and threatening to
submerge those values.

        As our national campaign gets underway, we know that we can overcome the challenges
we face by challenging ourselves to do better, to overcome old ways of thinking and of doing
business. We have seen some of that resolve already, in the support that the gun manufacturers
here today have given to our common-sense gun measures. And we have seen it in the efforts of
networks like ABC and CBS, and private family foundations like Kaiser, and agencies like the
FCC, to give parents tools like the V-Chip to protect children from violent programming.

        We know there is more that each of us can and must do. At home and at school, in
Hollywood and in the heartland, and here in Washington, we must challenge every parent, every
teacher, and every leader to step up to our responsibility.

        First, and most fundamentally, we must remember that the most important influence in a
child's life is a parent. I challenge parents to tum off the television when they don't like what
they see, keep an eye on the computer screen, and refuse to buy products that glorify violence. If

no one consumes these products, no one will produce them. Simply put, they won't build it if
you won't come.

        To the media and entertainment industries, I say this: enlist wholeheartedly in our cause,
in our national campaign. You have enormous power -- not just to entertain our children, but to
educate them. I challenge you to embrace that responsibility. Ask yourselves whether it is
really necessary to assault the eyes and ears of youth with what degrades and destroys. Consider
the consequences of what you produce. And let me say this to anyone who makes a violent
movie, CD, or video game: if you make it, at least don't market it to children.

         Finally, I urge the Congress: Step up to your responsibility. I have introduced
.Iegislation to keep guns out of the hands of both criminals and children. As this group of gun
manufacturers and sportsmen has made clear, these are common-sense measures. So I challenge
Congress: pass these gun proposals now. Give America's children the safe childhoods they
deserve.

        If Americans meet these challenges, coming together from all walks of life to seek and
share solutions, then we can truly put an end to the culture of violence -- and build in its place a
culture of values we would all be proud to pass along to our children. Thank you.

                        PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                              OPENING REMARKS
                    AT THE WHITE HOUSE STRATEGY SESSION
                  ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY
                               THE EAST ROOM
                                  May 10, 1999

        I want to welcome everyone here to the White House, and to thank you for coming to our
Strategy Session on Children, Violence, and Responsibility. This is a diverse and impressive
group: parents and children, teachers and religious leaders, law enforcement and government
officials, gun manufacturers and sportsmen, and representatives of the entertainment industry.
The Vice President, Tipper, Hillary and I wanted to bring together so many sectors of society for
a simple reason: because America's children deserve safe childhoods.

         On Friday, I announced that we would launch a national campaign to prevent youth
violence -- a grass-roots effort to involve all Americans, from every community and all walks of
life, in protecting our children from violence. I hope the ideas generated here will lay the
groundwork for that campaign, and help us to find common ground and concrete solutions.

        We're not here to debate who takes the blame, but to show who takes responsibility. I
want to be sure that the government continues to do its part. In the weeks to come, I hope to
work with Congress to pass legislation that makes our schools and streets safer, and keeps guns
out of the wrong hands. Today, I am also directing the Surgeon General to conduct a
ground-breaking study -- the first report in more than a decade on youth violence and its causes.
This report will infuse our efforts with a new urgency and understanding.

        Many of you are already stepping forward and stepping up to your responsibility. I am
pleased, first of all, that the gun manufacturers represented here today have expressed support for
several important gun measures we proposed here at the White House two weeks ago. Together,
we have found common ground on some common-sense measures: banning violent juveniles
from buying guns for life; raising the age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21; closing the gun
show loophole so criminals can't buy guns; holding reckless parents responsible for giving
children access to guns; and reducing illegal gun trafficking by helping law enforcement trace
weapons used in crimes. I commend the gun manufacturers here today for taking responsibility.

       Others have agreed to do their part. A few years ago, through the Vice President's
leadership, we were able to put in place a voluntary ratings system for television. Les Moonves,
the head of CBS, and Bob Iger, the head of ABC, have led the way by putting their networks
behind this effort; and they are here today. This year, half the new TV sets sold in America will
contain the V-Chip, which parents can use to protect their children from violent programming.

                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion


        Today, the FCC is announcing a V-Chip Task Force to make sure that next year, every new set
        contains the V -Chip; and the Kaiser Family Foundation is announcing a massive new public
        education campaign to make sure parents know about it and how to use it. Also, following this
        meeting, Kaiser and the Ad Council will produce a campaign of anti-violent ads called "Talking
        with Kids About Tough Issues."

                I am encouraged by all these efforts; and I hope everyone here will talk about the ways we
        can, together, live up to our responsibility to create a safe future for our children. I'm looking
        forward to hearing your ideas. I'm especially interested to hear what these young people have to
        say.
