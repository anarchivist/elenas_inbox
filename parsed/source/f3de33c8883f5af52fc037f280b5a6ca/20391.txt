  TEXT:
  Note Time Change to 3pm in Ann's Office

 Several of us have discussed needing to get together internally and make
 sure we're on the same page sense so many abortion related issues are
 surfacing. Chris and I talked this morning and felt we should all get
 together and discuss. at least the following:
         Medicare/Abortion
         Insurance Coverage of Abortion
 And possibly another item or two.

 We'd like for as many of us as possible to get together in Ann's office at
 3pm on Friday.
 Hope you can make it.  thanks
