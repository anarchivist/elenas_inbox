Agenda

Janet suggested on Saturday that we have an agenda to try to keep the
meeting on course. Attached is one we could use (it's written fairly
neutrally -- no mention of positions or fallback options) .

Goals of this Meeting

In my mind, our goals are to:

1) Make sure Levin et. al. understand how the formula will drive funds to
the neediest areas, and why competitive funds, while desirable for other
reasons, won't be as desirable.  Ray Uhalde is preparing a one-pager to
use to help explain this.  He promised me a fax tonight to review.

2) Ensure that Levin et. al. understand the strong effort we are making to
strike the provisions in the House bill which undermine the minimum wage,
worker protections, and the work requirements.   Seth Harris will be about
10-15 minutes late, so I put this 2nd on the agenda so he'll be there.

Janet -- will you want to raise the effort to get 41 Senate signatures to
help us gain leverage in conference?

Elena, the staff already understand that we consider the work rates part
of the parcel to strike, but the members may need to hear it from us.

Also, we may wish to raise the Nickles amendment here.  DOL is preparing
options which they could describe verbally (I've described them in the
attached).  It's premature to hand out paper, but I believe we need to
alert them that "strike Nickles" is not our first choice (althought it is
DOL's) .

3) Stress that we want the Senate anti-displacement provisions applied to


all of TANF, but have prepared options on grievance/appeals process,
remedies, and types of protections if needed.  Again, I think it's
premature to hand out paper except for the side by side of House/Senate
provisions we showed staff Saturday, but DOL will be prepared to verbally
describe options (again, I've described DOL's work in the attached.)

4) Stress that we share their view that this program's primary goal is to
move recipients promptly into private sector employment. We could offer
language to ensure that all "allowable uses" including community service
would have to have to be designed to ensure that goal.   DOL will have
possible language ready we could give them.  DOL knows that we do not
want to propose to limit the number of months of workfare or the percent
of funds spent on it.

          3) Let states choose between # 1 and #2

Remedies

          1) For anti-displacement, use Senate provisions

        2) For gender and religion, use remedies provided by laws already covered in TANF
              (Age Discrimination Act, Rehabiliation Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and
Title
                  VI of Civil Rights Act)

          3) ?Working on health and safety ideas designed to correct hazard

Nickles

       1) "States can sanction, but recipients must receive minimum wage" i.e. can sanction
through fines only.

        2) State can sanction through fines but if penalty would result in less than the minimum
wage, the person could choose to have a deduction or to write a check (this resolves some issue
with state employees)

        3) Garnishment - State can sanction by reducing the amount of a person's pay, as long as
the person making the decision to sanction cannot be the employer or the employer's employer.
They believe this preserves the principle of FLSA while allowing all government agencies except
the welfare agency to hire workfare recipients and sanction them through their paycheck.

        4)(a) Allow states to do either #1 or #3

      4)(b) Option #2, but person making the decision to sanction cannot be the employer or the
employer's employer
