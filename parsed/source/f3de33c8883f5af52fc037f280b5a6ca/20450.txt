TEXT:
There is a rumor that Linda Smith will offer an amendment today to strike
the crop insurance programs for tobacco farmers.  Our farmers dislike
this, but it would give the R's a chance to say they are leading the fight
against government support of tobacco.  Rumor that Durbin might do the
same thing in the Senate later this week.
