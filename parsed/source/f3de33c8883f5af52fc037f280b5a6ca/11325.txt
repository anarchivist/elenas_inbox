First we should put in one place the proposals we're already pushing to
help jobless young men.  For example, 20% of our welfare-to-work proposal
is dedicated to helping fathers (most of them in this age group) get
jobs. We also have a DOJ proposal we pushed at the President's request to
expand work/training for federal prisoners. Gene has more proposals in
the budget as well, and if there's a desire to come up with still more
ideas, NEC would be the right one to host a process.
