TEXT:
Eli's Kansas event is almost definite for the week of the 17th.
Scheduling is just trying to confirm an exact date    and Eli is fine with
that week.

He still wants his board to meet the President on the 19th in DC, but he
realizes the Kansas event makes it more unlikely. At Erskine's
suggestion, they tried to arrange for the board to meet the President at
the Kansas event, but they can't get all the CEOs to change their
schedule. So, it looks like Erskine wants to work it out for the 19th and
we'll have to wait and see if it's possible.
