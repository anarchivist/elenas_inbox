TEXT:
Karen Tumulty of Time is working on a piece on the Internet wiring of
schools and libraries.  She's being told by Reed Hundt that this is the
biggest thing the Federal government has done for schools since the school
lunch program.  She needs to know, first, whether that's true, and then
whatever else we can tell her.  It's a good opportunity -- it sounds like
it will be a pretty positive story.

So the question is, who ought to talk to her?   (And would we agree w"ith
that assessment??)  Her number is 861-4055.
