TEXT:
Chris Edley asked me to work with you on drafting some options for how to
present the chapter on Administration accomplishments in the President's
report.  He said that you were going to pull together folks from OMB and
NEC to think begin thinking it through.  I wanted to offer my help and see
if you would like to get a small group together next week? Thanks.
