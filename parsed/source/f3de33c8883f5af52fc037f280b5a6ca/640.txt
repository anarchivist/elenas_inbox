Subject:         Re: Budget rollout materials for welfare

Frank suggested that we get a step ahead of the curve (given the single
digit lead time on the Medicare rollout) by starting a draft just in case
a decision is made to rollout welfare as we have other items.   Keith's
group is to come up with a first draft. There is no pride of authorship,
so let's all work together on this (quietly).
