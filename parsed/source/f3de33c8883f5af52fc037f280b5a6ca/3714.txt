TEXT:
We will get the detailed copy of HHS's proposed work regs late today or
tomorrow.

HHS is sending their proposed regs in draft form to OMB today.  They've
decided to send the regs in draft form (without the Secretary's signature)
because the pending reconciliation bill will require some changes (i.e.,
voc ed, the additional penalties on states not penalizing individuals for
not working). HHS will send a formal copy once they've incorporated their
proposed reaction.  In the meantime, we can look in detail at the most
important parts.
