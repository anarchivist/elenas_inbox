TEXT:
There are two products hearings scheduled on the House side for the week
of April 7th.  In the Commerce Committee, the Tauzin Subcommittee will
hold a hearing on April 8th to look at the issue of needy patients who are
being denied medical devices due to product liability laws. They plan to
have two panels - one with patients and one with medical device
manufacturers. As you will recall, the Republicans emphasized this same
issue during an event to send last year's bill to the White House.

On April 10 the full House Judiciary Committee will hold their own hearing
on products.  I don't know any additional details on this hearing yet.

Additionally, Chairmen Bliley and Hyde have agreed to fully coordinate
their efforts on this issue during this Congress.  Consequently, there
have been a series of discussions between the House Judiciary Committee
Republican staff and the House Commerce Committee Republican staff in an
effort to craft legislation.  The discussions have centered around
legislation that would fall somewhere between the vetoed bill and the
House-passed bill from last session. However, the Republican leadership
recently decided that there should be no Republican bill at this time --
and instead ordered a series of hearings to highlight the need for reform
legislation.  In the Commerce Committee that means at least one and maybe
two more hearings after the April 8 hearing.

Finally, House Commerce Republican staff only last week began their
overtures to the Dingell staff on this issue but they realize that Mr.
Dingell very much wants legislation and they believe he can be a valuable
ally.
