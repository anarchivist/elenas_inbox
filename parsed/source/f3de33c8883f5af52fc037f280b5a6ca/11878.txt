TEXT:
The President is currently scheduled to sign the nursing homes bill on
Wednesday afternoon (2:40-2:55pm), in a closed press ceremony in the
Oval.  I think there will be a call today to determine who will attend,
ie, just members, or add in Cabinet and/or the couple from Florida (see
email below).   please let me know if you have any suggestions/comments
about who attends the bill signing.

There was also a discussion about the possibility of leaking the nursing
home piece of the Crime Bill around this bill signing (would release a WH
photo of the bill signing).  Is this something that we are ready and want
to do this week?

Rep. Davis would like to invite a couple from Florida who have helped to
spearhead this legislation. Davis is anxious to know if this is possible
since they will need to fly in for it.  I think that Jon also has some
questions about Cabinet participation.

Do you want to pull together a quick conference call today to discuss this
event?
