     TEXT:
     I am looking for proposals\outlines from groups who want to sponsor
     satellite sites by Wednesday, October 8. These do not have to be in any
     specific format but we want them to include the location, groups they are
     working with, number expecting, etc. We will then be able to create a
     list of cities where sites are being planned, possibly link groups
     together and help these organiztions build strong events.  Coordinates
     will be provided for groups to downlink, therefore, these organizations
     will have to identify sites that have existing satellite capabilities or
     they will have to bring in a mobile downlink.

     Please call me at x66614 or Laura Schwartz at x65655, if you have any
     questions. My fax number for the proposals is 456-6682

     thanks.

     Christine Stanek
