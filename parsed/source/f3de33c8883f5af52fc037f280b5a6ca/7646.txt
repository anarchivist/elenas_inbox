The Honorable Henry J. Hyde
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515


Dear Chairman Hyde:

        Today, your Committee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the O&Workforce
Improvement and Protection Act of 199808 which is intended to address the
growing demand for skilled workers in the information technology (IT)
industry. H.R. 3736 enacts a temporary increase in the annual cap on the
      ,.
number of visas for temporary foreign D&specialtyD8 workers under the H-lB
program, while also effecting reforms to the H-lB program that would help
target usage of H-lB visas to industries and employers that are actually
experiencing skill shortages.

         The Administration believes that the first response for increasing
the availability of skilled workers for industry must be increasing the
skills of u.s. workers and helping the labor market work better to match
employers with u.s. workers. Therefore, additional efforts to increase
the skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements to the H-lB
program are necessary prerequisites for the Administration to support any
short-term increase in the number of H-lB visas available for temporary
foreign workers.  Modifications to the H-lB program that appropriately
protect u.s. workers are fully consistent with the AdministrationD,s
longstanding support for legal immigration.

        We are pleased that H.R. 3736 as reported from the Immigration and
Claims Subcommittee is consistent with one of our primary objectives,
insofar as it links a temporary increase in the H-IB cap to the enactment
of meaningful reforms to the H-IB visa program. H.R. 3736 would help
ensure that u.S. workers do not lose their jobs to temporary foreign
workers and that employers have made serious efforts to recruit u.s.
workers for open positions so that qualified u.s. workers have the
opportunity to fill a job before a temporary foreign worker is hired.
Moreover, H.R. 3736 expands enforcement authority to help prevent employer
abuses of tne H-lB program. These reforms will effectively target H-lB
visas to industries experiencing skill shortages.

        Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision to
encourage additional training of U.S. workers. Training is a vital
component of our strategy to address the long-term demand for highly
skilled u.s. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness of
important u.s. industries. An effective training strategy would also work
to reduce the demand for H-lB visas. The Administration strongly supports
amending H.R. 3736 to provide for additional training opportunities for
U.S. workers and believes that this training should be funded, in part,
through a modest H-lB application fee paid by employers.

        The Administration is also concerned that the increase in the
annual number of H-lB visas reflected in this bill is too large, although
we agree that the increase should last for only three years.  In addition,
the Administration does not support provisions in the bill that would
impose occupation-based restrictions on the first 65,000 H-lB visas.

        The Administration believes that the reforms included in H.R. 3736
would substantially improve the current H-lB program. With the addition
of a meaningful training provision, a modest reduction in the level of
increase in the annual H-lB visa cap, and modifications to make the bill
consistent with u.S. international trade obligations, H.R. 3736 would
garner the AdministrationD,s strong support.  However, if amendments are
adopted that substantially weaken the reform or enforcement provisions of
H.R. 3736 or if meaningful provisions for increasing the skill levels of
U.S. workers are not adopted, the Secretary of Labor and the Attorney
General would recommend that the President veto this legislation.

        The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.

      "

Sincerely,




JANET RENO          ALEXIS HERMAN
Attorney General            Secretary of Labor
