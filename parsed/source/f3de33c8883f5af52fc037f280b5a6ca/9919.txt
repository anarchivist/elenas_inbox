I don't mean to make this complicated; I'm just trying to find a way to
make sure that our skunkworks effort to identify a couple of "bold" ideas,
or "mountain tops", are presented to POTUS as candidates for his book.
We've had truly wonderful collaborations with several NEC and DPe staff
over the last 6 weeks or so, with only certain glitches.

please understand my problem: I have essentially two people, Scott Palmer
and John Goering, covering the waterfront. And we have about 28 days until
I hope to have most of a draft completed. Rather than pull them off of
writing in order to write a special memorandum, can we take a quick look
at the draft NEe and DPe memoranda in order to make suggestions to Bruce
and Gene? Please?

My suspicion is that we will have only minor thoughts, if any,   since much
of the book will be about longer run matters.
