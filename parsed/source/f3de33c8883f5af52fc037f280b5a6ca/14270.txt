        EPA worked with several other members of the interagency salvage
        team on this draft.   I have included it verbatim, without my edits, but do want to d
        paragraph that, " agencies have already put in place some of the
        recommendations".   Please come prepared to discuss whether some
        action items likely will be implemented by the time the report is
        published, and if so, which items you expect to be in that
      . category. Thank you.

      DRAFT

      "Dear Interested Reader:
              We are pleased to present the attached Interagency Salvage
      Program Review Report, which provides an objective review of the
      administration's timber salvage activities under provisions of the


  1995 Rescissions Act known as the "salvage rider." The agencies
  have already put in place some of the Review Team's
  recommendations, and an interagency team, led by the Review Team,
  has been established and directed to develop an action plan based
  on the report's recommendations.
          In an effort to protect, restore and sustain ecological
  resources and the communities they support, in recent years the
  Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have turned
  to an ecosystem approach to land management. This approach draws
  heavily on lessons learned from the Vice President's Reinvention
  efforts. An integral part of this approach is empowering our
  staffs to establish collaborative, interagency teams to address
  environmental concerns with the best science.
          We began to improve interagency collaboration in March
  1995, when we directed our field offices to adopt a stremalined
  consultation process for National Environmental Policy Act work
  and Endangered Species Act consultation on salvge timber sales.
  This effort was expanded in May 1995.
          The passage of the salvage rider in July of that year
  temporarily exempted salvage timber sales offered by the Forest
  Service and BLM from normal environmental review and
  administrative appeals.   In signing the legislation, President
  Clinton expressed concerns about the rider's potential for adverse
  environmental effects. He directed the affected Cabinet Officers
  to exercise their discretion to continue to apply existing
  environmental laws except where explictedly prohibited. An
  interagency Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was developed to
  implement the President's directive.
          Among its commitments, the MOA required a review of salvage
  sales under the rider. Accordingly, during t~e summer of 1996, an
  interagency review team conducted a comprehensive review that
  included a field review of 15 salvage sales and a questionnaire
  that was distributed to regional and field offices of the involved
  agencies. This report summarizes the Review Team's findingsn and
  makes recommendations for the timber salvage program. Although
  the report specifically addresses adherence to the MOA, the
  findings and recommendations have significance beyond the
  expiration of the salvage rider.
          The Review Team found that some areas made outstanding
  efforts to incorporate the spirit and the letter of the MOA into
  the sales design process.   In other areas the Team found that the
  efforts needed improvement. Overall, the Review Team found that
  the MOA has been effective in creating a philosophy of interagency
  collaboration and providing an incremental step towards creating
  the processes necessary for effective collaboration.
          The most significant action the agencies should take, the
  Review Team found, is to reinforce, extend and expand the
  interagency collaborative framework.   The Team recommends that the
  collaborative process be used throughout the process of land
  management.
          We belive the Report provides some significant insights
  into how to improve our processes to be better manage the public's
  lands and the resources on them."
