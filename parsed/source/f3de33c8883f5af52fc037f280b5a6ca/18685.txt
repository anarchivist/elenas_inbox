the cases under don't ask. don't tell for 1997 on Thursday.   Among other
things, it will again show an increase in alleged violations.  They will
be briefing us on the report before its release -- on Wednesday, February
18 at 4pm in room 180 OEOB and you are welcome to attend. We will be
developing talking points after that briefing.  DOD is receiving a
separate briefing from them tomorrow.
