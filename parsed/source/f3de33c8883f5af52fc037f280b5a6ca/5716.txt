TEXT:
I think we are finally getting close on this, since OMB may actually
include a budget of a couple million doll~rs for the task force it sets
up.   The appointees with disabilities are now mounting a letter-writing
campaign to Raines, but I'm not sure it's even necessary -- Larry Matlack
says he thinks it will happen.

(The next problem will be the expectation on· the part of the appointees
that this should be in the State of the Union.   I am assuming that will be
virtually impossible, but maybe I'm thinking too small .... Anyway, they
will take it as an affront that even when they have a big issue, they're
not on the radar screen.)
