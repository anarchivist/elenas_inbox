The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. Senate
Washington D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

      The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on the Department of
Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the Senate
Subcommittee. As the Full Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

         The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's'efforts to accommodate many ofthe
Administration's priorities within the 302(b) allocation and the difficult choices made necessary
by that allocation. However, the allocation of discretionary resources available under the
Congressional Budget Resolution is simply inadequate to make the necessary investments that
our citizens need and expect. The President's FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of discretionary
spending that meet such needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making
savings proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
Congress has approved and the President has signed into law nearly $29 billion of such offsets in
appropriations legislation since 1995. The Subcommittee has made a significant step in this
direction by allowing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to collect fees for oceanic air
traffic control service, and the Administration urges the Congress to consider other similar
proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves forward. With respect to the
Transportation bill in particular, the Administration urges the Congress to consider the
President's proposal for additional aviation user fees, as well as railroad and pipeline safety and
Coast Guard fees.

        In addition, the Administration proposes to meet important safety, mobility, and
environmental requirements through the reallocation of a portion of the increased spending
resulting from higher than anticipated highway excise taxes. Under this proposal, every State
would still receive at least as much funding as was assumed when the Transportation Equity Act
for the 21 51 Century was enacted. The Subcommittee has chosen to reallocate some funding
within the highway "guarantee." The Committee is encouraged to build upon this and to
consider the Administration's proposal as a means to fund these important priorities.
Federal Aviation Administration's operations and modernization programs, reduce highway and
motor carrier safety, and under fund other important programs. The Committee could partially
accommodate the funding increases recommended below by adhering more closely to the
President's requests for High Speed Rail, Coast Guard Alteration of Bridges, Coast Guard
Acquisition, Construction and Improvements, and other programs.

       The following highlights our specific concerns with the Subcommittee bill. We look
forward to working with you to resolve these issues as the bill moves forward.

Aviation Safety and Modernization

       The Administration strongly urges the Committee to fully fund the Administration's
request for FAA Operations. The $289 million, or five-percent, reduction in the Subcommittee
bill would force the FAA to close low-level towers, defer hiring of safety and security personnel
needed to meet the demands of increased air travel, and possibly slow air travel.

        The Committee is also urged to restore the $323 million, or 14-percent, reduction to the
FAA Facilities and Equipment account. Together with the rescission of nearly $300 million
proposed by the Subcommittee for this program, this funding level would cripple the ongoing
National Airspace System modernization program. Safety and security projects would be
delayed or canceled, and critically-needed capacity enhancing projects would be postponed,
increasing future air travel delays.

        The Administration supports the Subcommittee's decision to eliminate the General Fund
subsidy for FAA Operations and to recover a portion of FAA costs through user fees. However,
we urge the Committee to enact user fees in a manner more consistent with the Administration's
proposal. This would ensure that the FAA has adequate funding should fee collections fall short
of projections.

Language Provisions

        The Administration strongly opposes the provision that would limit any State's share of
transit discretionary and formula grant funding to 12.5 percent of total funding. The
Administration and Congress worked together closely last year to ensure that transit funding is
distributed based on need. Since transit needs vary widely geographically, it would be
inappropriate to impose an "equity distribution" formula that would divert these resources from
where they are needed most.

         The Committee is requested to delete the provision that would prohibit the Coast Guard
from evaluating options for collecting fees for its services. In the future, user fees may be a
critical mechanism for ensuring that the Coast Guard has adequate resources to meet its operating
and capital needs without significantly reducing other vital transportation programs.



Livability Programs                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                2
                              Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Administration is disappointed that the Subcommittee's bill funds transit formula
grants at $212 million below the President's request. In addition, the Administration strongly
opposes the Subcommittee's action to cut the "guaranteed" funding for the Transportation
Community Preservation Pilot Program by $11 million, or 22 percent, rather than to provide the
$50 million requested by the President. These programs are important components of the
Administration's efforts to provide communities with the tools and resources needed to combat
congestion and sprawl.

Highway Safety

       The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee has provided $36 million below
the President's request for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Operation and
Research account. This reduction would curtail the Presidential Initiative for Increasing Seat
Belt Use Nationwide, behavioral research to reduce alcohol-related traffic fatalities, and the
enhanced testing proposed in the New Car Assessment program to make better car safety
information available to the public.

Motor Carrier Safety

        The Secretary of Transportation recently announced a comprehensive Motor Carrier
Safety Action Plan to implement much-needed improvements to truck safety. The need for
these improvements has been recognized by Congress, the Department of Transportation
Inspector General, and in an independent assessment conducted by former Congressman Mineta.
 The Committee is urged to provide the $56 million requested to undertake these improvements
and increase safety on our Nation's roads and highways.

Amtrak

       The Subcommittee is commended for funding Amtrak at $571 million, the President's
requested level, and providing Amtrak with the flexibility to spend capital funds wisely by
adopting for Amtrak the same definition of capital as used by transit grantees.

Job Access and Reverse Commute

        The Committee is requested to fully fund the Job Access and Reverse Commute program,
an increase of $75 million above the Subcommittee mark. This program is a critical component
of the Administration's welfare-to-work effort and is significantly over-subscribed at present.
Demand is expected to increase as more communities around the country begin to see how
effective the program can be in helping individuals make a successful transition from welfare to
work.

Office of the Secretary

        The Administration urges the Committee to provide the President's request of$63
million for the Office of the Secretary and to delete the limitation on political appointees and
other restrictions. These adjustments to the Subcommittee bill are necessary to provide the

                                                 3




        Secretary with the resources to manage the Department effectively. Also, the Committee is
        requested to restore the seven-percent reduction to the Office of Civil Rights. This reduction
        would hamper the Department's ability to enforce laws prohibiting discrimination in Federally
        operated and assisted transportation programs.


               We look forward to working with the Committee to address our mutual concerns.

                                                    Sincerely,




                                                    Jacob J. Lew
