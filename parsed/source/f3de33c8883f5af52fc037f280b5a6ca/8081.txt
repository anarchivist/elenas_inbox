    TEXT:
    The House and Senate Ag approps food safety numbers are in and we did
    poorly . . As you may recall, our request was for a $101M increase ($91M
    from Ag approps for USDA and FDA, and $10M from HHS approps for CDC) .
    Senate Ag approps marked up yesterday and provided $0 increase for FDA and
    USDA for food safety. House Ag approps marked up today and gave FDA only
    $9M (it may be worse than that because I believe they cut FDA by $9M
    elsewhere in its budget).    USDA received only $6M.  So to recap: we asked
    for $91M from Ag approps, the Senate gave us $0, the House gave us $15.
