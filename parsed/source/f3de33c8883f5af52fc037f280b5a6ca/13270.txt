TEXT:
TJ is certainly correct in so far as his assessment that the
language has not gotten around yet.
That reminds me: did you ever get the "minor technical change"
into the word processor at OMB and out again? I feel no
compelling need to have a copy right now, but at least one of us
who is regularly plugged into these discussions should have a
clean copy of the latest version handy.
The thought about a change in "like kind and volume" comes from
discussions that Tom Tuchmann, head of the Interagency Office of
Forestry and Economic Development in Portland had with several
people, including T.J. and myself, yesterday. Tom had a joint
visit recently by one of the Umpqua sale purchasers and an
environmentalist. The purchaser expressed concern about the
controversy over the sale under the "original terms" and also had
come to the realization that "like kind" was going to be equally
difficult to come by without a "like" degree of controversy over
environmental impacts. Apparently, after having long talks with
his environmentalist friend, he had come to the idea of accepting
replacement timber that wouldn't necessarily be of like kind.   In
the course of the discussion, there were suggestion that other
purchasers of the really controversial sales were beginning to
feel the public heat and might be amenable to something other than
the stric.t terms of the current statute. The other thought
expressed during these disucssions was a willingness to explore a
much longer time period than 45 days (the industry side is set to
argue that we must provide replacement timber also within 45 days,
although the rider is not specific on that point.)
