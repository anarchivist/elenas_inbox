TEXT:
Richard Socarides told me that we may be facing a rider on the DC approps
bill to ban gay adoption. Michael Deutsch thought we might need to weigh
in with the key Dem appropriators, Boxer and Moran, to let them know we
would strongly oppose this.

I recall    having a long conversation about this issue with Melanne about a
year ago,    after some state (Mass? NJ?) did this.   She talked to HRC and
affirmed    that the Clintons' view was that adoption should be a local
decision,    whatever is in the best interest of the child, etc.

Could you check with Richard and Michael and figure out what we can do to
be helpful here? Thanks.
