    Q:   What did the President announce today?

    A:   The President announced a final rule to require a new universal wayJor installing child
         safety seats in cars and light trucks. Currently, parents use the vehicle seat belts to install
         child seats. There are a variety of models of child seats and they require different
         methods for installation. Parents have found attaching child safety seats using the
         vehicle's seat belts often is cumbersome and difficult. In the future, each new child seat
         will have three attachments (one top tether and two at its base). New cars and light
         trucks will be equipped with standard anchors in the back seat designed specifically to
         link to the child seat attachments. Each system will consist of a ready-to-use, visible
         and accessible upper anchorage to which the child seat tether hardware will attach. The
         vehicle seat will have two one-inch long bars spaced a foot apart and positioned where
         the vehicle seat cushion and seat back meet to which the child seat lower hardware will
         attach.

    Q:   How many lives will this rule save?       How many injuries will this rule prevent?

    A:   Annually, motor vehicle crashes result in 600 child fatalities and 70,000 injuries for
         children less than five years old. Even though child safety seats are very effective in
         reducing death and injury, their effectiveness is substantially reduced due to incorrect use
         and occasional incompatibility with the vehicle seat and belt systems. This rule is
         expected to prevent as many as 50 child deaths and 20,000 injuries each year.

    Q:   When will this rule take effect for cars and light trucks? For child seats?

    A:   For vehicles, eighty percent of new cars will be equipped with the top tether attachment
         points starting September 1, 1999. All new vehicles (cars and light trucks) will be
         equipped with the top tether attachment points by September 1, 2000. The lower
         anchorages are phased in over 3 years, covering 20% of vehicles beginning September 1,
         2000,50% of vehicles by September 1, 2001, and all vehicles after September 1, 2002.

         For the child seats, starting September 1, 1999, all new child seats will be equipped with
         an upper tether. All new child seats will be equipped with the two lower attachments by
         September 1, 2002. New child seats will also remain installable with regular vehicle seat
         belts to assure compatibility with older vehicles and aircraft.


    Q.   How effective are child safety seats?

    A.   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), when


                                                    1
     toddlers by over half.

                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
Q:   How much will child seats increase in price as a result of this rule? How much will
     vehicle prices increase?

A:   According to NHTSA, the additional amount that consumers will have to spend on a new
     child seat will be as low as $15. Typically, child safety seats range in price from $50 to
     $100. The vehicle additional cost is estimated at between $3 and $7.


Q:   What previous efforts has the Administration taken to address this problem?
                                                                                     -
A:   On October 13, 1993, the Federal vehicle occupant protection standard was amended to
     require, effective September 1, 1995, that vehicle seat belts on new passenger vehicles be
     lockable to tightly secure child seats.

     In February 1995, the Department of Transportation set up a Blue Ribbon Panel of
     experts to recommend ways to install and use child safety seats. In May 1995, the Panel
     recommended the evaluation and development of a universal system to attach child safety
     seats.

     In February 1997, the President announced the proposed rule regarding child safety seats
     in his weekly radio address. Today's announcement reflects comments the Department
     of Transportation received in order to improve the safety and provide one universal
     method of installing the child seats.


Q:   How does this differ from what the Administration proposed earlier?

A:   The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), announced by the President on February
     15, 1997, proposed that every vehicle and child safety seat be equipped with either
     dedicated "mini-seat belts" solely for installing child safety seats, or two fixed rigid
     one-inch bars in the vehicle's back seat to which a child seat would attach with a variety
     of types of connectors. The final rule requires solely the latter approach. People
     commenting on the NPRM overwhelmingly favored having the government deciding on
     one attachment system. The final rule and NPRM are similar as to the requirements for
     vehicle to accommodate an upper tether attachment for the child seat.

                     PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW RULE
                   TO IMPROVE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN VEHICLES
                                  February 27, 1998

In his radio address today, President Clinton will announce a major step to protect our traveling
children -- a new rule requiring a single standardized system for installing child safety seats in
cars and light trucks. Under the rule, each new child seat will have three attachments -- one on
top and two at the base. All new cars and light trucks will required to be equipped with standard
anchors in the back seat designed specifically to link to the child seat attachments. The rule is
expected to prevent as many as fifty child deaths and 20,000 injuries each year.

New Rule Makes Installation Easier and Will Save Lives
Currently, installing a child safety seat is complicated by the fact that there are over a hundred
models of child seats requiring many different methods for installation in over 900 models of
passenger cars now on the road. Moreover, not all models of car seats fit in all models of
vehicles. Even when child seats do fit, the current method uses the vehicle seat belts to install
child seats, which is often a cumbersome process because seat belt designs are built for adult
protection not child seat installation. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, over 70 percent of children strapped into safety seats are at risk because those
seats are improperly installed.

How the New System Works
For the child safety seats, there will be three attachments, a tether on top and two at the base.
For
vehicles, new standard anchors will be installed in the back seat which are designed to link to the
new child seat attachments. Typically, vehicles will be required to install 2 systems in the rear
seat so that two child seats can be anchored. Each system will consist of a ready-to-use, visible
and accessible upper anchorage to which the child seat tether hardware will attach. The vehicle
seat will have two one-inch long bars spaced a foot apart and positioned where the vehicle seat
cushion and seat back meet to which the child seat lower hardware will attach.

Effective Date of Rule for Vehicles and Child Seats
For vehicles, eighty percent of new cars will be equipped with the top tether attachment points
starting September 1, 1999. All new vehicles (cars and light trucks) will be equipped with the
top tether attachment points by September 1, 2000. The lower anchorages are phased in over 3
years, covering 20% of vehicles beginning September 1,2000,50% of vehicles by September 1,
2001, and all vehicles after September 1,2002.

For the child seats, starting September 1, 1999, all new child seats will be equipped with an
upper tether. All new child seats will be equipped with the two lower attachments by September
1, 2002. New child seats will also remain install able with regular vehicle seat belts to assure
compatibility with older vehicles and aircraft.

Builds on the President's Efforts to Protect Children in Vehicles
This step is one of a series of actions by President Clinton to promote safety for children on the

        road. Two years ago, on February 15, 1997, the President announced the proposed rule regarding
        child safety seats in his weekly radio address. Today's announcement reflects comments the
        Department of Transportation received in order to improve the safety and provide one universal
        method of installing the child seats. On November 19, 1998, the Administration announced a
        Blue Ribbon Passenger Safety Panel that will recommend strategies to increase the use of booster
        seats for children 4 to 8 years and the use of seat belts for children 8 to 16 years. This group of
        children typically is currently not covered by state child seat use laws.
