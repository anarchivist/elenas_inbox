TEXT:
Thank you again for your time yesterday (and the needed exercise!)  I hope
it isn't asking too much to see if you have more time -- Lisa Kountoupes
(who handles tobacco on the House side) and I would like to sit down with
you on tobacco, when it's convenient.  I think she's already gotten
several calls from Waxman et al on where we're going.

I'm flexible and am quite free, as of now, next week.

Thanks.
