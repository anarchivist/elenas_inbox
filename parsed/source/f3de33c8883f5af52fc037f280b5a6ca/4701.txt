TEXT:
I checked with George at DoJ and Zeller at FDA on the timing of the 4th
Circuit decision. Both agreed we won't be able to do more than guess when
a decision might come. Mitch said FDA lawyers have found that the 4th
Circuit usually takes 6 to 9 months to issue a decision. Oral arguments
were on August 11. George said the October date was merely a point in
time where we should be prepared for a decision, based on the 4th Circuit
granting expedited review, but has no view on when a decision most likely
will be issued. Coincidentally, DoJ and HHS are meeting tomorrow to
discuss the court's pending decision.  I will try to attend.
