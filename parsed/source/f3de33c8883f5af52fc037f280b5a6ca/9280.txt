                                  H-2A Discussion Document

The purpose of to day's meeting is to determine general Administration guidelines for H-2A
reform.

Background

        Agricultural "guestworkers" are admitted on H-2A visas for temporary jobs. Under the
current program, in order hire H-2A workers, an employer must demonstrate to the DOL that (a)
there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to perform the
services; and (b) there will be no adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of
similarly-employed U.S. workers. Employers also are required to pay workers an "adverse
effect wage rate" (AEWR), determined by the average wage paid to non-managerial agricultural
workers in the state; provide free housing to workers outside the commuting area; reimburse
workers' inbound transportation if they complete half the contract, outbound also if they
complete the contract; guarantee 3/4 of the hours of the contract; and hire any qualified U.S.
worker who applies during the first half of the work contract. There is no cap on the number of
H-2A visas granted. Out of the 1.6 million farmworkers in the United States, approximately
600,000 are unauthorized to work, and approximately 20,000 are in the H-2A program.

       In June 1995, in response to efforts in Congress to pass legislation that would create a
new guestworker program (without the worker protections present in the existing program) and
agreeing with the recommendation of the Commission on Immigration Reform, the President
stated his opposition to a "new guestworker program." However, he also stated that if the
crackdown on illegal immigration contributes to labor shortages, he would direct the
Departments of Labor and Agriculture to work cooperatively to improve and enhance the existing
H-2A program.

        Grower advocates argue that they continue to experience difficulties in finding domestic
farmworkers and that the H-2A program is slow, cumbersome, and expensive. However, a
recent (December 1997) GAO study concluded that agribusiness does not now and will not soon
face an agricultural labor shortage. The GAO's finding of a labor surplus echoes the
conclusions ofthe U.S. Commission on Agricultural Workers (1992), and the U.S. Commission
on Immigration Reform reports (1995 and 1997). While the GAO report suggested that there
could develop localized labor shortages, it noted the widespread beliefthat employers should
respond to the market place by increasing wages, improving recruitment and modernizing their
labor practices. Further, the GAO report cited a study which concluded that substantial wage
increases would have little effect on consumer produce prices or international competitiveness.
Many growers blame the INS's recent crackdown on undocumented farmworkers for the
shortages of domestic farmworkers and their need to rely on a dysfunctional H-2A program.

        On March 12th of this year, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration approved
legislation, sponsored by Rep. Robert Smith (R-OR), that provides for a new pilot guestworker
program that erodes existing worker protections. In a letter to Chairman Lamar Smith, Secretary
                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
veto. This bill was voted out ofthe subcommittee on a voice vote, but has not been taken to the
full House Judiciary Committee.

        Soon after this bill was introduced, we initiated a process with the Departments of Labor
and Agriculture to determine what kinds of regulatory and/or administrative reforms we could
put into place before the next growing season. We developed a set of regulatory reforms that
respond to the growers' concern that the program needs to be streamlined (i.e., improved
processes; reduced paperwork and delay). The Department of Labor and the Justice Department
(which handles the immigration aspects of the program) have developed a package of proposed
rulemaking changes that we hope will go in effect by the end of January. However, though
some grower advocates were pleased with the set of administrative reforms, they continue to
press for a legislative package that would fundamentally alter the way the program is operated.

        On July 22, 1998, Senators Ron Wyden, Bob Graham and Gordon Smith (R-OR)
introduced an amendment to the CJS appropriations bill that would make significant changes to
the current H-2A program. On that same day, the Secretary of Labor sent a letter to Senator
Wyden stating her strong opposition to his amendment which creates a new guestworker program
that erodes labor protections for migrant farmworkers. The overall concern with the
Wyden-Graham bill is that it shifts costs and risks from employers to workers and/or the
government.

Issues Regarding H-2A Reform

Issue #1
Use of the Adverse Effect Wage Rate
Whether we would consider eliminating the adverse effect wage rate and replacing it with an
enhanced prevailing wage rate.

Current Law:

Under the current program, growers who employ H-2A workers are required to pay their workers
the higher of the prevailing wage (determined by the average wage for the crop in the local area),
the federal, state or local minimum wage or an "adverse effect wage rate" (AEWR) (equal to the
average statewide agricultural wage rate). Because foreign workers can sometimes dominate a
local labor market, this wage depression is often reflected in the local prevailing wage. The
AEWR partially corrects for this depressive effect by measuring farmworker wages on a
statewide basis -- thus dissipating the impact of foreign workers on the wage.

Wyden-Graham Bill:

Under the Wyden-Graham bill, the worker is required to be paid either the prevailing wage or the
AEWR (capped at 105% of the prevailing wage).

                                                             Hex-DlIIDp Conversion
Employer Recruitment -- Use of Proposed Registry
Whether we support the creation of a registry system for matching growers to farmworkers that
totally replaces an employer's obligation to conduct positive recruitment.

Current Law:

Under current law, if the grower is seeking to employ H-2A workers, he must affirmatively
recruit in the private marketplace (know as "positive recruitment") and use the federal-state Job
Service to circulate job offers to areas where migrant workers may be located. Thus, the
responsibility for farmworker recruitment is shared between the prospective employer and the
U.S. Employment Service.

Wyden-Graham Bill:

Under the Wyden-Graham bill, growers seeking to employ H-2A workers would have no
obligation to attempt to recruit legal U.S. farmworkers except through a newly-created "job
registry." Thus, all responsibility for the recruitment of domestic farmworkers would shift to a
new, untried, process for which the government and low-wage workers are entirely responsible.
This registry would take years to create, but H-2A workers could be hired within 6 months of the
enactment of the bill. Further, because growers would no longer have an obligation to recruit
domestically, they would be free to concentrate their worker recruitment efforts abroad.

Issue #3
Housing
Whether H-2A employers should continue to have an obligation to provide housing to their
workers. Also, whether this obligation is met by the issuance of housing vouchers.

Current Law:

Current law requires growers who employ H-2A workers to provide them with free housing.

Wyden-Graham Bill:

The Wyden-Graham bill allows growers to provide a payment voucher (equal to 114 of the Fair
Market Rate in the applicable county for a two bedroom apartment) in lieu of housing, unless the
State certifies that adequate housing is not available in the area. Under this approach, the
grower employing H-2A workers would have no obligation to assure that housing is actually
available and could be obtained with the voucher.

Issue #4
The 3/4 Guarantee
Whether we support the continued use of the 3/4 guarantee.

Current Law:
                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
they were recruited, except when there is an "act of God." This "three-fourths guarantee" gives
migrant workers some indication of their potential earnings and discourages employers from
over-recruiting to secure a labor surplus and drive down wages. Under the MSPA (which
applies to U.S. migrant farmworkers, but not H-2A workers), workers enjoy a 100% guarantee.

Wyden-Graham Bill:

The Wyden-Graham bill would eliminate this work guarantee for H-2A workers. This change
will encourage growers to lure workers from hundreds or thousands of miles away with the
promise of potentially high earnings without any obligation to fulfill any part of that promise.
This may also encourage growers to recruit more workers than they actually need to hedge
against uncertainties.

Issue #5
Repatriation Incentive
Whether we support wage-withholding as an incentive for H-2A workers to repatriate.

Current Law:

Under current law, there is no mechanism for ensuring that H-2A workers return to their home
country.

Wyden-Graham Bill:

Permits employers to withhold 20% of a worker's wages, to be reclaimed upon the worker's
return to his home country.

Issue #6
Transportation Reimbursement
Whether employers should continue to be required to provide reimbursement to workers for
inbound transportation if they complete 50% of the contract, and for outbound transportation if
they complete 100% ofthe contract.

Current Law:

Under current law, the employer must reimburse the H-2A worker for inbound transportation
costs if the worker completes 50% of the contract and for outbound transportation costs if the
worker completes 100% of the contract.

Wyden-Graham Bill:

Under the Wyden-Graham proposal, workers may receive such reimbursement from their
employer, but the employer is under no obligation to pay. This change would simply shift the
cost of transportation to and from the job from the grower to the worker.
