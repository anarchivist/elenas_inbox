                    PRESENTATION OF THE CLONING REPORT

                            DATE:               June 9,1997
                            LOCATION:           Rose Garden
                            BRIEFING TIME:      11:00 am -11:30 am
                            EVENT TIME:         11:30 am -12:10 am
                            FROM:               Jack Gibbons, Elena Kagan

I.     PURPOSE

To receive the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) report on the possible
cloning of human beings, and to announce your response to the NBAC recommendations.

II.    BACKGROUND

In February, following reports of the first successful cloning of an adult sheep, you asked
NBAC to review the profound ethical issues raised by the possible cloning of human beings.
 At this event, Dr. Harold Shapiro, the Chair of the Commission and President of
Princeton University, will formally present you with its report.

NBAC unanimously concluded that it is morally unacceptable at this time to create a child
by using the technology that created Dolly the sheep. The Commission also found that the
cloning of DNA, cells, tissues, and animals using somatic cell nuclear transfer and other
cloning techniques is not ethically problematic, may have many agricultural and medical
benefits, and should not be banned. The Commission chose not to address at all issues
related to embryo research, including the cloning of embryos for research purposes. The
legislation recommended by the Commission bans the "Dolly" technology only when used
for the purposes of creating human beings.

You will be making the following          announcements     to   respond   to the NBAC
    recommendations:

             Propose legislation prohibiting the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to
             create a human being. The legislation also directs NBAC to report back in 4
             Y2 years on whether to continue the ban.
             Keep in effect the moratorium you put in place in March so that while
             legislation is pending no federal funds will be used to clone human beings,
             Urge privately-funded scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary
                                                                              -,e~-[J~i11p Conversion

              moratorium you called for in March while legislation is pending.
