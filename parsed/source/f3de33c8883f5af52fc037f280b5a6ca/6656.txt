Subject:         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE VACANCIES CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1998

FYI -- Chairman Hyde yesterday intdoduced the subject bill as H.R. 3420.
His remarks upon introducing the bill (including a description of the
bill) are shown below.
     Mr. HYDE. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the 'Department of
Justice Vacancies
     Clarification Act of 1998.' This legislation will end the practice of
appointing acting
     personnel for indefinite periods of time to important jobs in the Depa
rtment of Justice. For
     too long, the Department of Justice has used this method to evade the
.,.

      political
           accountability provided by the Senate confirmation process.

           In 1988, Congress reenacted the Vacancies Act to prevent the filling
      of Executive Branch
           positions with acting personnel for long periods. Generally speaking,
      the Vacancies Act
           says that a person may serve as an acting head of an office for no
      more than 120 days. 5
           U.S.C. 3348. (These times are tolled while a nomination is pending or
      when Congress has
           adjourned sine die.)

            Most organic statutes for government departments have language that
      says the head of the
            agency may delegate his functions to anyone within the Department.
      See, e.g., 28 U.S.C.
            509-10 (language for the Department of Justice). Both Democrats and
      Republicans in the
            Executive Branch have interpreted this kind of language to be an
      alternative method of filling
          . vacancies that is not subject to the 120-day period provided in the
      Vacancies Act. That
            interpretation effectively nullifies the Vacancies Act.

            The Department of Justice vacancies Clarification Act of 1998 would
      make it clear that the
            general language in the Department of Justice statute is not intended
      to override the
            Vacancies Act and that the Vacancies Act is the only method for
      filling vacancies in the
            Department of Justice.

           In addition, to insure that the language is not ignored, the Act
      provides that when any acting
           person serves beyond the time provided in the Vacancies Act, the
      United States Circuit
           Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit will step in to
      appoint someone to fill
           the job until someone is nominated and confirmed. The Court could not
      appoint a person
           who had previously served as an acting head for that particular
      vacancy or a person who
           was nominated, but did not get confirmed. This is similar to language
      that already exists with
           respect to United States Attorney positions. 28 U.S.C. 546. My intent
      is not so much that
           the Court ought to make such appointments, but to give the Executive
      Branch an incentive
           not to let the time lapse.

           I believe that this legislation will clarify the law, vindicate our
      system of checks and
           balances, and be to the advantage of all concerned. I hope that all
      of my colleagues will
           support it.
