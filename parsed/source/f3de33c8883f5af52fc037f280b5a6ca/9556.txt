TEXT:
According to the DOL, yesterday's 5pm meeting between Lamar and the Rep.
Leadership turned out to be a meeting between Lamar and Bob Smith.   B.
Smith asked Lamar to support the Wyden-Graham bill.   Lamar said no, but
that he would -- as he has said before -- support B. Smith's pilot
program. According to DOL, the decision about how to proceed with this
issue will be a leadership call in the next few days.   Also according to
DOL, the Agriculture Approps bill has closed, and is no longer a
possibility as a vehicle.
