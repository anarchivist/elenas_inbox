TEXT:
           Although resolving the bifurcation issue should probably be our
           top priority this week (see the letter from NGA/NCSL/APWA), here
           are 2 unresolved welfare issues we are letting languish:

           1.  Allor none:     HHS prefers the "all or none" position to the
           "pick and choose" position, and is waiting to hear from us.    I
           believe everyone here except Ken prefers "pick and choose." We
           need to resolve this, since states are making these choices.     Ken
           and Chris were supposed to have a conversation to compare
           approaches here ... has that happened?

           2.  Cost neutrality for child support pass-through waivers:   we
           are waiting to hear from OMB on this one.  HHS's position is that
           states that pass along the benefits to families should be allowed
           to continue their waivers, while those that don't should not.

           Other issues:

                  On bifurcation, HHS will give us paper very soon; we need
           to know our position. NGA is pressing hard to resolve this
before
           its meeting.

                  We need to sort out what we've done on the bucket
           budget-wise -- I think the budget essentially decided this.

                  We need a decision on a day for children's SSI      Ken and
I
           think -it has to be the end of this week or the beginning of next
           because of Chater' s depa·rture on 1/31.

                  FYI, we are planning to meet w/NGA/NCSL/APWA tomorrow at 1
           after a long hiatus.  Should be a pleasant discussion of
           bifurcation.
