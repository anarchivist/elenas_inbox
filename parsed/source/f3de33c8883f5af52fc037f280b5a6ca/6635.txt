TEXT:
BR/EK:

Ed pitched a fit about leaking the School Safety report.  They claimed we
couldn't leak the #s because they're not Ed's, but an independent agency's
(the National Center for Education Statistics).  I suggested we at least
let Rahm leak the outline and strategy for addressing school violence
(which references the upcoming relevant reports (but not the stats), how
they'll be pulled together every year now, etc., but Ed didn't think this
was sufficiently newsworthy.

Rahm wasn't pleased, but agreed with Ed that the outline/strategy without
the stats wasn't news.  However, he said he didn't want to push Riley on
this.  Instead he suggested that, we try and do a quick Oval Office event
Wednesday, just before the AFL-CIO.   I think Ed would be much more
supportive of this, but don't know how likely this is to happen.

Beaten,
Jose'
