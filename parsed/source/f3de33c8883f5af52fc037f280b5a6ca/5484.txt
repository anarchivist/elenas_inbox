TEXT:
On Monday, (from 8:30 to 1:00) I am attending a conference at the
Brookings Institute on Immigration, and will therefore be absent from the
Monday a.m. meeting.  Commissioner Meissner, Lamar Smith and Mel Watt are
panelists, to discuss the CIR report, Americanization, future of INS etc.
It should be a hoot.
