          This is a draft agenda for the first meeting of the Food Safety Council
          (not for the public meeting tomorrow) .  The first meeting of the Council
          has not been scheduled yet, but we discussed having it sometime in October
          or November. Cliff has drafted an agenda with Bruce speaking for 10
          minutes on the executive order creating the Council (and to emphasize the
          President's commitment). Bruce, are you OK with speaking? Thanks, Mary

          Please get your comments to me by COB today if possible on the following
          draft agenda for the first council meeting.  Please comment on whether you
          think this meeting should be open or closed.  If we talk seriously about
          budgets at least that portion needs to be closed- -right OMB? I have a
          conference call with woteki and O'Hara tomorrow to discuss this.   Thanks

    I also just got a phone call from Waxman's staff about this issue.

    How much do we want to tell them? That we would be willing to accept a
    provision that included the NGA/McCain menu so long as it was paid for,
    but that we are not pushing it?

    And who should return these calls? Bruce? Chris? Me? The Conrad call was
    from Tom Mahr and the Waxman call was from Karen Lightfoot.

    Subject: Tobacco: MCO federal share amendment.

    Tom Mahr called to check on the WH view on enacting language to enable
    states to keep the federal MCO share from state tobacco suits. As you may
    know, there are rumors about members adding such language to the omnibus
    budget bill.   Conrad has several concerns:  1) what would be the offset;
    2) any provision should be limited to the 4 states that have settled -- to
    hold down the cost, and to keep this issue alive as an engine for tobacco
    legislation next year; 3)  a majority of what would have been the federal
    share should go for state tobacco control.  Conrad is considering speaking
    out on this subject and is considering generating a congressional letter.
    He would like to know the WH position before he makes his next move.   How
    should we respond? Thanks.
