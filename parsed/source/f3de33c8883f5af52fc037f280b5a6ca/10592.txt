TEXT:
Before this afternoon's event, the President asked John about the status
of the America Reads program and expressed interest in getting an update
on it. John asked me to see if you would prepare a brief update memo for
the President. Please let me know what your timing will be on getting it
in to the President.

Also, the President asked John which two states had not adopted academic
standards.  Can you e-mail which ones so I can let John know? Thanks a
lot.
