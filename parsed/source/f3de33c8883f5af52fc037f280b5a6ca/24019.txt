The Honorable C.W. Bill Young
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       The purpose ofthis letter is to provide the Administration's views on the Transportation
and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the House Subcommittee.
As the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the Administration's
views would be appreciated.

       The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's efforts to accommodate many of the
Administration's priorities within its 302(b) allocation. However, the Administration is
concerned about some of the choices made necessary by this allocation.

        The President's FY 2000 Budget proposed levels of discretionary spending that meet
important national needs while conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making
savings proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help finance vital spending
needs. Congress has approved and the President has signed into law nearly $29 billion of such
offsets in appropriations legislation since 1995. The Administration urges the Congress to
consider our user fee proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves forward. In
particular, with respect to this bill, the Administration urges the Congress to consider our
proposals such as aviation user fees.

        The Administration proposes to meet important safety, mobility, and environmental
requirements by reallocating a portion of the increased spending permitted by higher-than-
anticipated highway excise taxes. Under this proposal, every State would receive at least as
much funding as was assumed when the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century was
enacted. Last year, Congress chose to reallocate some funding within the highway "guarantee."
The Committee is encouraged to build upon this by enacting the Administration's proposal as a
means to fund these important priorities.

        The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee bill could compromise the
Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) operations and modernization programs, reduce
highway and motor carrier safety, and underfund other important programs. The Committee
could partially accommodate the funding increases recommended below by adhering more
closely to the President's request for the Airport Improvement Program, High Speed Rail, Coast
Guard Alteration of Bridges, the Coast Guard capital acquisition program, and other programs.
forward to working with you to resolve these issues as the bill moves forward.

Aviation Safety and Modernization

        The Administration strongly urges the Committee to fully fund the Administration's
request for FAA Operations. The $114 million, or two-percent, reduction made by the
Subcommittee would force the FAA to close low-level towers, defer hiring of safety and security
personnel needed to meet the demands of increased air travel, and possibly slow air travel. The
Committee is also urged to restore the $119 million, or five-percent, reduction to the FAA
Facilities and Equipment account. The Subcommittee's funding level would undermine our
National Airspace System modernization program. Safety projects as well as critically-needed
capacity enhancing projects would be delayed, increasing future air travel delays.

        The Administration supports the Subcommittee's decision to eliminate the General Fund
subsidy for FAA Operations but urges the Congress to enact a user fee system to finance the
agency. Such a system would improve the FAA's efficiency and effectiveness by creating new
incentives for it to operate in a business-like manner.

Motor Carrier Safety

        The Secretary of Transportation recently announced a comprehensive Motor Carrier
Safety Action Plan to implement much-needed improvements to truck safety. The need for
these improvements has been recognized by Congress, the Department of Transportation
Inspector General, and an independent assessment conducted by former Congressman Mineta.
The Committee is urged to provide the additional $50 million for the National Motor Carrier
Safety Grant program to undertake these improvements and increase safety on our Nation's roads
and highways.

Highway Safety

         The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee has provided $36 million less
than the President has requested for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
Operation and Research account. This funding reduction would limit important research
activities on advanced air bags, crash worthiness, and the enhanced testing proposed in the New
Car Assessment program to make better car safety information available to the public.

Amtrak

       The Subcommittee is commended for funding Amtrak at $571 million, the President's
requested level, and providing Amtrak with the flexibility to spend capital funds wisely by
adopting for Amtrak the same definition of capital as used by transit grantees.

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
                               Hex-Dump Conversion
Livability Programs

        The Administration is disappointed that the Subcommittee bill funds transit formula
grants at $212 million below the President's request and the Transportation Community and
Preservation Pilot program (TCSP) at $25 million, or 50 percent, below the request. The
earmarking of the TCSP program would hinder the goal of improving land use by not permitting
the development and identification of innovative new approaches. These livability programs are
important components of an Administration effort to provide communities with the tools and
resources they need to combat congestion and sprawl.

Job Access and Reverse Commute

        The Committee is urged to provide the additional $75 million requested for this program
because it is a critical component of the Administration's we1fare-to-work effort. This program
is significantly over-subscribed now. Demand is expected to increase as more communities
around the country begin to see how effective the program can be in helping individuals make a
successful transition from welfare to work.

Coast Guard

        The Administration is concerned about the Subcommittee's earmarks to continue
operations of the Long Island, New York, and Muskegon, Michigan, air facilities and to establish
an additional air facility at Waukegan, Illinois. The Coast Guard has concluded, based on
careful review, that none of these facilities is necessary to meet its search and rescue coverage
standards. By forcing the Coast Guard to spend nearly $9 million on these facilities, the
Subcommittee is effectively reducing funding for higher priority Coast Guard activities, such as
improving boat station readiness nationwide.

CAFE Standards

       The Administration urges the Committee to drop the prohibition of technical work on the
corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. This provision would compromise
important information that directly influences the Nation's environment and safety.

       We look forward to working with the Committee to address our mutual concerns.

                                            Sincerely,




                                            Jacob J. Lew

PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON MOVIE RATINGS ENFORCEMENT
THE ROOSEVELT ROOM
June 8, 1999

Now, I hope it wonO,t confuse anybody when I say that I just met with
representatives of NATO and we talked about the movies.

IO,m referring, of course, to a somewhat different O&NAT008 than usual-D) this
time, IO,m talking about the National Association of Theatre Owners. We
did have a very good discussion.  I spoke with NATO President Bill
Kartozian and his colleagues about the ways creative and committed people
are working together to prevent youth violence, and the ways the theatre
industry in particular is stepping up to its responsibility.

        It.was not even two months ago that the tragedy at Columbine High
School seared itself into our national consciousness. But ever since that
day we have, I think, moved surely and steadily toward the kind of future
we want for our country.  People from all walks of life are coming
together in a national grassroots campaign to prevent youth violence and
to give our young people the safe childhoods they deserve.

        We all know that parents are the first and most important
influence on a child. But we also know that the demands on parents are
increasing. As more and more parents work outside the home, they have
less and less time for their children.  Parents in the average family now
have 22 fewer hours each week to spend at home than parents did a

.    ..
generatlon ago.

        Since my first days as President we have worked hard to help
parents balance home and work. One of the ways weO,ve done that is by
giving parents better tools to make immediate but informed judgments 0)
about the shows their kids watch, the music they hear, and the video games
they play. We have worked hard to give parents new tools like the V-Chip,
which, by the end of next month, will be in every new television set sold
in America, and will help parents block violent programming from their
living rooms. WeO,ve also made progress on parental screening for the
Internet and ratings for Internet game sites.

        But for ratings systems to work, the ratings must be accurate; and
they must not be undercut by the industries that apply them. That is why,
last week, I asked the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission to study the extent to which the video game, music and movie
industries market violence to children 0) and whether those industries are
abiding by their own voluntary systems of regulation. Children must not
be targets in the marketing of violence.

For ratings systems to work, they must also be enforced. Not just by
watchful parents, but by retailers at the point of sale, and by theatre
owners at the mUltiplex. Still, too often, children are making it past
the ticket counter 0) underage, unescorted, and unquestioned. And too
often, people have chosen to look away rather than turn these children
away.

But today, I am pleased to announce that a powerful group has agreed to
draw the line at the theatre doors.  By checking IDs for O&R08-rated movies,
theatre owners will now make the O&R08 rating mean what it is supposed to
mean: O&Restricted.08 No one under 17 admitted without a parent or
guardian. No exceptions. No excuses.

Last week, when I challenged theatre owners to step up to their
responsibility,I could only have hoped they would respond so quickly or
resoundingly.  I want to applaud Bill Kartozian and his organization.  I
also want to thank Senators [Hatch and Leahy] for the work they have done
on this issue.

[As I have said, there are others who must step up to their responsibility
0) for the sake and the safety of our children.  This week, the House
Judiciary Committee will take up important legislation, already passed by
the Senate, to help prevent youth violence. This includes common-sense
measures that close the deadly gun-show loophole; require that safety
locks be sold with every handgun; ban the importation of large-capacity
ammunition clips; and ban violent juveniles from owning guns as adults.]

[I strongly urge the House not to riddle this legislation with loopholes.
They should act to pass it into law 0) and should act quickly. There is no
call or excuse for delay.  Every day of delay is another day for the NRA
to muscle Members of Congress into killing a good bill.   In recent days,
the NRA has fought to defy the growing consensus for common-sense gun
laws, and to defend the indefensible idea that criminals should be able to
buy guns at gun shows, no questions asked. The gun lobby is also trying
to muzzle gun representatives who came here a month ago and supported our
proposals.  Let me be clear:   those representatives of the gun industry
took a stand for what is right. They should be singled out for praise,
not targeted for retribution.]

I strongly hope the Congress will resist the pressure tactics of the gun

  .   ,.
lobby and step up to its responsibility.  In our great national effort to
prevent youth violence, none of us can stand aside, and none of us should
stand in the way.  Our national campaign is gathering members and gaining
momentum.  I think todayO,s commitment by the theatre owners demonstrates
that plainly. And in the weeks and months ahead, I believe we will
continue to move forward as one nation, striving together to build a
better future for all our children. Thank you.
