TEXT:
I will do the weekly item you asked for on service and race.   FYI,
attached is what John Gomperts/the Corporation are thinking so far about a
specific proposal for the President to serve on MLK Day. If we hate it,
we should let them know asap, but it sounds pretty good to me.   I will
include this idea in the weekly as a possibility unless you would rather I
didn't.

(FYI, I happened to get a copy of Harris Wofford's memo to the President
on the race town hall.  I understand you have a copy.   He also attached
the US News/Steve Waldman column that caught your eye.)



It would be a literacy-oriented project, likely connected with DC Reads
and the
work-study stuff that is going on,with the DC area colleges. We are
scheming
on a project in which K-3 students would be invited with their parents
and/or tutors.
Along with the people who are serving, the kids would build (more like put
together)
and then decorate a small bookshelf. The kids would then be able to take
the
bookcase home with them. And they would receive 5 - 10 books to start
their collection.
In addition, there will be reading stations and possibly other activities.

We have great partners such as First Book and the United Way and other
organizations . . The project will involve AmeriCorps, seniors,
service-learning and work-study -- a real streams of service kind of deal.

We are looking at locations, and looking specifically for a location that
would be suitable for the President and/or other White House principals.

We think the event can be very visual and also be right on message,
bringing
together a variety of intiatives of the president. We very much want the
President, and other principals to participate.

If you (or other folks) have an immediate negative reaction to this
proposal,
let me know. Our top goal is to have the President participate and we can
be
flexible and creative in coming up with the right project.
