TEXT:
Here's what Scott Fleming learned since our meeting yesterday:

l.  Kennedy's goal is to draft an amendment that he can use to "get back"
the women Dem's who voted with Hutchinson the last time, and then go with
them to Hutchinson to work out a deal (Scott and I think this is a very
unlikely scenario). While Kennedy's education staff (Donica Petrovich)
says that Kennedy feels strongly about this, it appears that he is mainly
being moved by the women's groups.  Donica admitted that she is having a
hard time getting the women Dem's very interested in this issue.

2.  Patty Murray's staff (Murray voted and worked against Hutchinson the
last time) also reports that there is little interest among women Dem's on
this amendment.  And while he confirmed Murray's opposion, she doesn't
feel that strongly about this either.

3. In   short, as we suspected yesterday,the women's groups are the big
issue   heie. In all liklihood, if they weren't pushing this one, there
would   not be much opposition among Dems.  So, a meeting with them still
seems   like a necessary step. Any word from Podesta on this issue?

4.  In addition, I continue   to think it might be helpful if Kennedy, the
female Dems and Dems on the   Ed and Labor committee had good information on
the NYC school. This won't    directly help with the women's groups, but may
give the Dems some addition   comfort if they decide to part ways with them
on this issue.
