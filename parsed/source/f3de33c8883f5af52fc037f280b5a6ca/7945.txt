BR/EK:

Cynthia told me that Daschle's folks were working on a secondary amendment
to Coverdell, and it occurred to me that we should push to get ONDCP
authorized in that amendment.  Biden and Hatch have worked out compromise
language on this that we can live with, and it could potentially give
Daschle a little moral high ground w/his secondary -- that is, if the R's
are serious about fighting drugs, toughening up our border attack,
submitting strategies, etc., how can they not take the first essential
step of including bipartisan language to authorize the office charged
w/leading that effort?

Just a thought ... jc3
