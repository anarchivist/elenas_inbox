     I am faxing the following documents:

     1.   Memo to the President
     2.   Cabinet contacts' numbers
     3.   WH working group contacts' -numbers
     4.   WH outreach list for the race initiative
     5.   Draft of Cabinet briefing agenda
     6.   Website memo

     Per our discussion (Rob and me) on the phone reo the Cabinet briefing,
     here are a few details.  First of all, a Cabinet briefing is simply a
     meeting held by Erskine in which staff literally brief the Cabinet on
     various priority issues. The race initiative· will be one of three (see
     agenda).  Sylvia recommends that the race initiative cover the following
     four areas:

     1) policy process (provided by Elena Kagan);
     2) agency best practices (we will have agency memos on Monday) ;
.·
     3) dialogue (how to pursue dialogue within and without agencies)
     4) other ideas (ie host dinners with academics, mayors, others for
     outreach / ideas)

     As we discussed, please feel free to call me this weekend. Also, know
     that Cabinet Affairs, Elena and I will be here to work with you next week
     to make this a fruitful discussion and briefing.
