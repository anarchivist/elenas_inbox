TEXT:
Maximum Leaders:

Staff Secretary is trying to clear a letter from POTUS to include at the
front of the Drug Strategy.  I've edited it some, per Rahm, and don't
think you need to worry about it (EK: I cc'd my edits to you).  However,
OMB is trying add a line about the need to enact tobacco legislation, and
I want to make sure that one or both of you are okay w/that.

Jose'
