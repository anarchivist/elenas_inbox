                             Questions and Answers on Health Care
                                        January 20, 1998




     Q.   How do you respond to critics of the Medicare buy-in proposal who charge that it is
          not and cannot be self-financing?

     A:   We simply do not believe they understand the policy.

          First of all, the President's proposal explicitly would direct the Medicare actuary to
          set premiums at levels necessary to pay for the cost of this program. Unlike any
          other previous changes to the Medicare program, this policy asks the people
          benefiting to pay for the costs associated with this coverage. Each year, the actuary
          would be required to adjust those premiums to reflect actual experience to ensure
          that they are sufficient to offset costs. [This is the same career actuary whose
          projections about the financial status of Medicare are relied upon by Medicare's
          Trustees, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have full confidence that his
          estimates are sound.)

          Second, from the beginning, we have acknowledged --and paid for -- any up-front
          costs associated with this proposal. The day the President announced the proposal
          we laid out the $2 billion cost that was associated with this proposal. We also
          committed to completely offset these costs through a package of fraud, waste and
          abuse initiatives that will be included in the President's budget proposal.

          Follow Up:    If this is self-financed, why is there any cost associated with this
                        proposal?

          A.            To ensure that the premium is affordable, we designed the 62-65
                        buy-in proposal so that there were two premium payments. Since the
                        second premium is not paid until age 65, there is a short-term "loan"
                        to participants to cover this cost. It is paid back, with interest, by the
                        participants and the temporary cost is completely offset by anti-fraud,
                        waste and abuse savings.

                        BACKGROUND: The first premium payment, about $300, reflects
                        the average cost of this age group and would be paid monthly before
                        participants turn 65. The second premium, about $15 per month per
                        year for each year participants enrolled in Medicare before age 65,
                        would be paid at the time of Medicare eligibility (at age 65). This
                        amount offsets the additional costs resulting from the fact that
                        participants are expected to be sicker than average.

                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
