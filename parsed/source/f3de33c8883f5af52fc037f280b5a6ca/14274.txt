TEXT:
So far, we have not heard anything from any intern applicants from Chicago. Do
you have a contact there in the placement office who can forward some resumes to
us? I think that we are on their regular list of summer intern programs. Maybe
they are behind since they start so much later than most schools? Thanks.
