TEXT:
How are we for Friday's event to add the tobacco message at the top of
girls nation? do you need another day or so to decide?

should leg affairs go ahead and invite for this event regardless of what
we are doing? i just don't want people who are against us on tobacco
going to. the stake out/press and ripping us afterwards because they were
mad he topped off the event with a tobacco message.

Please advise, thanks.
