TEXT:
Attached is a comprehensive table on abortion provisions in appropriations
language that will require policy decisions in order to print the FY 2000
Budget Appendix.  Traditionally, the Budget shows the prior year's (i.e.,
FY 1999 enacted) appropriations language, brackets language proposed for
deletion, and italicizes any new or revised language.  Note that there is
an overlap with the abortion items in the L/HHS General Provisions tracker
on health related issues on which you are currently being consulted.

Due to the FY 2000 Budget print schedule, we are requesting your


views/comments on these provisions by cob, January 7th. Please let me
know by then whether or not you agree with the recommendations in the
attached file or if you think we need to meet on any of these
provisions.

please note:   the file is a legal size document.
