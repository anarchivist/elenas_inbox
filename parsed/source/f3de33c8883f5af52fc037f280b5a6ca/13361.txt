TEXT:
Judy and I talked to basically everyone at the meeting not otherwise on the call
list after they received the letter. The reaction was the same as it was at the
meeting. They generally were happy with Kate's quote in today's New York Times
and indicated that while they will continue to be supportive of the
Administration, that is not to give us leeway to underestimate their
frustration.  They feel that the letter undermined their efforts and
unnecessarily exposes the Administration. They thanked us profusely for being
brought in. They also requested 1) a Presidential meeting on choice generally,
and 2) that the President meet with women who have had the procedure.
Again, we would appreciate it if you could e-mail us with the specific results
of your calls, and cc Holly (thanks to those of you that already have). Once
Betsy tells us about her calls, we'll e-mail you with everything.
Thanks,
Judy and Ashley
