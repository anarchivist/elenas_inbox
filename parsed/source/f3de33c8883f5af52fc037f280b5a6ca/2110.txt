       Agreement provides $34 billion over 5 years for new initiatives, including:

                      $14 billion for restoring medical and disability benefits to legal

       at least 2007

                      and PSOs and new preventive care benefits, including annual
                      mammograms without co-payments, diabetes self-management, and
                      colorectal screen ings

                      Reforms outdated payment methodology for home health, skilled nursing
                      facilities, outpatient departillents, and HMOs

                      Phases in, over time, cost of home health care into Part B premium with

       manage their Medicaid programs.
