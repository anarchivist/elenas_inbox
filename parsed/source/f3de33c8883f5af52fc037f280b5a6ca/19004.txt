Regulation of Controlled Substances and Impact on Terminally Ill_ Last April, you signed
the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act (ASFRA), which prohibited federal funds or health
facilities to be used to further assisted suicide. The DEA desires to formally declare that
"delivering, dispensing or prescribing a controlled substance with the intent of assisting a suicide
would not be under any current definition a legitimate medical purpose." Although this position
may appear to be generally consistent with ASFRA and your historic policy on this issue, the
Justice Department has concluded that the DEA's desired declaration cannot be sustained by
current Federal statute. The Department apparently believes that the funding prohibitions do not
extend to DEA's regulatory responsibility over the administration of controlled substances.
Because Congressman Hyde and Senator Hatch are aware that the Justice Department appears to
be about to release their formal position on the DEA position, they are preparing legislation to
empower DEA to make its declaration.

While we might want to seriously consider supporting or advocating such legislation ourselves,
we have concerns about how such legislation could be drafted and what type of negative impact
it might have on the legitimate use of controlled substances by physicians. In fact, although the
Catholic Health Association (CHA) strongly supports our historic position on assisted suicide
and the DEA declaration (as long as it is implemented with great sensitivity), they are extremely
nervous about a new statute because of their fear that new attention to this issue will further
inhibit physicians from the appropriate use of pain killers for the terminally ill. (The Institute of
Medicine has recently concluded that physicians fearing legal sanctions are increasingly
apprehensive about prescribing these medications -- an outcome no one wants.) We will be
meeting with CHA representatives next week to determine how best to proceed, but for the
moment we urge caution in taking an immediate position on legislation until this process is
completed.

Medicare Buy-in Event. On Tuesday, you are scheduled to attend an event on the Hill with the
Democratic sponsors of your Medicare buy-in proposal as they unveil their legislation. There
has been increasing interest in this legislation following the positive CBO analysis. The Kaiser
Foundation is planning to release a report next week that underscores the difficulty many older
Americans have accessing health insurance. Kaiser has agreed to let us discuss some of their
key findings in this announcement. Featured prominent in this event will be Senator Moynihan,
the lead Democratic Senate sponsor of this legislation. It is important to note that three of the
five Democratic members of the Medicare Commission are co-sponsors of this legislation
(Rockefeller, Dingell, and McDermott), and we are still holding out some hope that Senator
Kerrey will endorse the bill. Senator Breaux will clearly not endorse it as he believes that
associating himself in any way with this legislation will only further confuse his position on this
issue.

Missouri Update. This week, the Department of Health and Human Services met with
Governor Carnahan's staff to discuss the status on the approval of their children's health
insurance proposal. This discussion follows Governor Carnahan's request to you and the Vice
President for a rapid response to their proposal and internal meetings held with HHS, DPC,
OMB, and Intergovernmental Affairs on how best to move forward on this issue. Missouri has
previously insisted on retaining a financing mechanism that HHS interpreted to be illegal. The
         state's more recent proposal is extremely encouraging in that it represents their implicit
         acknowledgment that its provider taxes are illegal. Of course, they would never explicitly say
         this and have made clear that this proposal should have no bearing on how the Federal
         government should enforce their past reliance on their provider taxes, The meeting with HCFA
         was a good first step, HCF A indicated that they need additional information to determine the
         legality of Missouri's current proposal. The state seemed appreciative that these discussions now
         seem to be moving at a quicker pace and agreed to provide the necessary information as soon as
         possible. However, these negotiations will continue to be quite delicate. We are advising all
         within the Administration to remain quiet until they have been resolved,
