TO:                   Stephanie Streett
                      Assistant to the President
                      Director of Presidential Scheduling

FROM:                 Bruce Reed
                      Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and
                      Director of the Domestic Policy Council

                      Thurgood Marshall Jr.
                      Assistant to the President and Secretary to the Cabinet

REQUEST:              Presidential Video for the Department of Education's
                      Second Charter Schools National Conference

PURPOSE:              To reinforce the President's themes of accountability and
                      public school choice that he emphasized during his State of
                      the Union address.

BACKGROUND:           The U.S. Department of Education is sponsoring the second
                      "Charter Schools National Conference: Strengthening
                      Networks and Student Achievement", March 15-17, 1999
                      in Denver, CO. This conference will focus on the needs of
                      public charter schools and will draw on expertise within the
                      field to provide assistance in numerous areas including:
                      start-up issues facing new charter schools, accountability,
                      high standards, finances and facilities, ensuring equity and
                      access for all students, and providing access to federal
                      funds along with guidance on federal rules and regulations.

                      Since 1994, when President Clinton called on states to
                      create charter school opportunities nationwide and
                      proposed a federal grant program to provide start-up funds,
                      34 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico
                      have passed charter school laws. When President Clinton
                      came to office there was only one charter school in the
                      nation. Approximately 1100 of these independent public
                      schools are now open, and the President has called for the
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


                             creation of 3000 charter schools by early in the next
                             century.

National                           Conference in November 1997.)

                      (approximately half the audience);
                             -state-level policymakers considering charter school laws;
                             -representatives from organizations that grant charters;

                             in applying for charters; and
