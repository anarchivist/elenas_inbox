TEXT:
We have reached a deal with Abraham on the H-1B bill.   The bill includes:

(1)  a $500 fee for each visa (including a fee for renewals); money to be
used by JTPA; minority scholarships; increased DOL enforcement.

(2)  a recruitment and a no lay-off attestation for H-1B dependent
employers (those with a workforce that is more than 15% H-1B; with an
additional carve-out from some small businesses)

(3) a three year increase in the visas (FY99 = 115,000; FY 2000      115,000;
FY 2001 = 107,500)

(4) changes the definition of the prevailing wage to include total
compensation

(5)  does not permit job shops to place H-1B workers with end-employers
who have just laid off a comparable U.S. worker.

(6) increases penalties for violations (up to 3-year debarment and $35,000)

What we lost on the last round:

(1) DOJ administers the process for receiving a complaint from an
individual that the employer failed to comply with the recruitment
attestation (we wanted DOL to administer)

(2) DOL enhanced enforcement authority is temporary -- sunsets with the
visa increase (we wanted it to be permanent)

Those are the highlights. You will see a draft of the SAP, plus a more
detailed description of the bill, in the morning. The bill is scheduled
to be the last thing that the House considers tomorrow.
