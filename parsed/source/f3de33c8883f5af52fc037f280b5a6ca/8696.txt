The Honorable John M. McHugh
Chairman
Subcommittee on the Postal Service
Committee on Government Reform and Oversight
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Chairman McHugh:

I am writing to express the AdministrationD,s support for H.R. 3725, a
bill that would apply the requirements of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act (OSH Act) to the U.S. Postal Service.  We hope that Congress
will give postal employees the full benefit of OSHAD,s expertise and
authority.

The U.S. Postal Service, with more than 20,000 facilities, comprises 30
percent of the Federal civilian workforce.  However,  Postal Service
workersD, injury and illness cases involving lost time represent about 42
percent of the GovernmentD,s lost time cases.  The total injury and
illness cases of the Postal Service constitute about 48 percent of the
entire GovernmentD,s claims.   Consequently, we welcome the additional
tools H.R 3725 would provide in our efforts to improve occupational safety
and health in the Postal Service.

The Department of Labor has expressed its concern during this and the
previous Congress that many Federal, State and local public employees are
not adequately protected under the OSH Act. The Federal Government should
be the model for providing employees workplaces that are safe and
healthy.  H.R. 3725 is an important step in improving the quality of
public sector workplaces, which civil servants and their families deserve.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the presentation of this report from the standpoint of the
AdministrationD,s program.

                                        Sincerely,




                    Alexis M. Herman
