MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                      GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:              Auto Choice


Overview:

        The purpose of the memorandum is to provide you information on auto-insurance
reform and reach closure on our position on the "Auto Choice" legislation introduced last April
by a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress. Over the last several months, an NEC-DPC
inter-agency working group has spent considerable time analyzing the Auto Choice proposal and
reviewing other auto-insurance reform options. It is the strong view of the working group that
the benefits of the Auto Choice proposal does not justify the costs.

        Although proponents of Auto Choice claim that it will reduce insurance premiums by
approximately $250 per year for the average driver, the working group found little evidence that
this proposal or any other no-fault insurance plan will lead to lower rates. In the three states
that currently mandate insurance companies to offer drivers choice between no-fault and
pre-existing insurance plans (New Jersey, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania), there was no evidence
that insurance rates fell When choice was implemented. In addition, our analysis suggests that
under Auto Choice, bad drivers will benefit more than good drivers.

Background:

       "No-fault" insurance plans allow policyholders to recover financial losses from their own
insurance companies, regardless offault, while restricting their right to sue.

        Under current state no-fault laws, motorists may sue for damages beyond what their
insurance company pays (i.e., economic damages above the policy limit imd non-economic
damages such as pain and suffering) only if the case meets certain conditions. These conditions,
known as a "threshold," relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms
(a descriptive or verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (amonetary threshold).
Some laws also include the days of disability incurred as a result of the accident. The academic
evidence shows that verbal thresholds can lower insurance premiums but that monetary
thresholds can actually lead to higher premiums because people have an incentive to exaggerate
their medical bills so that they can sue for additional damages.
                                                              !lex-Dump Conversion
Proposals:

        The working group has considered two options. The first is the Auto Choice legislation
introduced by Senators McConnell and Moynihan and Representative Armey. Under this
proposal, drivers in states that accept the new federal legislation have a choice between the
existing system in their state and a no-fault plan called 'personal protection insurance' (PPI). A
driver who chooses the PPI option gets first-party coverage for economic damages (mostly
medical and lost wages), without regard to fault. The driver can sue or be sued for economic
damages above policy limits, but cannot sue or be sued for non-economic damages ('pain and
suffering') except in cases involving drug or alcohol abuse. A driver who opts to stay in the
state's current tort system must purchase tort maintenance coverage (TMC) to cover accidents
with PPI drivers.

         Because of some of the problems associated with the Auto Choice proposal, CEA
developed an alternative proposal, which achieves the same ends -- lower premiums -- but at less
cost. This proposal would require insurance companies to offer premiums on a per-mile basis
for those drivers who opted for no-fault coverage. Per-mile premiums would be charged based
on an estimate of miles, with a rebate or surcharge issued every year after an odometer reading.
Odometers could be read at regular inspections or by firms under contract with insurance
companies. Insurance companies would compete in their per-mile premium, subject to current
regulations; premiums would vary with regio'n, driving record, type of car, and safety features,
much as premiums vary now. While CEA supports this proposal over Auto Choice, they agree
that the current political environment does not allow us to propose per-mile premiums. They
would like us, however, to work to facilitate the voluntary adoption of per-mile premiums by
states, insurance companies, and individuals.

Analysis:

          There are a number of problems with these proposals. Perhaps most important, neither
of the proposals guarantees that insurance companies will pass on savings to consumers. There
is little evidence that over the long-term consumers saved money in states that have implemented
no-fault systems compared to the period when no-fault was not mandated. In addition, it is not
clear why the Federal government should-enter into a field that traditionally has been the
responsibility of state governments,and which there seem to active, on-going efforts of state
innovation and experimentation. Such involvement might also appear to conflict with our
long-standing skepticism of other Federal tort reform efforts.

        the McConnell-Armey Auto Choice legislation has additional adverse consequences.
The PPJ plan initially will attract more bad drivers than good ones, because they will no longer
have to be covered for non-economic damages. As bad drivers enter the PPJ system, the
premiums of safe drivers maintaining their current coverage will increase because of the need to
cover losses incurred as a result of other drivers' fault. Then, as the premiums of drivers in the
non-PPJ system rise, more and more people will switch to PPJ, thus further raising premiums for
those left in the system -- the very safest drivers. The end result is the progressive penalization of

       As noted above, proponents of the Auto Choice legislation claim that premiums for the
average driver will be reduced by $250 per year. While it is unclear whether this benefit will
ever materialize, their estimates reflect the fact that motorists will no longer be covered for pain
and suffering, which accounts for about one-third of auto-insurance premium rates. Any
reduction in auto insurance premiums, though, would have the unintended consequence of
increasing the number of miles driven, which would lead to more accidents, highway deaths,
congestion, and environmental degradation.

        The Per-mile premium option addresses this problem, but we believe that we could not
sustain support for it. While we would argue that the average premium for drivers would fall
under CEA's proposal, opponents would counter that we are "taxing" each mile that
middle-income families drive. They would also argue that monitoring miles is an example of
"big government" intrusion into people's lives.

         Although Auto Choice has wide bipartisan support -- from Senator McConnell to Senator
Moynihan and from Grover Nyquist to Mike Dukakis -- consumer groups, auto safety groups,
environmentalists, and attorneys representing automobile accident victims will oppose this
legislation.


Recommendation:

       There is unanimous agreement among the NEC-DPC interagency working group --
including the Office of White House Counsel, the Office of the Vice President, CEA, OMB,
Transportation, and Treasury -- that you should oppose the McConnell-Armey Auto Choice bill.

        Assuming you agree, the remaining issue is when to announce your position. If we
announce our opposition now, we may encourage supporters to bring the legislation up so as to
to define their disagreement with us. By contrast, if we remain quiet, the legislation may die on
its own. We therefore believe that it would be best to hold off any statement on the bill for now.
If Auto Choice comes to the floor, you could oppose it in a speech or we could issue a Statement
of Administration Policy.


Decision:

       Oppose Auto Choice, But Do Not Announce Position Unless And Until Bill Comes To
       Floor (RECOMMENDED)
