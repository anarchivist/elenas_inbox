'l'hanks for sharing Scott's dI:a£t with me. He had e-mailed me this version
and an earlier one, but I took a quick look and decided not to weigh in. My
bad (old) attitude. But now I have an im roved (positive) attitude.
Probably from our talk.

1. This version is watered down from the earlier version. Reportedly,
that's because Rahm was very concerned that the earlier version had
controversial stuff in it that would bash cops. (Which we definitely don't
want to do.) The problem is, this version misses the point of these
roundtable discussions.

2. I've done these. Ogletree is a master. There's a formula for scripting
and producing these disccussions. It involves: pick a couple of tough
issues; understand the intellectual structure of the issue, so you know the
two or three contrasting perspectives/arguments; figure out which of your
discussants will articulate which viewpoints, and which hard questions to
ask them in order to "move" them towards each other; conceptualize the
common-ground type resolution or conclusion to which you want to lead the
discussion.



 3. The three issues (profiling, incarceration/sentencing, full/equal
 service) strike me as perfect. But they need to be fleshed out per point #2
 above. Ogletree can and should do this; would be good to fly him down to
 listen to you or Rahm or Jose Cerda discuss this stuff. But I suggest you
 rely on Maria (they are friends and huge mutual fans from college) and me
 to be straight with him about our political concerns/needs.

 4. Rahm, I suspect, is interested in emphasizing community policing and
 "solutions", not the controversy. This is not quite right. You have to
 explore the conflict to connect with people and draw them in; you can't
 just lay the prescriptions on them. You argue (constructively, honestly)
 about the problems, and then raise ideas like community policing as
 solutions. Lead people to the solution, don't push/lecture.

 5. Trust Ogletree's advice on participants. Don't you need articulate and
 thoughtful people. "Ordinary" folks don't do so well at this, frankly. You
 aren't looking for faux authenticity. You are looking for people who can
 advance the ball.

 Thanks for asking. Let me know if I can help with Ogletree. (I had a phone
 chat with him a cojple of weeks ago to encourage him to agree to do this.
 But I haven't spoken with him since.)
