                             Hatch blows away
                                  Humphrey's $6 billion
                                  'tobacco team'

                                  Conrad deFiebre / Star Tribune

                                  As the first hundreds of millions of
                                  Minnesota's $6.1 billion settlement
                                  from tobacco companies flow into
                                  state coffers, most of the state lawyers
                                  who helped engineer it under former
                                  Attorney General Hubert Humphrey
                                  III are looking for work.

                                  New Attorney General Mike Hatch,
                                  as part of a general housecleaning of
                                  the office's executive ranks, has
                                  removed four of the five lawyers on
                                  Humphrey's in-house "tobacco team,"
                                  and the fifth left on his own terms.

                                  Hatch said most of the tobacco
                                  litigation work is finished, and it is
                                  common for a new attorney general to
                                  hire his own key staff members.

                                  All of the more than 200 lawyers in
                                  the attorney general's office serve as
                                  political appointees with no guarantee
                                  of job security.

                                  Most of the tobacco lawyers,
                                  however, joined the office under
                                  Humphrey'S predecessor, Warren
                                  Spannaus, and had worked there for
                                  more than 16 years. In addition, said
                                  Eric Johnson, former executive
                                  assistant to Humphrey and a leader of
                                  the tobacco team, they comprised
                                  "the most talented lawyers in the
                                  office."

                                  "I think Hatch let the cream of the
                                  crop go," Johnson said Friday.

                                  It was no surprise that Johnson and
                                  Lee Sheehy, Humphrey'S chief deputy,
                                  left when Hatch took office Jan. 4. But


                    the departures of lower-ranking
                    lawyers Douglas Blanke, Tom pursell
                    and Scott Strand were unexpected.

                    "They have done an excellent job,"
                    Hatch said. "They're a great credit to
                    the state. But all good lawsuits come
                    to an end. It's basically a mop-up
                    stage."

                    He added, however: "The real
                    tobacco team was Mike Ciresi," a
                    reference to the private attorney
                    Humphrey engaged to do much of the
                    litigation. Ciresi's firm of Robins
                    Kaplan Miller & Ciresi will reap more
                    than $500 million in fees for its work
                    on the suit.

                    No such jackpot awaits Humphrey's
                    in-house tobacco team, although
                    Blanke and Pursell are expected to
                    work for the Minnesota Partnership
                    for Action Against Tobacco, the
                    private foundation for smoking
                    cessation and research that will collect
                    $202 million of the settlement. Strand,
                    Sheehy and Johnson are seeking other
                    employment.

                    Partisan politics apparently did not
                    influence the shakeup; both Hatch and
                    Humphrey are DFLers, although
                    Hatch for years has been an outcast
                    from the party he once chaired.

                    In all, Hatch said he has removed
                    about 15 of the office's 500 total
                    employees. Some won't be replaced,
                    in an effort to plug a budget gap left by
                    Republican former Gov. Arne
                    Carlson's veto of $1.1 million in
                    funding for the office, Hatch said.

                    Others are being replaced as Hatch
                    seeks to put his stamp on the office.
                    He has hired Minneapolis medical
                    malpractice lawyer Peter Krieser to
                    head the health-licensing section,
                    replacing Marcia Johnson. He also has
                    hired a new chief health-licensing
                    investigator.

                    The section prosecutes disciplinary
                    cases against physicians, dentists and
                    other health professionals. Hatch said
                    it needs new direction to dispose of
                    cases as old as seven years and to
                    meet the challenges of a changing
                    medical marketplace.

                         Because any doctor who admits to a
                         license sanction is effectively banished
                         from Minnesota managed-care
                         networks, Hatch said, "every case is
                         all-out war."

                         He said Krieser, a former Minnesota
                         trial lawyer of the year, has the
                         expertise to match wits with top
                         defense lawyers hired by doctors.
