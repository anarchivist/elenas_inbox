                      OVERVIEW
               IMPORTANCE OF MEDICARE


Medicare pays for health care for 39 million elderly and disabled Americans:
About 34 million elderly and 5 million people with disabilities receive Medicare.


Helps those who would otherwise be uninsured: Before Medicare, almost half
(44 percent) of the elderly were uninsured. Given the recent rapid rise of the
uninsured ages 55 to 65, this problem would inevitably be worse today.


Improves life expectancy, access to care and reduce poverty: Since 1965:

o
     Life expectancy of the elderly has increased by 20 percent (79 to 82 years)

o
     Access to care has increased by one-third (elderly seeing doctors: 68 to 90%)

o
     Poverty has declined by nearly two-thirds (29.0 to 10.5%)

                                                            Bum;o ov 1998 T pucm;1;0"3 PI;1tOpt   2


More beneficiaries: Enrollment in Medicare will climb when the baby boom
generation retires: from 39 million to 47 million in 2010, to 80 million by 2035.


Fewer workers: At the same time, the ratio of workers (who support Medicare)
to beneficiaries is expected to decline by over 40 percent by 2030. (3.6 workers
per beneficiary in 2010, declining to 2.3 in 2030)


Cost growth will rise: Medicare has recently reigned in cost growth.
However, it is expected to rise again as the effects of recent policy changes wear
off (from 3 percent per beneficiary for 98-0~ to 6 percent for 2003-10).

Trust Fund crisis: Medicare's Trust Fund (for institutional services) will
become insolvent in 2008 according to the 1998 Trustees' Report. Even though
the 1999 Report will likely show a better prognosis, Medicare will still run out of
funds about 20 years before Social Security does. With no changes, Medicare's
spending will outstrip its financing and produce a $1 trillion shortfall by 2020.

Inadequate benefits:     Medicare's benefits are not very generous. In
particular:

o
      No prescription drug coverage: Even though drugs are an increasingly
      important part of health care, Medicare does not pay for them. As a result,
      America's elderly pay the highest price for drugs -- either by buying them
      without discounts or by paying for expensive Medigap insurance.

o
      High beneficiary payments for hospital care: Today, Medicare
      beneficiaries pay a $768 deductible for hospital care, and $192 per day after
      two months.

o
      Cost sharing for preventive care: Requiring beneficiary payments for
      preventive services (e.g., screening mammography) can discourage use.

o
      Medigap insurance: Because of Medicare's sub-standard benefits, about
      one-third of beneficiaries buy expensive and inefficient Medigap coverage.

           MEDICARE'S FINANCING CRISIS

Options to address Medicare's long-term solvency: A wide range of ideas have
been considered to help solve Medicare's fiscal imbalance. These can be
categorized as:

o
    Reducing provider payments and increasing efficiency

o
    Restricting or reducing benefits

o
    Increasing beneficiary contributions to Medicare, and/ or

o
    Adding new revenue to Medicare

            INCREASING EFFICIENCY

Strong, fiscal discipline is always a goal for Medicare: Since 1992,
overpayments to health care providers have been reduced and payment systems
have been modernized. In addition, there has been great successes in reducing
fraud, waste and abuse. As a result, Medicare is now growing at a rate that is
below the private sector health spending.

However, impossibly low Medicare growth rates would be needed to extend
Medicare's life through provider payment reductions and efficiency alone:
Spending growth per beneficiary would have to be
constrained to 2.8 percent per year -- in every year -- ~aI Spending Growth Per Person:
                                                                   20Q0.2020

Restricting the benefits that Medicare covers is a second option: However:

o
    Medicare's benefits are already less generous than 4 out of 5 employers'
    health insurance plans.

o
    All experts agree -- Medicare's benefits should be expanded to include
    prescription drugs and improved cost sharing, not reduced.

Only removing major, critical services could keep Medicare solvent in the
long-run: Because Medicare already has a limited benefits package, limiting it
even more would probably not solve its long-term problems. Even removing
the following services would not be sufficient to get to 2020:

o
     All skilled nursing facility plus hospice spending

o
     All Part A home health spending

Making beneficiaries pay more: A third option for addressing Medicare's
long-term financing crisis is to have beneficiaries pay for more of the cost of care.

o
     Beneficiaries already pay for almost half of their health care costs: Because
     of its less generous benefits and higher cost sharing, Medicare only pays 52
     percent of the total health care costs of its beneficiaries.

o
     Although there are an increasing number of beneficiaries with higher
     income, nearly two-thirds of elderly households have income below
     $20,000.

Adding new financing to Medicare: The fourth and final option is adding
revenues to the program. In the past, this option has rarely been used by
Congress and the Administration to bolster the program's financial status.


Different -- and larger-- financing crisis: However, as virtually every
independent analyst has concluded (e.g., Reischauer, Aaron, Tyson, Altman), the
retirement of the baby boom generation makes this crisis different. The
demographics make it impossible to address the financing challenge solely
through provider payment cuts and efficiency gains.


Two choices: Raise taxes or dedicate part of the surplus to Medicare: The
amount of financing needed to pay for Medicare's shortfall -- even after
significant restructuring -- can only come from the surplus or a new tax increase.

Focused attention on Medicare: The year-long deliberations of the Medicare
Commission has helped highlight the problems facing the Medicare program.

The Breaux-Thomas proposal has advanced the debate. The plan has
recommended a number of ideas worth serious.consideration, including:

o
    Making Medicare's traditional plan more competitive: It recommends that
    the program use the same effective, competitive management tools that are
    used in the private sector.

o
    Simplifying Medicare's complicated, confusing and multiple deductible
    structure: It recommends creating a single, simple deductible. It also
    eliminates cost sharing for preventive services.                                             I

            SHORTCOMINGS OF THE
      BREAUX-THOMAS MEDICARE PROPOSAL

Does not address Medicare's long-term solvency: Because it includes no
financing options, the Breaux-Thomas proposal does not address long-term
solvency. The lack of financing makes the problem much larger to solve in the
future and shifts more of the burden to our nation's children.


Raises the age eligibility for Medicare: The most rapidly growing group of the
uninsured are between the ages of 55-65. Raising the eligibility age of Medicare
without a policy that assures that there will not be even more uninsured elderly
is simply the wrong thing to do.


Includes flawed upremium support" proposal: The Breaux-Thomas proposal
would raise premiums for traditional Medicare by 10 to 20 percent for most
beneficiaries, according to the independent Medicare actuary. Although the
proposal attempts to address this problem for beneficiaries with no private plan
options, those with limited or unattractive private options would be forced to

   President's commitment to develop a plan to strengthen Medicare:
   Neither the President nor his 4 appointees to the Commission could endorse all
   of aspects of the Breaux-Thomas proposal. However, the President is committed
   to working with Congress to develop and pass a plan this year to strengthen
   Medicare for the next century. To that end, he has instructed his advisors to
   develop a plan that conform to the principles that he outlined in January:

   o
       Making Medicare more efficient and competitive;

   o
       Maintaining and improving Medicare's guaranteed benefits; and

   o
       Assuring adequate financing by dedicating 15 percent of the surplus to
       Medicare.

   Providing private sector purchasing tools for traditional Medicare: Medicare
   should be allowed to use the same, effective practices that private health insurers
   use to constrain costs, including:

   o
        Competitive pricing for services like medical supplies;

   o
        Selectively contracting with lower-cost, high-quality providers; and

   o
        Paying one price for a specific conditions (e.g., diabetes or heart attacks)
        rather than on a service-by-service basis.


   Examining other policies to reduce overpayment and increase competition: The
   Administration will also examine specific options to reduce fraud and
   overpayment, extend effective payment policies, and make managed care
   payments more competitive.

        MEDICARE'S GUARANTEED BENEFITS


Ensuring that Medicare's guarantee is strong: Medicare protects some of our
most vulnerable citizens -- the elderly and people with disabilities -- from
excessive health care costs. Proposal to strengthen Medicare must not do so at
the expense of this guarantee.

Providing a long-overdue prescription drug benefit:

o
     Critical to modern medicine: Nearly all Medicare beneficiaries use
     prescription drugs, and their costs are over three times as high as that of
     other adults, and nearly 10 times that of children.

o
     Essential component of legislation to strengthen Medicare: Any proposal
     should provide prescription drug coverage that is available and affordable,
     regardless of where they live or whether they are in a managed care plan.

Simplifying and improving Medicare's cost sharing

Providing new financing by dedicating part of the surplus to Medicare: The
President's proposal would transfer 15 percent of the projected unified budget
surplus to the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund for the next 15 years.
 This amount would equal $686 billion over the period.

o
     Investing now prevents larger problem later. Even though the Medicare
     shortfall is projected to accumulate to over $1 trillion by 2020, the
     President's $686 billion investment can fill this hole because it is done now --
     allowing it to build interest and prevent borrowing with interest later.

 o
     One-time, fixed contribution: The plan does not create an unlimited tap
     on general revenue for Medicare. Instead, it invests a fixed proportion of
     the surplus -- in large part created by the baby boom generation -- in
     Medicare to pay for services for the temporary but overwhelming influx of
     retirees in the future.

 o
     Better option than raising taxes: Medicare's 2.9 percent payroll tax would
     have to be raised by 20 percent to get Medicare through 2020. It would be
