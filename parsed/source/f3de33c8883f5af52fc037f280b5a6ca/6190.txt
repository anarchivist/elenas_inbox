TEXT:
FYI. The recent revelations that tobacco companies marketed to kids may
be changing the mood on Capitol Hill, but it may not effect the American
publics views much-- they already thought the companies marketed to
kids-- back in March one pollster (Harris) asked: do you think some
tobacco companies marketing is aimed at kids?
80 yes
19 no

Also, the notion in the meeting yesterday that this is a slam dunk
political issue if we just get a bill out there ignores data showing how
effective the Republican answer was when they tried it (you shouldn't do
tobacco alone, you 'should crack down on drugs) .
