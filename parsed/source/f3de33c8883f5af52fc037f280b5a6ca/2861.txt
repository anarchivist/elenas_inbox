TEXT:
We just learned that a very bad sentence on minimum wage that was not in
the Shaw letter was added to the Archer SAP at the last minute:

"In addition, under this proposal, working welfare recipients will be
deprived of the protection of laws addressing employment discrimination,
unsafe workplaces,child labor, overtime, and family and medical leave."

We had clearly told OMB what we wanted it to say -- the first draft of the
Shaw letter had language like the above, and we complained.  Then both the
Shaw letter and earlier drafts of the Archer letter reflected our wishes.
According to Barry White, though, th~s was added at the last minute, he
thinks between Jack Lew and Martha Foley.  I guess this means we have to
insist on seeing these one last time before they go out the door.  You
guys would have to make this point to Jack Lew for it to really stick.

Barry is asking Jack Lew his opinion on whether this sentence should be
dropped from all future versions.  I assume we would want it dropped,
despite the awkwardness of having it appear and then disappear?
