  Democratic Unveil Patients' Bill of Rights. Today, the Democratic Leadership introduced
  their version of the patients' bill of rights in a ceremony attended by Labor Secretary Alexis
  Herman. Your letter to the Leadership, which indicated strong support for this bill without
. providing an all out endorsement, was extremely well received. This legislation includes every
  patient protection recommended by your Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and
  Quality. It builds on these recommendations and includes an enforcement provision that allows
  remedies achieved through the state courts. Because this provision would preempt ERISA, it is
  the most controversial aspect of the bill and has already attracted strong opposition from the
  employer community. This legislation also includes a compromise whistleblower protection
  that is acceptable tq the labor community and not serious objectionable to the hospital
  community. We helped draft this compromise provision, and Congressman Dingell and Senator
  Kennedy were extremely appreciative of our help in this regard.


 On Track to Cover One Million Children at Sixth Month Anniversary of the Children's
 Health Insurance Program. Wednesday marks the sixth month anniversary of the Children's
 Health Insurance Program. Donna Shalala, in an event with Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling, will
 announce the approval.ofNew York and Illinois children's health plans. With these two new
 approvals, eight states will have come into this new program and will provide health care
 coverage for one niillion children. At this event, we will also be releasing a NECIDPC report on
 the rapid implementation of this new program. The report illustrates that an additional 15 states
 have already submitted proposals to HHS to expand health care coverage and that virtually every
 other state has a process underway to submit a proposal.
