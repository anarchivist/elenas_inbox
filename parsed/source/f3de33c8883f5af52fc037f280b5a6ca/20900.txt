TEXT:
        Chris Jennings and I had a conference call with representatives of
the Catholic Hospital Association this morning. The Catholic Church has no
moral objection to a medical procedure that is necessary to save a woman's
life, even if, as a consequence, a pregnancy is terminated.
        As we discussed earlier, there is a reasonable basis for
concluding that Congress intended to require institutions covered by Title
IX to provide abortions under those circumstances. Consequently, it
appears that a regulation can be drafted that is consistent with
Congressional intent on this point and that does not create a conflict
with the teachings of the Catholic Church. I will convey this information
to DOJ and work with them on drafting language. Please let me know if you
have suggestions as to how we should proceed.
