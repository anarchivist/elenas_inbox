TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:
The Senate just voted in favor of the Abraham bill 78-20.  Both Kennedy
amendments (recruitment and no-layoff attestations) were defeated. A
manager's amendment that included a training provision that authorized
demonstration programs that sound like Regional Skills Alliances, funded
through Title IV of JTPA, was also accepted.
The House Judiciary Committee is marking up the Smith bill Wednesday
morning.  Our letter is in circulation and includes a recommended veto
from the Secretary of Labor if the bill's reforms are weakened or if the
bill is not modified to include a training provision.

Julie
