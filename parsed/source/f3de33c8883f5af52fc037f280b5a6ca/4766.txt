TEXT:
I just faxed you a negative story on the service summit from Sunday'S
Boston Globe.   It says there has been no surge in volunteering since
April, and the President has done little to make this high-profile since
the summit.   It also criticizes America's Promise, but the General comes
off well.

In the next few weeks Jonathan Alter will do a 6-month update that will be
~nfluential.  He has two pet ideas: the President should make a crusade
out of the 5 goals for kids (legacy stuff), and he should make 1/2 or all
work-study into community service, and let welfare recipients do today's
work-study jobs. He thinks we wimped out because college presidents
opposed this.  (On the first idea, the President scribbled in the margins
of memos right after the summit that he would like to do events organized
around the 5 goals.)

Steve Silverman and lowe you a 6-month strategy memo and will get it to
you shortly.   It might make sense for our offensive strategy to stress
AmeriCorps and note how it gets the most out of volunteers.  But not sure
what news to point to there -- reauthorization will still be held up over
approps, and it's not too exciting.
