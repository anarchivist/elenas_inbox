TEXT:
To let you know how the meeting ended ...
Debbie and I are going to draft an options memo to go to Carol Rasco and Bruce.
Basically the memo will list three options: the NOW Executive Order; a softer
Presidential Directive to the Secretary and Attorney General directing them to
provide states with guidance and technical assistance; and a letter from the
President to the states encouraging states to address domestic violence in the
context of welfare reform by, among other things, providing services to victims
of domestic violence to help them safely and effectively move from welfare to
work.
What is your opinion on all of this? Do you prefer one option over the other,
or none of the above? Are we proceeding corectly? Feedback is welcome and
encouraged.
Thanks.
