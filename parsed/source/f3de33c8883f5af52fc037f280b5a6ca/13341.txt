            This is the same file that I sent to some of you last
    night, but now it's in WP 5.2 format to be sure everyone can pick
    it up ok.  It contains both the decision memo we sent out to Leon
    around 7:30 pm and the one and a half page draft statement (which
    in this file is labelled "talking points" because it also
    contains two bracked notes at the end) .
            Last night, the materials went into the briefing book for
    the President and were also faxed out directly to Leon Panetta
    and Mike McCurry.
            Brian Johnson will work with the communications staff
    today to produce the final version of the statement that will be
    released to the press, if one is finally to be released. That
    decision on to whom and by whom the information would be released
    still had not been made late last night.
