TEXT:
1. We will insert ourselves into the hate crimes stuff. Thanks. Mary has
been talking to Socratedes (sp. !) about it.

2.   We should have a good background memo for you on the civil rights
legal agencies Thursday: it will include a summary of what they do, how
they do it, what has been said about the agencies,  and a
timetable/process for our meeting with them and when we expect stuff back
from them.

3.     We will get the Hopwood meeting together.   I'm still learning the
stuff.

Regards, Tom
