TEXT:
Jeanne (who now is one of the two primary Journal reporters covering the
white House) is writing for Monday and needs to talk to each of you
(actually either Bruce or Elena will do, but I'd like Bruce to do it if
possible) .

Basically the piece is how we're tending to substantive business while the
impeachment process is going on.  I think each of you knows the drill
how the President is involved, whether he's focused, anecdotes, etc.  I'm
sure she'll try to squeeze some policy out as well, which there is no need
to do here. Anyway, she could use a call today.   Can we do that?
