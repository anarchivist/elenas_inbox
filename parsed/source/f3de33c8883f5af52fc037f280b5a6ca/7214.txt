Republicans blast Clinton on AIDS needle exchange


            WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other
top Republicans Tuesday blasted President Clinton for endorsing
needle exchange programs to prevent AIDS among drug users, even
though Clinton will not allow federal funds for such programs.
            "What's a little heroin or cocaine among friends,"
Gingrich said sarcastically at a news conference in which he
lambasted Clinton on drugs and teen smoking. "There's no such
thing as a healthy heroin addict, " he said.
            " I am personally appalled, " said Tom Delay of Texas, the


third-ranking Republican in the House, saying that Clinton was
talking about teen smoking but basically --throwing in the
towel"  in fighting drug abuse.
            --He's trying to take away cigarettes and give them needles
to stick in their arms,"  said Delay.
            The Republicans said that if Clintop did not reverse
himself, they would push through legislation against needle
exchange programs.
            They cited several studies which said needle exchanges do·
not prevent AIDS.
            Proponents of exchange programs, however, cite other studies
that show they do work, and the American Medical Association and
many AIDS groups favor trying the needle swap programs. AIDS
activists were angry that Clinton kept the ban on federal
funding while endorsing the concept at the community level.
            Gingrich called for an --omnibus"  anti-drug bill, which
could include a section on teenage smoking. Leading public
health advocates generally favor dealing with the two issues
separately.
