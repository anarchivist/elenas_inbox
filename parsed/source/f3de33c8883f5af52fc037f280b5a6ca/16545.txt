    I note we are NOT inviting OMB, either program staff or counsel's
    office/Mac Reed.  I think we decided this was the best strategy since they
    are likely to be negative at first, and we are at a delicate point.       But
    I just wanted to make sure we are on the same wave length. I    P6/(b)(6)
