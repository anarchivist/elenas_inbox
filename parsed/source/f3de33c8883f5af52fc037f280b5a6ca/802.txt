TEXT:
Elena, we want to keep this meeting small as it will only deal with our
decisions regarding affirmative action procurement. We will be meeting
with Maxine Waters, Wade Henderson, Weldon Latham,  and Marcia
Greenberger.  Subsequent meetings will deal with the other affirmative
action issues, including those that Steve is involve with. Thanks.
