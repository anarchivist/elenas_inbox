                            PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                           REMARKS BEFORE GIRLS' NATION
                                  THE WHITE HOUSE
                                    JULY 17, 1998

        Acknowledgments: AG Reno; Sec. Shalala; My Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs,
Janet Murguia, who represented the great state of Kansas in the Girls' Nation Class of 1977.
Janet tells me that she was inspired to go into public service because of Girls Nation.

        Welcome to the White House. I hope you've had a good week in Washington. Later,I
will be attending the 35th reunion of my own Boys Nation class. It's difficult for me to believe
that so many years have passed since that summer. The people I met then -- from my fellow Boys
Nation senators to President Kennedy -- made me believe that anything was possible -- that by
staying involved in our communities and in our democracy, we could change the world.

        I believe this is true for you, too. You are living in a time of even greater possibility,
perhaps the most exciting in the history of America. Just think of all the revolutionary changes
that have taken place over the course of your short lifetimes: The Cold War, which cast a
shadow over your parents and older siblings' childhoods, has ended. Technology has advanced at
a breathtaking pace -- fundamentally altering the way we all live, work, and learn. A typical
laptop computer today has more computer power in it than the world's largest supercomputer did
in the year you were born.

       And so many of the barriers that kept women from making the most of their potential and
contributing their talents to our society have fallen away: Today, America's lawyers are 12 times
more likely to be women than in 1963 -- the summer I was Boys Nation Senator. Women-owned
businesses are growing faster than the national economy. Women are earning more college
degrees than men and outnumber them in graduate school. 41 % of my own administration
appointees -- beginning with Sec. Shalala and Atty. Gen. Reno -- are women, by far the highest
percentage of any Presidency. And I look forward to the day when I read in the paper that
America's new president has invited her own Girls Nation class for a reunion celebration at the
White House.
        We must take advantage of all these unprecedented opportunities and seize this wonderful
moment in history to strengthen America for the future. Today, I want to talk to you about our
shared responsibility to fight one of the greatest threats to the future of our young people -- the'
national epidemic in teen smoking. I want to talk about what my administration will do and
what you, as some of America's leading young people, can do to win this fight.
        Every day, 3,000 young people take up smoking. 1,000 of them will die early as a result.
 Today, millions of young people will never reach their greatest potential because of a deadly
addiction that could easily have been prevented.
        That is why we cannot rest until we have passed comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to
raise the price of cigarettes, give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco as a drug, stop

drives, and protect farmers and farming communities.
        For decades, the tobacco companies have sought to hide the truth about the dangers of
smoking and their own efforts to target children. Even as they publicly denied the addictiveness
of nicotine, they conducted secret research in their labs, devised secret marketing strategies in
their boardrooms to addict children to smoking for life. How do we know this? Because the
tobacco company executives and scientists left a paper trail of memos and reports detailing these
strategies and findings --- never thinking that they would see the light of public scrutiny.
         With the help of the courts, these documents are becoming public. The documents tell
us -- in the tobacco companies' own words -- how children and minorities became pawns in their
efforts to recruit new customers. There are memos admitting in plain English that "the base of
our business is the high school student." Memos saying that "creating a fad [in the 14-20 year
old] market can be a great bonanza" for the tobacco company. And even as industry
spokespeople insisted that young people were off-limits for advertising strategies, one company
document from 1984 recommended targeting "younger adult smokers" because they were the
only source of "replacement smokers" in the future.
       Let's agree on at least one thing: Children are not the future of our tobacco companies.
They are the future of America. And we must not let their future, or America's future go up in
smoke.
        These documents contain a treasure trove of information -- information that can be used
to save lives. Public health experts can design more effective anti-smoking strategies by
studying the marketing plans in the documents. Scientists can look to the documents for findings
that can aid their research into nicotine addiction and tobacco-related illnesses. And all
Americans can understand the role the tobacco industry has played in hooking our children to the
deadly habit of smoking.
       There are tens of millions ofpages of these documents. While some of them are already
posted on the Internet, most are stored in depositories all across the country -- and as far away as
England. They are not easy to find. That is why I am directing the Secretary of Health and
Human Services to report back to me within 90 days with a plan to make all these documents
more accessible to all Americans. The plan should include a strategy for indexing the
documents and for making that index, as well as the documents themselves, widely available to
the public through the Internet and other methods. The plan should also propose a strategy for a
broad and rigorous analysis of the information contained in these documents.
        I am also pleased to announce that the Attomey General will file a brief in support of the
State of Minnesota's efforts to make the tobacco industry's own, currently-existing,
computerized index to these documents available to the public.
        We must lift the tobacco industry'S veil of secrecy so that all Americans can know the
origins of our epidemic of teen smoking -- and the history of our national addiction to tobacco.
Armed with the facts, we can and will win our fight against this deadly epidemic.
        So I want you to know that this administration and so many of our nation's leaders are
working to make sure this -- and all the other challenges of our time, from global warming to
greater access to education to Social Security -- do not become the intractable problems of your

taking action today. Many of you are already very involved in your communities -- as mentors,
Big Sisters, math and reading tutors, Sunday School teachers -- it's one of the reasons you were
chosen for Girls' Nation. I encourage you to stay involved and get even more involved -- help
raise public awareness of the issues you care about, propose solutions to our challenges, lobby
your elected leaders and participate in o~r political process. Our democracy is only as strong as
our citizens.
         As you have seen firsthand during your week in here Washington -- this is a city of
monuments to America's greatest heroes. Washington. Jefferson. Lincoln. FDR. Very few
Americans will ever be able to match their accomplishments, to leave behind as many gifts for
generations to come. But every American has the same capacity to love this country, to believe
in, to take part, to serve our democracy as much as they did. I call on you to love, to believe, to
serve America. Have faith that you, too, can make this world a better place.
