H.R. 4194 DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS
BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana;           Lewis (R),
California)
        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationO,s views on H.R. 4194, the Departments of Veterans Affairs
and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. Your
consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result,
critical programs are not funded or are underfunded, in particular, key
Presidential priorities such as funding for National Service, Superfund,
and climate change.  Furthermore, the Administration is very concerned
that the Committee has included problematic language regarding the Kyoto
Protocol and other issues.  Finally, the Administration understands that
an amendment will be offered to include unacceptable provisions now
contained in H.R. 2, such as those relaxing income targeting.  If the bill
were presented to the President without responding to these concerns, the
President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
   took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work with the
Congress on mutually agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be
used to increase high-priority discretionary programs, including those
funded by this bill.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the Committee
bill. We look forward to working with the House to resolve these concerns
as the bill moves forward.

Corporation for National and Community Service

        The Administration strongly objects to the termination of the
Corporation for National and Community Service, one of the
Administration's top priorities.   Eliminating funding for the Corporation
would deny more than 49,000 Americans the opportunity to serve as
AmeriCorps members in projects such as America Reads, the Administration's
effort to raise student literacy through the use of tutors to supplement
the school day activities.   In addition, over one million students of all
ages would forego the chance to participate in service learning activities
in their schools and neighborhoods. The funding level in the Committee
bill for the Corporation for National and Community Service is
unacceptable.

Environmental Protection Agency

        The Administration has several major concerns with the
CommitteeO,s mark for the Environmental Protection Agency.  In particular,


the Administration strongly objects to the $593 million, or 28-percent,
reduction to the PresidentD,s request for Superfund, which would delay
cleanups at sites nationwide and needlessly jeopardize public health.   In
addition, the Administration opposes the $16 million, or 18-percent,
reduction to the request for brownfields funding as well as restrictive
bill language that would hamper achievement of brownfield cleanups by
preventing their use for removals, cleanups, and revolving loan funds.
The Administration urges the House to restore Superfund to the requested
level and to delete the restrictive brownfields language.

        The Administration strongly opposes the CommitteeD,s $106 million
reduction in EPA funding for the Climate Change Technology Initiative.
This high-priority program should be funded fully to cut energy usage,
save consumers money, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We will work
with the Congress to restore requested funding as the bill moves forward.

        The Administration strongly opposes bill and report language
relating to the Kyoto Protocol that applies to the EPA and the Council on
Environmental Quality. While the Administration could not and would not
implement the Protocol until it is ratifi~d, the bill language could be
interpreted broadly to prevent activities that limit greenhouse gases --
for example, through enhancing energy efficiency -- but that are
authorized under current law. The report language also inappropriately
purports to prevent the Executive Branch from engaging in educational and
outreach activities related to treaty negotiations and other aspects of
climate change. The Administration opposes this and other riders because
they inappropriately use the legislative process by denying the public and
Members of Congress the opportunity to examine and debate these proposals
openly.

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s providing full
funding for the PresidentD,s Clean Water Action Plan, which is designed to
prevent pollution run-off and protect public health. The Administration
urges the Committee to provide the full $50 million r~quest to help
improve water quality in Boston Harbor and prevent beach closings.

        The Administration is concerned with the large number of
unrequested, earmarked projects in the Committee mark for EPA,
particularly when the Committee has reduced several other high-priority
Administration initiatives, including right-to-know programs, Montreal
Protocol, GLOBE, and Mexican border wastewater treatment funding.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

        The Administration understands that an amendment will be offered
to add H.R. 2, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997,
to the bill. H.R. 2 includes unacceptable provisions.   For example, by
changing the income targeting at admission for public and Section 8
assisted housing, H.R. 2 would shift subsidies from the poorest families,
many of whom are working, to families with incomes sufficient to have
greater housing choices.   Such provisions would increase homelessness and
hardship at a time when record numbers of Americans cannot afford even
basic housing. The Administration supports reasonable measures to
encourage a range of incomes in public housing and thereby reduce
concentrations of poverty. The Administration can find no rationale,
however, for relaxing the income targeting of Section 8 subsidies that can
be used throughout a community. We must not allow those with the most
desperate housing needs to be left out in the name of housing reform.

        The Administration is concerned about the funding levels provided


for key programs of the Department of Housing and urban Development,
particularly for welfare-to-work housing vouchers and other programs, such
as the Community Empowerment Fund, that would expand job opportunities.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decision to fund
17,700 incremental "Welfare-to-Work" housing vouchers. The Administration
would strongly support an amendment to increase the number of
welfare-to-work housing vouchers to help more families get or keep a job.
Indeed, with millions of families needing to make the transition from
welfare to work, and in light of recent studies that show historically
high unmet housing needs among very low-income Americans, the
Administration believes it is critical for the Congress to fund the entire
50,000 welfare-to-work housing vouchers provided for in the President's
request. Welfare-to-work housing vouchers will support implementation of
welfare reform by assisting those welfare recipients who need housing
assistance to get or keep a job.

        The Administration also encourages the Congress to fund fully the
President's request for $400 million for an Economic Development
Initiative Community Empowerment Fund to generate jobs in distressed
communities. The Committee has cut the request by $350 million, providing
only $50 million, as a set-aside within the existing CDBG program.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decisions to fund a
number of programs at the levels requested, including the Partnership for
Advancing Technologies in Housing (PATH) initiative, and to renew all
expiring Section 8 contracts.    The Administration is encouraged that the
Committee has provided funding for half the President's request for
Regional Opportunity Counseling, a voluntary effort to expand the housing
and employment opportunities available to low-income families.   We urge
full funding of the President's request for this program. We are also
pleased by the CommitteeD,s decision to provide $80 million for the Office
of Lead Ha,zard Control, to reduce the risk of childhood lead poisoning and
other health hazards. The Administration encourages the Congress to fund
fully a number of other areas -- Homeless Assistance, Brownfields, and
Regional Connections--and to end the ninety-day delay in reissuing of
Section 8 certificates/vouchers on turnover.

        The Administration is very concerned that the Subcommittee has not
included language extending the repeal of one-for-one replacement for
public housing.  Without this language, the bipartisan goal of demolishing
100,000 of the worst public housing units by FY 2003 may not be achieved.

        The Administration is pleased with the Committee's decision to
support an audit-based enforcement initiative for the Fair Housing
Initiatives program. We urge the Congress to fund fully this critical
fair housing initiative to reduce the level of housing discrimination.

        The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the
Administration's proposal to reform HUD's single-family property
disposition program, which would produce substantial savings by improving
the efficiency of FHAD,s property disposition processes and would permit
the Committee to provide additional resources to critical Committee
programs.  Finally, the Administration understands that there will be an
effort to eliminate the provisions in the bill that increase the FHA loan
limit.  The Administration strongly opposes such an effort. The
Administration urges the Congress instead to provide greater homeownership
opportunities by increasing the FHA loan limit to the "conforming" limit.

Council on Environmental Quality



            The Administration appreciates the modest increase over the FY
   1998 level provided for the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).
   However, we strongly believe that in order to allow CEQ to carry out its
   environmental mission and reinvention efforts, the full requested level
   should be provided, and language prohibiting use of detailees should be
   deleted.

   Community Development Financial Institutions Fund

           The Administration strongly urges the Committee to fund the
   Community Development Financial Institutions Fund at the requested level.
   The CommitteeO,s decision to reduce the request by $45 million would
   severely reduce the FundO,s ability to leverage investments, loans, and
   financial services in the countryO,s most distressed commu
