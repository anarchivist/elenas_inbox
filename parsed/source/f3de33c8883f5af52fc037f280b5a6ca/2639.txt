TEXT:
The French put forth a cloning paragraph for the Summit of the Eight on
Friday. NEC has asked us to vet it and recommend any changes by Thursday
COB.    I will work with OSTP and HHS over the next two days to respond
and also to draft preliminary national legislative language.   The biotech
and pharmaceutical industries have expressed concern about legislation and
the Summit proposal; OSTP, NBAC's exec director and I are meeting with
industry this afternoon to get their input.  I'm pulling in VP's office as
well.   Given the industry's interest, other WH offices may get calls
so I'll keep you posted.
