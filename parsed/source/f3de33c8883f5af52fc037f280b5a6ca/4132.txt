TEXT:
Something .that might help strengthen the material you've got on the
education pillar might bhe the Department's strategic plan. The
conversation this morning seemed to be centered heavily on inputs (new
spending on x,y). The Results Act is forcing the agencies to be more
results-oriented and couching the legacy as a result, rather than an
input, may help in telling the story.
