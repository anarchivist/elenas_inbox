TEXT:
Mary had an idea for an event on heroin and the fashion industry:  in the
wake of the President blasting them on heroin-chic ads, the industry put
together a council to reform themselves, we thought we should publicize
their response. You guys kind of liked the idea.

Now there is a report coming out that will show heroin use is up.  Mary
sent the event idea to Rahm who liked it (dovetailing with the report) and
suggested DPC put together a scheduling request.

We're sending the memo over to Jose/Leanne for figuring out if this is a
good idea. Options include having the fashion/entertainment people come
to the WH to talk about reforming the images they use, a PSA campaign, etc.
