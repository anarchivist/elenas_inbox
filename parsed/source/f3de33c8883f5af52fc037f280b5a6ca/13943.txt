TEXT:
Jeremy Ben-Ami and Diana Fortuna are calling a Welfare Reform
Implementation meeting on Monday, August 19 at 2:00pm in OEOB 211.
You already were called about the meeting, but I wanted to tell
you a little more about it, in case the message wasn't clear.
Monday's meeting is a subgroup of the larger meeting that took
place last week (August 9). Jeremy actually referred to Monday's
meeting as an opportunity to roll-up-your sleeves and talk more
about what to do to get the. bill implemented, to discuss work
plans, etc. The meeting also includes reps from Agencies.
Please RSVP whichever way is easiest for you -- email or 65571.
Thanks.

David/Doug:      I spoke w/Doug today re: Elena being out of
                 town during this meeting.  He was trying to catch
                 you today to find out who might be the appropriate
                 person from your office.
Kris/Anne:       If one of you could come, that'd be great.
Barry/Richard:   Diana spoke w/Richard Green about this meeting.
                 She mentioned about five people would attend. Can
                 you or Richard let me in on who those 5 might be?

Thanks again.
