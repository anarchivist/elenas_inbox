TEXT:
It was suggested to me by Commerce that you might want to give the
agencies some guidance about what to say when they are asked on the
occasion of the release of the EO about how it will affect them.
Commerce's impression is that some agencies may say that it doesn't affect
them. This could detract from the message if not handled sensitively.
