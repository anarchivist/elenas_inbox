TEXT:
We are trying to prepare a POTUS statement to be released in response to a
Supreme Court decision expected this Thursday.  The case, Bragdon v.
Abbott, will determine whether persons with asymptomatic HIV are protected
by the ADA. The proposed POTUS statement assumes a negative decision,
although we obviously do not know the outcome.

I have worked on this draft with Richard Sorian of HHS and Rob Weiner of
WH Counsel.  I have also sent it to Eleanor Acheson's office at Justice
for their review.  Diana Fortuna suggested Bill Lann Lee's shop as well,
so I'll have it forwarded to them.

I got the following reply from Robert Damus (OMB): "Since this is not·an
order, it does not need to go through the OMB EO process.  I would think
you want to send it to the affected agencies, like Justice and.HHS, and
have some kind of circulation within the EOP, like White House Counsel,
and then give it to the Staff Secretary's Office. Either that or simply
ask the Staff Secretary's Office what process they want."

Can you please review the attached draft and provide me with comments by
the close of Wednesday? Thanks! If you would like additional information
on the case, please let me know.

Todd

Subject:         Re: Take Two

This is a redraft of Todd's proposed statement by POTUS in the event of an
adverse decision.   It assumes that there may be some ambiguity regarding
the impact of the decision. The statement may require some fill-in,
·
    . -,
           probably at the end of the first paragraph, when we actually get the
           decision:

           I sincerely hope that today's decision by the Supreme Court in Bragdon v.
           Abbott, will not weaken the protections offered by the landmark Americans
           with Disabilities Act. The ADA was enacted with strong bi-partisan
           support to protect disabled Americans from discrimination. The
           Administration filed a brief in this case arguing that people with HIV
           are disabled whether or not they are symptomatic, and that the protections
           offered by the ADA therefore apply.

           I want to assure all disabled Americans, including those living with HIV
           disease and AIDS, that this Administration is firmly committed to
           protecting them from discrimination.  I have asked the Secretary of Health
           and Human Services, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Office
           of National AIDS Policy to: (1) assess the implications of today's
           decision; (2) review other Federal anti-discrimination protections -- in
           such programs as Medicare, Medicaid, the Ryan White CARE Act, veteran's
           health care, and publicly assisted housing -- potentially available to
           people living with HIV; and (3) recommend ways to strengthen existing
           protections.

           I call again on Congress to join us in the effort to afford all
           Americans, including the disabled, equal access to health care, housing,
           and other essential services.
