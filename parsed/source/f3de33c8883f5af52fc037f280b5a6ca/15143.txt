TEXT:
The NGA has sent a letter requesting a POTUS meeting with the Me'dicaid
Task Force (Miller, Chiles, Dean, Leavitt, Voinivich, Thompson) for late
April or early May.  It is clear from 90nversations with Ray, Executive
Director of NGA, (who says he's calling Jack and Chris) and from the dems
that the purpose of the meeting is to make clear to the POTUS their
opposition to the per capita cap and to reiterate that they will not
support children's health inititatiye unless we drop the cap. Ray is
prettty worked up as are the dems. They say they've heard from committee
staffers that for us the cap and disproportionate share cuts are not
negotiable and must haves in the budget talks.

Any advice on a response?   The Govs plan to meet with the leadership on
the Hill as well. Even the dems are saying this is a huge fight for
them--and they are saying that our plan forces them to reduce benefits and
cuts kids off.
