 TEXT:
 HHS's report on the contingency fund is almost ready for prime time.   It's
 required by Congress and was due April 1. We've worked with HHS in an
 effort to strike a good balance between an informative report that doesn't
 excessively dodge the questions and risks in this area, and yet is not
 unduly alarming about those risks.  It should be issued in the next week
 or two.  Below are highlights in case you are interested.  If you see any
 problems, let me know in the next day or two.

 under current national economic projections, the contingency fund is
 adequate.  But any evaluation at this time is preliminary, since the
 economy is strong and TANF is just being implemented.   So we have ·to keep
 watching.
 The report does not make any recommendations, but simply list~ options for
 Congress to consider that we aren't endorsing at this time.
 Eight states actually qualified for contingency funds in FY97 (Alaska,
 Calif, DC, Hawaii, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, and Washington) .
 All of these states except New Mexico qualified based on the trigger that
 food stamp caseload had increased.   New Mexico qualified based on the
 other trigger, that unemployment increased. However, only 2 of the 8
 states actually requested contingency funds:   North Carolina is getting
 $15 million, while New Mexico is getting $21 million.    HHS assumes that
 the other states held back because they couldn't meet the 100% MOE test
 that contingency fund access requires.
 We project that $210 million of the $2 billion contingency fund will be
 spent under current economic conditions, while CBO projects $435 million.
 However, these estimates are national in scope, and do not consider the
 possibility of a regional downturn that is not reflected in nation-wide
 figures. The report notes that at the moment most states have a cushion
 of unobligated TANF funds because of the economy and caseload drops.
 The only unresolved issue in the report is how to portray what a recession
 would do to the contingency fund.   Levin specifically asked HHS to run a
 scenario on this.   HHS estimates that a recession like the one in the
 early 90's would trigger a demand for contingency funds of $6.7 billion,
 far exceeding the. $2 billion. HHS' s estimate doesn't make sense to us at
 this point, so we are still looking at it. We are concerned about just
 dropping that number into the report, so if it doesn't change I'll let you

         know.
         One frustration is that HHS has nothing to say about whether the 2
         triggers for the contingency fund (food stamp caseload and unemployment)
         are good, bad, or indifferent. To me, the fact that 8 states have
         qualified for funds during these stellar economic conditions must mean
         that the triggers are too easy, but HHS was terrible at analyzing this,
         and the report only says that it's too early to judge this question.
         The report examines state complaints that the contingency fund MOE is too
         high and that it isn't fair to exclude separate state programs from the
         contingency fund MOE.   (As you recall, a state must spend 100% of
         historical spending to access the contingency fund, while TANF requires
         only 75/80%. Also, separate state programs count toward the TANF MOE, but
         not toward contingency MOE. We like this feature very much because it
         discourages separate state programs.)   The report tiptoes through the
         option of letting states count separate state programs toward contingency
         fund MOE, but then points out all th'e pitfalls associated with doing so --
         higher costs, no apparent benefit, encouraging separate state programs.
         Finally, the report recounts how last year's adoption bill' cut $40 million
         from the contingency fund, and how the first few states to access the fund
         could get screwed out of any money as a result. We are now arg~ing about
         whether to say that we might want to look for a new source for the $40
         million because this isn't fair to those states.
