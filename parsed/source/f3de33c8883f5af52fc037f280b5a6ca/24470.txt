MEMORANDUM FOR SELECTED FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

FROM:       Kevin R. Jones
            Deputy Assistant Attorney General

            Lisalyn R. Jacobs
            Counsel

SUBJECT:     Implementation of the Welfare Reform Legislation;
            Designation of Community Programs Necessary for
            Protection of Life and Safety

Introduction

        This memorandum is a request for your immediate assistance


regarding provisions of the new welfare legislation which require
a definition of government-funded community programs, services or
assistance for which all aliens will continue to be eligible.
Comments (oral or written) are due to the Office of Policy
Development, U.S. Department of Justice no later than noon on
Wednesday, August 21, 1996.

     The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996, H.R. 3934, as passed by Congress,
contains a number of provisions'of this bill will take effect on
enactment, and we are advised that the President may sign the
bill as soon as Thursday, August 22.

Discussion of Relevant Provisions of the Bill

     Section 401 of Title I of H.R. 3734 provides a general rule
that an alien who is not a "qualified alien," as defined in
subsection 431, is not eligible for any "Federal public benefit"
-- which, in summary, means any rant, contract, loan,
professional license or commercial license provided by a federal
agency or by appropriated federal funds.   (Note: the term
"Federal public benefit" does not apply to benefits to which
lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens or work authorized
nonimmigrant aliens are entitles under a U.S. reciprocal treaty
agreement.)  Similarly, subsection 411 provides that
non-qualified aliens are also ineligible for state ad local
public benefits.  In addition, subsection 403 of the Act makes
aliens
D,
ineligible for specific means-tested federal benefit programs for
a five-year period after their admission to the United States.
D,

     These general rules of ineligibility, however, are subject
to several enumerated exceptions in certain circumstances for
Social Security and housing benefits.  The Act also provides
exception for all aliens in specific circumstances, including:
medical assistance for emergency medical conditions;  short-term
in-kind emergency disaster relief;  and public health assistance
for immunizations and communicable diseases.

     In addition, subsection 401 (b) (1) (D) provides a further
exception covering all aliens in limited circumstances as defined
by the Attorney General:

     Programs, services, or assistance (such as soup kitchens,
crisis counseling and intervention, and short-term shelter)
specified by the Attorney General, in the Attorney General's sole
and unreviewable discretion after consultation with appropriate
Federal agencies and departments, which (i) deliver in-kind
services at the community level, including through public or
private nonprofit agencies;  ii}  do not condition the provision
of assistance, the amount of assistance provided, or the cost of
assistance provided on the individual recipient's income or
resources; and (iii) are necessary for the protection of life or
safety.

     This provision relates to such activities that are funded by


federal agencies or through federal appropriations. Section 411
 (b) (4) of the legislation gives the Attorney General the same
authority to designate such activities that are funded by state
or local agencies or through state or local appropriations.
Under the statute, the programs over which the Attorney General
has "designation authority" must not be means-tested---that is,
they must be open to all individuals desiring to participate
without regard to income or resources.

Request for Assistance

     Although the Attorney General is responsible for designating
such programs, services and assistance which all aliens will be
eligible to receive,· other federal, state and local agencies have
the primary expertise regarding the nature and scope of such
programs that may exist at the community level.

     Accordingly, the Department of Justice is seeking
recommendations from all interested federal, state, and local
agencies regarding such programs, services or assistance within
their responsibilities or which are conducted through federal,
state or local grants, contracts or loans administered by them.
Obviously, the kinds of non-means-tested community services to be
included in this list should be as complete as possible to ensure
D,
that all individuals will continue to have asses to·such programs
which are necessary for the protection of life or safety.
D,

     Although the Justice Department will formally solicit the
advice of all relevant agencies before the Attorney General issue
of final directive, we would like to be able to identify as many
types of programs as possible in the initial directive which will
likely be issued on Thursday August 22, 1996.  Given the
immediacy of this issue, we are seeking agency recommendations by
tomorrow, Wednesday AUGUST 20, 1996.

     Please direct your comments and responses to Lisa Jacobs in
the Department's Office of Policy Development, telephone (202)
514-3824, fax (202) 514-5715.
