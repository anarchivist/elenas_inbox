Elena,
Any word from Bruce on this? As I mentioned to you, there are some NEC
staffers with a very keen interest in this issue and they will be bringing
it up with Gene at Monday's NEC staff meeting.  It would be helpful to
have some indication of where we stand on this.  Thanks,
                                        Mark
