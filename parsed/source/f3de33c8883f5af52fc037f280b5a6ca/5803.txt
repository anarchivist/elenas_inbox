TEXT:
No, #5 was the cost of doubling the Early Head Start set-aside from 5% of
total BA to lO% of total BA, while maintaining program growth for regular
head start.

It is my understanding that the policy decided on in the Director's office
was to double Early Head Start slots, from 40,000 slots (projected FY98
number) to 80,000 slots by 2002. These slots would count toward the goal
of l million by 2002. This policy will cost less than #5. We are still
estimating the cost of this policy.

Is it your understanding that DPC, NEC, and OMB have now agreed to #5 (in
the meeting in Frank's office)?

Subject:         Head Start Options: Cost of Doubling Early Head Start

Below are estimates of the cost of expanding Head Start to l million
children by 2002 under the tentative agreement policies ($l50 million for
both the quality set-aside and COLA in FY99 and out years) and HHS' request
(full COLA and quality set-aside every year). The numbers below also
"




    provide estimates for doubling the Early Head Start (EHS)  set-aside to 10
    percent by 2003 (because set-aside is a percentage of the total, the
    higher cost options increase the cost of the set-aside). All increments
    are shown as deltas from the FY98 level of $4,355 million.
