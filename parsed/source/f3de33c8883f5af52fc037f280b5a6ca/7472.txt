TEXT:
Riley is going to release a slightly revised version of the religion in
school guidelines the President announced three years ago.  He is planning
to release them either May 14 or May 21, and he will bring in a few
parents and educators who can talk about how helpful these guidelines have
been in clarifying what is constitutionally protected religious expression
in schools.

The Education Department has asked if the President or Vice President
would participate in this event; it could be held at the White House
either May 14 or May 21. This is particularly timely, because the House
may vote on a constitutional amendment on school prayer later in the
month. What do you think? I think the VP would likely do this if
President didn't.
