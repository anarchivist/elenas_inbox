 TEXT:
 Attached is an outline of our workplan with OPL and NEC on equal pay. Our
 goal is to have announcement prepared for April 3 (which is Equal Pay Day) .

 We want to try to come up with a package that contains the following
 elements:

 1.      Data Collection (also contained in Daschle bill): We have thought
 about amending the EEO-1 form to collect wage data every year, but also
 are exploring options for collecting this data every other year.

 2.      Enforcement. we are exploring a couple of options including:
 a)      Increase funding by $5 million to increase enforcement of the
 Equal Pay Act and       the Civil Rights Act for the EEOC.
         b)      Increase penalities for the Equal Pay Act like adding
 compensatory damages             (this is also in Daschle bill)
         c)      Non-retaliation provision to amend the Equal Pay Act to
 prohibit employers from         penalizing employees for sharing
 information about their salaries with coworker           (also in
 Daschle bill)
         d)      Other types of whistleblower provisions
         e)      Exploring creating an OSHA-type model where the
 government could do                      compliance checks at companies
 and give them a window of opportunity to                 correct any
 violations.   This definitely could not be done by April 3, because
                 there appears to be certain statutory hurdles -- it is still worth
 exploring, however.

 3.      Federal Government: We are reaching out to OPM to see what, if
 anything, we could     do in the federal workplace such as a directive.

 4.      Technical Assistance
         a)      10-step voluntary self-audit for businesses: DOL would put
 this up on the                  Internet, and businesses could rate themselves.
         b)      $2'million for technical assistance team at DOl to reach
 out to 1000 companies.                  The technical assistance would
 include analysis of hiring, promotion,
                         compensation and evaluation data to ensure
 fairness and consistency for            women at all levels within the company.

         a)         Early in the week:  Meet with the agencies (DOL, EEOC, and
