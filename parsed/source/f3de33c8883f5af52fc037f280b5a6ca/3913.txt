TEXT:
The following statement was in a story about Helms v. Lugar:

          Lugar said, however, that he favored a "very substantial tax on
the order of $1.50" per
          pack on cigarettes to discourage smoking and was in favor of the
Food and Drug
          Administration's having power to control tobacco and nicotine.

The story also noted that Lugar has scheduled hearings on the settlement
for Sept. 11 and 18.
