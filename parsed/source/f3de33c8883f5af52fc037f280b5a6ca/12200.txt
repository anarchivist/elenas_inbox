       ANALYSIS OF ED-FLEX BILL -- TARGETING AND ACCOUNTABILITY
                              PROVISIONS

Targeting Provisions in ED-Flex Proposed Bills

House and Senate Provisions: The House bill would permit waivers "to allow schools to
participate in part A of title Lif the percentage of children from low-income families in the
attendance area of such school or who actually attend such school is within 5 percentage points
of the lowest percentage of such children for any school in the local educational agency that
meets the requirements of section 1113 of the Act." The Senate bill expressly prohibits waivers
relating to "serving eligible school attendance areas in rank order under section 11l3(a)(3) of the
[ESEA]."

Analysis:

       Section 11l3(a)(3) of the ESEA currently states that if, in allocating Title I-Part A funds,
       there are insufficient funds to serve all eligible school attendance areas, an LEA must
       annually rank the eligible schools in which the concentration of children from low-income
       families exceeds 75 percent from highest to lowest according to the percentage of children
       from low-income families. Then the LEAs must serve eligible schools in rank order.

       Current ED-Flex authority is silent on granting waivers regarding Title I eligibility and
       ED has approved waivers of the rank-order requirements for eligibility in the past.

       The Senate provision explicitly prohibits any waivers of the Title I rank-order
       requirements. Title I eligibility must remain targeted on high poverty schools.

         The effect of the proposed House provision is to allow waivers to permit additional
       schools to be eligible for Title I funds if they are marginally below the necessary poverty
       level. Although this would make some additional schools eligible for Title I funds, and
       thus is not as targeted as the Senate provision or the actual Title I statute, it is acceptable
       because it is better than current law and still targets on high-poverty schools (they have to
       be within 5 of the lowest poverty level).

       Because current ED-Flex authority is silent on this issue, both of these new provisions are
       more restrictive than current law. The Senate version would forbid any waivers affecting
       Title I eligibility and the House version would at least minimize the damage a waiver
       could do to Title I targeting, keeping Title I funds focused on high-poverty schools.

Administration's Position: Support both of these provisions.Both of them target Title I funds on
high-poverty schools more directly than our current waiver authority.
                                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion




Accountability Provisions in ED-Flex Proposed Bills

House and Senate Provisions:

State Eligibility:   The House bill requires the State to have already "developed and
implemented content standards and interim assessments and made substantial progress ... toward
developing and implementing performance standards and final aligned assessments, and toward
having local educational agencies in the State produce [school performance] profiles."     The
House bill refers to disaggregation of data only by reference, not as an explicit requirement.
The Senate bill requires only "substantial progress ... toward developing and implementing the
standards and assessments, and toward having local educational agencies in the State produce the
profiles." The Senate bill would require the State to have implemented the requirements in
section l11l(b) of the ESEA relating to the disaggregation of data.

The House bill requires an eligible State to hold LEAs and schools accountable for meeting the
educational goals described in their local applications for a waiver.    The Senate bill requires
States to hold LEAs and schools accountable for meeting educational goals in the abstract and
"for engaging in the technical assistance and corrective actions consistent with section 1116 of the
[ESEA], for the local educational agencies and schools that do not make adequate yearly
progress."

Analysis: Both bills make eligibility turn on the extent of implementation of Title I
accountability systems, and both bills offer an alternative to States of either essentially complete or
partial implementation:

        Under the essentially complete option, the Senat~ version is somewhat stronger because it
        explicitly requires the State to have implemented the requirements in section l111(b)
        relating to the disaggregation of data whereas the House version does not specifically
        mention disaggregation of data, but does reference it.

        With respect to the partial implementation alternative, the House bill appears to be the
        more rigorous since it requires States to have implemented content standards and interim
        assessments and made substantial progress toward developing and implementing the next
        steps of performance standards, assessments and school performance profiles. The
        Senate version only requires substantial progress be made in all of these areas.

        With respect to holding LEAs and schools accountable for meeting educational goals, the
        House version is more rigorous in that it requires that the specific goals in the waiver
        application be met.

Overall, the House accountability provisions for State eligibility are stronger.
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


Administration's Position.We prefer the more rigorous requirements in the House version as
they apply to implementation of standards and assessments under Title I of the ESEA and for
holding LEAs and schools accountable for meeting educational goals.

State AppJjcation. The House bill requires the State's ED-Flex plan to include a "description of
specific educational objectives the State intends to meet under [the] plan" and a description of
how the State "will measure the progress of local educational agencies in meeting [those] specific
goals."       The Senate bill instead requires the State to include in its flexibility plan a description
of how the plan is "consistent with and will assist in implementing the State comprehensive
reform plan" and if a State doesn't have such a plan, "a description of how the educational
flexibility plan is coordinated with activities described in section llll(b) of the [ESEAl" The
Senate bill also requires a description of how the SEA will evaluate the performance of students
in LEAs and schools affected by waivers "consistent with the requirements of title I of the
[ESEAl"

Analysis:    Both bills have pretty rigorous application standards: .

        The Senate version requires the State applications to reference State comprehensive plans
        or Section llll(b) of ESEA (Title I standards and assessments).

       The House bill, but not the Senate, requires States to describe specific educational
       objectives in their applications. Although it does not make reference to the State
       comprehensive plan, the requirement that the applications specify the specific objectives
       does have merit in that it would facilitate monitoring and accountability by the State and
       others such as the Federal government and interest groups.

       The House version appears more focused on local requirements and specifically on
       progress. It requires States to measure local progress by using the local applicants'
       objectives, as defined by the section of the bill requiring local applicants to set specific and
       measurable goals for schools and groups of students affected by waivers. The Senate
       version requires States to evaluate the performance of local applicants and students
       affected by waivers in general, not defined by local applications.

Administration Position: We prefer the Senate version that requires the State applications to
reference State comprehensive plans and have made reference to that in our letter. [We prefer the
House version of the latter provision that requires a focus pn local progress rather than just on
performance, but we are silent on that in the letter. The House Majority Staff Offer indicates
that the House version will be the one supported.]

Renewal ofED Flex Status.   To determine whether a State's ED Flex status under the new law
should be extended, the House bill would require the Secretary to determine whether the SEA
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

has made "measurable" progress toward achieving the objectives described in the application and
whether the SEA can demonstrate that its LEAs and schools have made "measurable" progress in
achieving the results describe in the application. The Senate bill would require that the Secretary
review generally the progress (absent the word "measurable") of the SEA, I;.EA, or school
towards meeting the goals set in the applications.
Analysis: The House version is more rigorous and it requires measurable progress.

Administration Position.  We support the House version and want the words "measurable
progress" to remain in the provision.
