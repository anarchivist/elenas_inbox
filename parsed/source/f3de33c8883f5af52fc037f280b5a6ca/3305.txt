    TEXT:
    As the attached indicates, Treasury did not include language in Rubin's
    tax letter regarding graduate student tuition waivers, TlAA-CREFF, or the
    Cardin amendment. Apparantly Bob Shireman was talked out of our position
    by Treasury. Bob is gone until later this week, and I have not been able
    to find out what happened.

    We should bring this up at the 4:30 Education meeting, and see if anyone
    else knows what happened.

    Below are the edits Bob sent. Gotbaum talked to Treasury, a Treasury guy
    called Shireman, and according to what Bob and Leg. Reference told me, Bob
    agreed not to fight Treasury on its preference NOT to include most of the
    changes.   (I think Bob said that on Cardin, Treasury would try to work
    quietly to get it dropped.)   I'll fax you the final letter.

    Here are our suggestions for addressing the concerns that have been raised
    and other issues:

    2nd paragraph:   add "postsecondary" before "educational opportunities"
".


      Last paragraph on first page, first line:   add "part-time students and
      students" after "help"

      Just prior to the Child Credit section, add:

      We object to provisions in the House bill that· would impose new taxes on
      graduate student tuition waivers, would change the tax status of
      TlAA-CREF, and would provide a tax credit for particular types of
      "accredited" tutoring assistance.  [Need to check terminology in the bill] .
