Subject:         WtW Formula Grant approvals--update

At the 4 p.m. welfare meeting, DOL mentioned that they are close to
approving TN, KA, HI, KY (and possibly MN and DE). They're aiming to have
everything ready to go by Thursday, with announcement possible by Monday.
Secretary Herman is keynote speaker at the National Assoc for Private
Industry Council meeting on Monday and would probably announce their
unless VP want to do an announcement.  They are still checking on whether
GA is a possibility for 3/2.  If GA is not ready for 3/2, would VP still
want to use the other states for an announcement early next week?
