TEXT:
I'm hearing from tribes that they are very worried that the Administration
is not hanging in on the tobacco bill for them.  I've explained that I've
been told that the McCain bill will have them included, and there
undoubtedly will be a floor fight.   They are concerned that we will not
stand with them to keep them independent of state decisions.  Can anyone
help me?
