MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                      LYNHOGAN

SUBJECT:              Welfare Caseload Statistics


        We have been working with HHS to compile a series of estimates which you may find
useful as you talk about the challenges ahead in welfare reform. The numbers are daunting, but
not as impossible as you might think.


I. Caseload Reduction, 1993-96

        When you took office, there were 14.1 million people on welfare, including nearly 5
million adults. By October 1996 (the latest figures available), the case load had dropped to 11.9
million people, fewer than 4.3 million of them adults. The 2.25 million decline (a 16%
decrease) is the largest caseload drop in history.

      The decline is even more striking when you consider that the caseload did not peak until
March 1994, when it reached 14.4 million (5.1 million adults). The caseload dropped 18%
between March 1994 and October 1996.

        If these trends hold, the total decline from January 1993 to January 1997 should be more
than 2.5 million people and between 900,000 and 1 million adults.

        No studies have been done to determine how much of the recent caseload decline is due
to a good economy and how much to state welfare reforms. Historically, the food stamp
caseload has closely tracked the business cycle, but the welfare caseload has not. More than half
the welfare caseload has never worked; an economic downturn is not what landed them on
welfare. A CRS study of the surge in welfare rolls during the Bush years attributed most of the
increase to the rising number of births to never-married mothers, not the 1990 recession.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

       Over the last four years, the largest drops have come in states with the most aggressive
welfare reform experiments -- including 40% declines in Wisconsin and Indiana. The past four
years have been a time of unprecedented state experimentation in welfare reform, and all the
tough talk from Washington on down has probably had some behavioral impact as well. (The
caseload drop was sharpest during the three-month period around the signing of the welfare law,
even though no recipient was affected by the new law during that period.)

        Still, it would be a mistake to give welfare reform all the credit for caseload changes over
the past four years. Virtually every state with a vigorous statewide effort has cut caseload by a
quarter or more. But some states did little or nothing to reform their welfare systems, and others
experimented in only a few counties.

       Four states had caseload increases between January 1993 and October 1996: Alaska,
Hawaii, New Mexico, and most important, California, which has 20% of the national caseload.
In each state, a mix of factors is at work: None of them has done much statewide on welfare
reform, and each has experienced population growth. California was late to join the economic
recovery, and leads the nation in child-only cases -- U.S.-citizen children of illegal immigrants
who are eligible for welfare because they were born here.


II. Key Facts about the Caseload

        Family Size: The average size of a welfare family is 2.8 people. Moving 360,000 adults
off welfare will reduce the caseload by 1 million people.

        Able-Bodied Recipients: HHS estimates that 80-90% of adult welfare recipients are
capable of joining the workforce. The other 10-20% are considered unable to work because of
health, age, or severe mental or physical disabilities.


III. Meeting the New Work Requirements

         Under the new welfare law, every able-bodied adult is supposed to work within 2 years of
receiving benefits. (About 35% of current recipients have been on the rolls less than 2 years.)
It is up to the states whether to enforce that requirement. The only enforceable federal
requirements are the 5-year lifetime limit on federal benefits and the work participation rates.

        Time Limits: Every welfare recipient now has a 5-year lifetime clock, which begins
ticking when a state's new plan is certified complete, and stops every time the recipient goes off
welfare. States can exempt 20% of the caseload from the 5-year limit, and use state dollars to
exempt others if they choose. Most recipients will take longer than 5 years to reach the 5-year
limit, because all but the permanent underclass (about a quarter of recipients) cycle on and off the
caseload. Until we have a national time clock -- which was envisioned in our 1994 bill, but not


                                                 2
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion


included in the final law -- some recipients also may be able to circumvent the lifetime limit by
moving from state to state.

         Work Participation Rates: Under the new welfare law, states must have 25% of their
adult caseload in work activities in 1997, 30% in 1998,35% in 1999,40% in 2000, 45% in 2001,
and 50% in 2002 and beyond. But states get credit for people they move off welfare altogether
in the meantime. If a state's caseload has dropped since FY1995, the state's work participation
rate is reduced accordingly. Effective work rates for this year and beyond have already been
reduced 8% nationwide by recent declines in the caseload. (Many states have lowered their
caseloads and their effective work rates by twice that much. A few haven't lowered their
caseloads at all.)

       The following projections were calculated by HHS but are considered preliminary and are
under review. About a quarter of the adult caseload is exempt for a variety of reasons, primarily
the exemption for parents with children under one. By these estimates, states will be required to
put 1 million adults into work activities by the year 2000, and 1.1 million by the year 2002. That
number will be lower if caseload declines are greater than projected. (The current caseload is
already slightly smaller than the FY2000 projection.)

Work participation rate                                             40%             50%

Total number of adults required to work                             1 million       1.1 million
(Effective work rate multiplied by non-exempt caseload)


        Only a portion of the 1 million would be in subsidized work programs in the private or
public sector. States can count vocational education as "work" toward a fifth of its participation
requirement. Several states may raise their earnings disregards so that they can count more of
the working poor toward their participation rates.

       We will ask HHS to run these numbers on a state-by-state basis as well. By these

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


estimates, New York State, with more than 9% of the national caseload, will have to place
around 100,000 in work by the year 2000.


IV. Hiring Power in the U.S.

        There are 826,000 U.S. businesses with more than 20 employees.

       There are 135,119 congregations with more than 200 members, and 205,583
congregations with more than 100 members.

        There are 1.1 million nonprofit organizations (not including congregations).

        We will run these numbers on a state-by-state basis as well.


V. Miscellaneous Statistics

      State Plans: So far, 42 states have submitted their new state plans to HHS under the new
law. Of the 42, HHS has certified 35 complete (including New York).

        Work Supplementation: As of August 22,1996, when you signed the welfare law, 11
states had received waivers to modify work supplementation rules. Oregon and Missouri
pioneered this concept. Most of those waivers sought to combine AFDC and food stamp
benefits to subsidize jobs.

         Out-of-Wedlock Births: The birth rate for unmarried women dropped 4% in 1995, the
first decline in 19 years. The proportion of all births to unmarried mothers declined slightly to
32.0% in 1995, from 32.6% in 1994. Three years ago, Senator Moynihan predicted that the ratio
would rise to 40% or even 50% over the next decade.

         Teen Pregnancy: The teen birth rate has declined four years in a row by a total of 8%
between 1991 and 1995. Half a million teenagers 15-19 give birth every year. Moynihan wrote
an op-ed last month criticizing us for taking credit for reducing teen pregnancy when the
illegitimacy ratio for teenagers actually rose (from 70% in 1992 to 72% in 1995). But the teen
birth rate fell faster than the teen illegitimacy ratio went up, and the overall illegitimll.cy ratio has
stopped rising.

        Child Support: Child support collections increased 50%, from $8 billion in 1992 to $12
billion in 1996.

      Paternity Establishment: Paternity establishments have increased under the Clinton
Administration from 554,637 in 1993 to 903,000 in 1995.


                                                   4
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


       Poverty: The number of people in poverty dropped by 2.9 million between 1993 and
1995, after four straight years of increases.


VI. Other Questions

        Childless Adults: Most states do not provide welfare benefits for single, childless adults.
This population will be hit hard by the 3-month time limit on food stamps. Our budget would
restore their eligibility (unless they tum down a work slot), provide states with funds for 380,000
new work slots, and make childless adults eligible for our expanded Work Opportunities Tax
Credit, which gives employers a 50% credit on the first $10,000 in annual wages.

        Organizing CEOs: Eli Segal has drafted a strategic plan for a non-profit organization to
recruit businesses to hire people off welfare. He will send us a copy after his board approves it
next week. Eli will probably serve as president of the organization, with most of the CEOs you
met as a governing board.

         Organizing Non-Profits and Religious Organizations: We have spoken with Maria
Echaveste about the need for a full-time staffer in Public Liaison to organize religious
institutions, non-profits, and businesses to move people from welfare to work.
