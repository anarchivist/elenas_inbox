 Subject:         Replacing DiIulio

 Richard--
         John DiIulio couldn't reschedule his previbus committment to
 participate in an essay award ceremony at an inner-city elementary school
 where he is a volunteer teacher. .We are identifying some other
 possibilities.   As you know, James Q. Wilson already had a previous
 committment.

          One person who was suggested this morning is William Wilbanks,
 Professor at Florida International university, who wrote the book "The
 Myth of a Racist Justice System." Scott spoke to him this morning and
 like many in this field, his views do not easily fall into one camp or
 another.   For instance, he is against racial profiling.

         Another person who was suggested is Jared Taylor who wrote "Paved
 with Good Intentions: The Failure of Race Relations in Contemporary
 America." We have not pursued this person yet.

         Do you have any thoughts on either of these people?
                                                                  --Jacinta
