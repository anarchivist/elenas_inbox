TEXT:
Message Creation Date was at   3-JUN-1997 18:50:00

Shortly, you should receive a faxed copy of a draft letter for OMB Director
Raines' signature to transmit the "benefits for immigrants" proposals in the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement.   (Also attached for your information is the final
legislative language for these proposals.)   Please review the letter and


provide comments to me by 11 a.m. tomorrow (6/4/97).

If we do not receive comments from you by the deadline, we will advise the
Director that you have no objection.
