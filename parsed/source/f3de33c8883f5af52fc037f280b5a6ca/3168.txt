TEXT:
I wrote this down from their meeting yesterday.  These are the points that
were agreed to by consensus (including Heart, Cancer, AMA, the Campaign)
for inclusion in their "blueprint," which is their effort to set the right
public health agenda.  They will also have a second document, a "letter,"
that will be a side-by-side of their blueprint and the proposed settlement.

"First, and most important:  Failure to meet youth smoking reduction
targets must lead to severe, predictable sanctions that would serve as a
significant financial deterrent directly affecting shareholder value of
industry companies.

2. The tobacco industry should be required to meet increasingly stringent
youth tobacco consumption reduction targets every year, beginning with the
second year.

3.   No caps on any penalties that are related to meeting targets.

4. Will remain silent in blueprint on this matter because it is not a
public health question, but decided there should not be a rebate or
abatement provisions.

5.  There should be non-financial penalties (e.g., plain packaging)     for
missing youth reduction targets.

6.  Funds collected from penalties should be used to further reduce
consumption of tobacco products with youth as the first priority.

7.   Performance penalties should be assessed on a company by company basis.

8.  There should be some industry oversight apparatus to help insure
compliance with the youth reduction targets that would include review of
industry behavior and help insure appropriate incentives."
