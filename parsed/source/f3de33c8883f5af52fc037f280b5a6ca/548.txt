 TEXT:
 We have tentatively scheduled a conference call with HHS to brief the
 White
 House and OMB on their progress in responding to the President's EO on
 adoption
 and foster care for this Thursday at 5pm.

 Please call if you have a conflict and want to be on the call.       We will
 notify
 you with the conference call phone number.

 The final HHS adoption report is due Feb. 14, and we plan to schedule
 meetings


 for next week to have substantive discussions of the content of the report
 so
 that there will be a draft report by Feb. 1.
