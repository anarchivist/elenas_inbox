TEXT:
Elena,
Here's the text of a draft I put together for letters on Prop 211.   I'll also
fax it to you so you have a hardcopy.
Thanks,
Tracy
DRAFT
Thank you very much for writing to me about Proposition 211, the
California ballot initiative that would allow shareholders to sue
public companies, their executives, and advisors over unexpected
changes in stock value.
I opposed this provision because I believed it would have
increased the number of frivolous lawsuits, weakened California's
economy, and undermined individual investors and consumer
protection in the state.   I also disagreed with provisions that
prohibit limits on lawyers fees and which bar companies from
covering the cost of defending company executives and directors
charged with securities fraud, but allow the company to purchase
insurance to cover such expenses.   In addition, many of the
issues addressed by Proposition 211 are already regulated by
existing federal securities law.
While I understand your concerns about expanding the rights of
fraud victims, I believe the problems with Proposition 211
outweighed its benefits.
