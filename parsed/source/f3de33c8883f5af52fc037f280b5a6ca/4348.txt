                           A Brief History of Charter Schools

Defmition
Charter schools are public schools run by groups of teachers, parents or other community leaders
that operate with a contract -- or charter. Charters are granted by public groups, such as local
school boards or state boards of education. Each charter explains how the school will operate
and how well its students will perform. In many states, as long as the school meets the terms of
its charter it is freed from rules and regulations covering traditional public schools. However,
charter schools are held highly accountable, and if students in a charter school fail to perform at
levels described in their charter, or if the school breaks rules that have not been waived, it can be
closed. As public schools, charter schools are not allowed to charge tuition, they must be
non-sectarian, and they cannot be selective in their admissions.

Background
The concept of charter schools grew out of several other education reforms, including expanding
public school choice, increasing accountability, delegating control of education and
management decisions to schools, and increasing parent and community involvement in
schools. At the heart of the concept is an exchange. Charter schools receive increased
autonomy in exchange for performing under increased accountability. The charter school
movement grew out of a belief that carefully developed competition among existing public
schools and new kinds of schools could provide three things:
       1. a broader range of options for families within public education systems;
       2. new models of successful schools that traditional schools could replicate; and
       3. incentives for school districts to improve their other schools.

Growth
Minnesota became the first state to enact charter school legislation in 1991.The first charter
school opened in Minnesota in 1992. Since then, the charter reform concept has spread
rapidly. In January 1997, 428 charter schools were open, and in the beginning of the
1997-98 school year approximately 700 charter schools were operating. These numbers
are likely to grow rapidly over the next few years.

As of September, 1997, 29 states have enacted varying forms of charter school laws.
Federal legislation also provides the District of Columbia with a charter law and Puerto
Rico has enacted its own version of charter school legislation. [see chart below] The state
of Oregon has no specific charter law but does have authority in state law to establish
charter schools and has received a Federal grant.

The specific terms of states' charter legislation vary widely and reflect considerable
differences in
how the states view the charter school concept. In some states, charter school legislation
could be characterized as a relatively modest effort to facilitate modifications in the
relationship of existing individual schools to local school districts. On the other end of the
spectrum, charter legislation in other states provides opportunities for fundamentally
different schools, sponsored by groups such as state boards of education or public
universities, as well as local school boards.             Hex-Dump Conversion

Federal Role
The 1994 amendments to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act established a role
for the Federal government in the charter movement by authorizing funds for charter
school development and for a national study to assess the impact of charter schools. This
program is designed to address the most pressing challenge shown in surveys to be facing
charter schools: a lack of access to start-up funding. This programs also provides funds
(up to 10% of the total) for national activities to support the development of charter
schools, including a charter schools website, techriical assistance and infonnation to parents
and teachers about charter schools and research.
