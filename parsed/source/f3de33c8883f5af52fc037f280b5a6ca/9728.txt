TEXT:
If there is no deal on tobacco recoupment I don't want there to be blame
placed on us. My reports are that our opposition to a unrestricted deal
is being used to blame us for no deal.  I think we should now be
pro-active in indicating that we are willing to accept a deal with the
McCain menu and committing that to paper. A Bowles letter perhaps. I
recognize that pressure from Myers etc may make this difficult, but if we
can do it, it would improve our posture with the states looking to place
blame.

Chris, thanks for calling Charly back.
