TEXT:
They've proposed to add the following language to the conferee letter:

  "The Administration strongly supports the goal of providing educational
opportunities to enable enabling more welfare recipients to move from
welfare to work."

I plan to say no -- I assume you agree?

Here is how the whole paragraph would read.

       The Senate bill contains a provision amending the
       Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program
       (TANF).  It would expand the type and length of
       education programs that may be counted toward a
       State's "work activity" participation rate.   The
       provision would also extend the FY98 and FY99
       exclusion of teen parents from the cap on education
       programs that may be counted toward a State's "work
       activity" participation rate to FY2000 and beyond.
       The Administration strongly supports the goal of
       providing educational opportunities to
       enable enabling more welfare recipients to
       move from welfare to work. We look forward to working
       with conferees to ensur~ that the final legislation
       keeps the doors of college open to all Americans
       while still maintaining the welfare law's strong work
       requirements.
