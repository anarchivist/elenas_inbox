TEXT:
We're all set for MADD Board of Directors briefing Friday. Any interest
in dropping by to kick it off at 10:00 am?   Draft agenda below.

Re. Cloning    Leg Affairs, OSTP and I have started to meet with key Hill
staff. Given the likely course the debate would take if the bill moves,
we will need to think hard about whether to push for the bill's
consideration.   House Science majority doesn't expect to be able to move
the bill through committee without dropping sunset and expanding it to
cover some, if not all, embryo research. Morella's staff has asked us to
talk to Ehler's and try to work out an acceptable bill. But House
Commerce will have joint jurisdiction, and the expectation is that that
committee would tackle the embryo debate head on, and that the Republican
leadership would have the same agenda.   Bottom line, any bill coming out
of the House will have broad ban on embryo research -- something we don't
want to confront (as you know, Bond would push for the same result in the
Senate) .

Instead of pushing for passage, we may want to simply have Ehlers and/or
others (ideally a moderate dem) introduce a bill we can live with to put
down a marker, but not push for full consideration in House or Senate.
Hilley's up to speed; we'll keep you posted as we do a couple more
meetings this week.
