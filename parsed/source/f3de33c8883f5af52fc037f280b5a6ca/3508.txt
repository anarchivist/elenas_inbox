TEXT:
I heard that the House may offer to the Senate:

        1) Labor runs formula part of program; HHS gives competitive grants
        2) 90% formula, 10% competitive, but could increase to 15%
competitive if needed
                to keep Senate HHS-advocates happier
        3) No set-asides within competitive for rural or cities
        4) Lower small state minimum to .25% (which is good for cities)
        5) Senate performance bonus, which is bad for us.
        6) House provisions on Pennington
        7) Keep Amerasians, Cuban-Haitians, but not Kennedy
too-disabled-to naturalize or Medicaid 5 year ban exemption for kids

All around, not a bad deal for us.   We're not supposed to know this, so
don't let Republicans know we do.

Major arguments continue between the Senate and the House on FLSA; SSI
State Supplements; and future disabled legal Immigrants.
