TEXT:
I t is very likely that the issue of H-2A "reform" will come up again next
session (as you know, the Secretary of Labor is meeting with Graham and
Wyden the first week of December to discuss agricultural guestworkers) .
The goal of this afternoon's meeting is to establish our strategy for
moving forward.   Two key questions:

1. Process vis-a-vis the Hill -- convene bipartisan mtgs (consistent
with DOL's commitment to Coverdell, but unlikely to produce anything) vs.
outreach to selected Members individually -- on both sides of the issue
(though, perhaps, not the aisle) -- who are looking for a reasonable
compromise (Berman; Graham; Kennedy).

2.  Internal process -- should we continue to move forward on developing
our internal recommendations reo both legislative and administration
options (including pilot proposals).  Example: AgNet?
