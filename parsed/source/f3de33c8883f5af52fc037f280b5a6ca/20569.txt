TEXT:
As you know, DOJ provided Bob Graham with technical assistance months ago
on a bill to facilitate Medicare tobacco claims. Bryant Hall has now
indicated that he wants to offer this legislation as amendment to
Commerce, State, Justice approps.   Peter -- when will that come to the
floor? The Senator's office will probably want DOJ to brief the Senator
about the issues between now and then.
