TEXT:
Lyn and I are late in getting you a welfare strategic plan draft --
sorry.  Lyn is swamped and I am somewhat busy too, but we will try to get
it done asap.  Let us know if there is some external deadline that is
impending, or whether we are just generally making you look bad.

On the NGA welfare stuff, I made the pat statement in my NGA comments that
"in our proposal the money goes to cities."   Lyn points out that there is
a rather confusing history on the role of the states in our welfare to
work initiative. Our paper has said the money goes to the cities, but Lyn
said this got somewhat murky when the Governors started yelling, and we
said orally the money would at least flow through the states.   I don't
know this history well, but perhaps my writeup doesn't reflect the full f
lavor of this issue. But I am not sure what does!     (Emily would probably
know, although she is totally swamped at this point.)
