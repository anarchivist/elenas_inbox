TEXT:
I have added one additional talking point at the end which I think is
particularly helpful.  Please use this revised set of talking points
instead of the version just sent.  Thanks!


I am providing you with talking points in response to the Washington Post
article of this morning.  Talking points received from HHS were not
inaccurate.  Please call me if you have any questions.


TALKING POINTS ON
MEDICAID EXPANSION TO PEOPLE WITH HIV

Background


In April, the Vice President directed the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) of HHS to determine the feasibility of establishing
a demonstration program to expand Medicaid coverage to people who were HIV
-- and do not currently qualify for Medicaid benefits.  This was in
response to a release by HHS of a standard of care for HIV and AIDS that
recommended early treatment.   The Vice President asked HHS to report back
within 30 days.

Under current regulations, Medicaid coverage is not availalable to many
individuals with HIV until they progress to AIDS; the new treatments offer
the promise of forestalling the progression to AIDS, creating a "catch 22"
whereby individuals can't get the drugs that would keep them from
progressing to AIDS until they get AIDS.


Talking Points

The Clinton Administration remains strongly comitted to insuring that
people living with HIV and AIDS have access to the medical treatments they
need.

The experts at HCFA are finding it difficult to make this expansion cost
neutral, which is the test that we must meet to change benefits without
Congressional action

The Administration is still in active dialogue with community members,
Congress, and public policy experts to refine the financial analysis -- we
have not shut the door on making this work

The anaylsis turned out to be far more complicated than many believed it
to be, so it is taking much more time than we thought it would.  However,
the Administration is still actively working on a solution to this problem.


Administration has a strong track record of addressing the needs of people
living with HIV and AIDS

the President recently signed a fiscal year 1998 appropriation bill that
provides $286 million for the State AIDS Drug Assistance Program, a 71%
increase from fiscal year 1997.

the President worked vigorously to save the Medicaid program, which is the
largest single payor for AIDS services and treatment in the country    in
1997, federal Medicaid expenditures for people living with HIV/AIDS
totaled $1.8 billion, including nearly $500 million for AIDS drugs.

the President has long been committed to health care for all Americans,
and is pleased with the incremental progress that has been made on a
bipartisan basis in recent years.  Insurance reform and increased access
to health insurance for children are important first steps.  But the
ultimate goal of high quality health insurance for all Americans remains.

In a moment of senility, I made an error in my line of explanation.  I
meant to say that the talking points from HHS were inaccurate.  Sorry.
