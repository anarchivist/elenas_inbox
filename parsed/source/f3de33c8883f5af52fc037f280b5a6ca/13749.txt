 There will be a briefing this coming Friday, June 7th, at 4:30
 p.m. in the CEQ conference room on the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem
 project, which is scheduled to be released publicly the following
 Monday, June 10th, in California.
 The Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project was mandated by Congress in
 1993 to conduct a comprehensive scientific review of the remaining
 old growth in the national forests in the Sierra Nevada, and to
 provide for a study of the entire Sierra Nevada ecosystem by an
 independent panel of scientists.  There will be considerable
 attention paid to it in California and in the press.
 The briefing team consists of the Chair of the Steering Committee
 who conducted the report (from the U. of California), the science
 team leader and a third scientist on the team.  They plan to brief
 the Congrssional delegation in the morning and Secretary Glickman
 and Babbitt in the early afternoon.


If you want to be briefed on this but can't make this session or
if you want further opportunity to discuss the report, there will
be a second sesssion in Katie's office around June 13-14th with
Jerry Franklin, of FEMAT fame, and Norm Johnson - two other
scientists of note who worked on this. We'll let you know when
that is scheduled. However, those of you who want immediate
information about the scope and general thrust of the report may
want to come to the Friday afternooon briefing.
