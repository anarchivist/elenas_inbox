TEXT:
I understand that Rep. Franks and Sen. Torricelli plan to introduce a bill
tomorrow to preclude payment of Social Security benefits to those who
participated in Nazi persecutions or genocide.   DOJ has provided
technical assistance to ensure the bill does not interfere with their Nazi
war criminal prosecutions, and is apparently comfortable with the bill as
revised, but knows not to take a position until we have one.   The sponsors
have asked one of the DOJ lawyers to be on hand tomorrow to answer any
technical questions, which seems OK to me.  SSA has always generally been
supportive of this idea (in part because of some bad press they've gotten
in the past) .

DOJ will get a copy of the bill and circulate it around for review so we
can decide if we want to take a position on it. Last year, when there
were concerns about the bill and its effect on our Nazi persecutions, we
avoided taking a position.  With staff changes at NEC I'm going to reach
out to Bill Dauster and let him know about this.
