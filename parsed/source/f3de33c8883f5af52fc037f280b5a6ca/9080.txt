         The following is a summary of the Household Survey findings for the
         weekly.  You may, however, want to abreviate and submit as part of the
         daily report for Thursday ... jc3

         Drugs -- Household Survey: On Friday, HHS and ONDCP will release the 1997
         National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Some highlight's from the 1997
         survey include:

         Overall drug use flat -- The total number of Americans who are current
         drug users (or those who used illicit drugs during the past 30 days) did
         not change significantly between 1996 and 1997 (from 13 million to 13.9
         million), and remains nearly 50% below its peak in 1979 (25 million).

         Youth Drug Use Up -- The number of youth (12 to 17-year olds) who were
         current drug users increased from 9% in 1996 to 11.4% in 1997 -- reversing
         last year's drop from 10.9% in 1995. The rate was highest in 1979 (16.3%)
         and lowest in 1992 (5.3%).

         Marijuana a Big Problem -- The prevalence of marijuana use among youth
         more than doubled from 1992 to 1997 and increased significantly from 7.1%
         in 1996 to 9.4% in 1997. This is still less than the 14.2% estimate for
         1979.

         Cocaine Use Stable -- The overall number of cocaine users did not change
         significantly in 1997 (from 1.75 million to 1.5 million), and remained
         well below its peak in 1985 (5.7 million) .

         Increasing Heroin Use -- The number of current heroin users has increased
         from 68,000 in 1992 to 325,000 1997. Still, heroin users remains a
         relatively small percentage of the drug-using population (from less than
         .1% in 1992 to .2% in 1997).

         Lots of New, Young Users -- The 1997 Survey also estimates that there were
         2.5 million first-time drug users in 1996. This includes the highest rate
         of first-time marijuana, cocaine and heroin use by youth (12 to 17-year
         olds) in 30 years, and a near doubling of the rate of new hallucinogen
         users observed during the 1980s.  (NB: Data on new initiates is collected
         one year behind the survey's data on current use and often signals future
         increases in drug use.)

         Alcohol/Tobacco Use Stable -- The overall number of Americans using
         alcohol and tobacco did not change significantly from 1996 to 1997.
         Overall, 111 million Americans aged 12 and over were current users of


  alcohol. This includes 32 million binge drinkers (5 or more drinks on one
  occasion) and 11 million heavy drinkers (5 or more drinks 5 times a
  month).   Eleven million current drinkers were between the ages of 12 and
  20 years old, including 4.8 million binge drinkers and 2 million heavy
  drinkers.

  Sixty-four million Americans aged 12 and older -- or about 30% -- reported
  smoking in the past 30 days in 1997. This includes 4.5 million youth
  between the ages of 12 and 20 years old -- or about 20%. Although these
  rates are similar to the 1996 estimates, the number of 12-13 year olds
  that smoked increased from 7.3% in 1996 to 9.7% in 1997.
