TEXT:
AS WRITTEN:
These HMOs say they are just looking after their bottom line. Well, I
believe the health of our parents must be AmericaD,s bottom line.  I am
determined to do everything in my power to protect older Americans dropped
by their HMOs and to make sure this doesnD,t happen again.  Today, we are
taking three steps:


AS DELIVERED:

             Now, these HMOs say they are looking after the bottom
line. All of you who understand the Medicare program know that the
reimbursement rates are different across regions and in different
areas. We have tried very hard to alleviate that -- the problems'
with that system. And we recognize that there were problems; we have
worked to alleviate them.  But that wasn't what we were   asked to
do. We were asked just to give all HMOs permission to raise rates
whether they needed to or not, without regard to how much money they
were making or not.  And I think that was wrong.

             We have to do everything we can to protect Americans who
have been dropped by their HMOs and to protect the health care
options of all seniors in the future.
