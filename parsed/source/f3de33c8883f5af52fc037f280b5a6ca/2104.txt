TEXT:
I showed the version we both had to Robert Malley at NSC (who did the
drafting)-- he confirmed that this was the most recent draft going into
today's meeting.  He said Sylvia's draft was older than what we had.  He
said he would get us talking points with today's revisions.

Were you planning on getting him the language on the budget?    I can be
responsible for getting it to him if you prefer.

As a mea culpa, I realized that during my rambling description yesterday
of the suspension of deportation provision, I erroneously talked about the
case-by-case waiver, which instead applies to bars on admission and
re-entry.  (Yes, that annoying sound is my head hitting my computer!)

Let me know how you want to handle getting NSC the buget language.    Thanks.
