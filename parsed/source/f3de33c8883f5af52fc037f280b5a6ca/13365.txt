TEXT:
We've received only one comment- DOJ asked that we change the
punchline to read we support "House passage" rather than
"enactment.   II

REASON: The Office of Tribal Justice would like to get the bill
amended in the Senate to specifically state that charitable
gambling should be examined. The current version directs the
Commission to study gambling in the US and specifically mentions
State-sponsored lotteries, casino gambling, pari-mutuel betting,
and sports betting. Charitable gambling could presumably be
covered under the Commission's charge to also look at "other such
relevant topics and issues as considered appropriate by the
Chairman of the Commission" but the Office of Tribal Justice would
like to make it explicit.
DOJ's suggestion seems OK to me -- in fact we use "House passage"
more than enactment.  I chose the latter because of the
President's letter.
Do you have any objection to making this change?
