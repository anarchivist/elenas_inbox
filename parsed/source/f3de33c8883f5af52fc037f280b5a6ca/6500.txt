                                        Tobacco Q&A
                                        March 2, 1998



Q:   What's the point of the letter that Bruce Reed sent to Senator McCain?

A:   The letter is an example of how the Administration is reaching across party lines to help
     Congress enact comprehensive legislation to dramatically reduce teen smoking. The
     letter provides detailed responses to 74 questions posed by Senator McCain, arid reiterates
     the President's strong view that a piecemeal approach will not meet our overriding goal
     of dramatically reducing teen smoking. As you know, the President has called upon
     Congress to enact comprehensive, bipartisan legislation which raises the price of
     cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, expressly confirms the FDA
     authority to regulate tobacco products, gets tobacco companies out of the business of
     marketing to children, furthers public health research and goals, and protects tobacco
     farmers and their communities. Because of the particular questions posed by Senator
     McCain, the letter focuses to a great extent on the importance of restricting the
     advertising and marketing of tobacco products to young people.

Q:   I understand that in your response to Senator McCain, you said that there are
     constitutional concerns with imposing certain advertising restrictions on the tobacco
     industry. Does that mean you need the consent of the industry to impose
     advertising restrictions?

A:   It is absolutely clear that certain advertising restrictions can be put in place with or
     without the agreement of the industry. We strongly believe, as the Department of Justice
     has explained at length in the FDA litigation, that the FDA's regulations restricting the
     advertising of tobacco products are consistent with the First Amendment. As our
     response to Senator McCain notes, there may be constitutional issues with more
     far-reaching provisions. We have not concluded that these provisions clearly are
     unconstitutional, but we would like to work with Senator McCain and others to minimize
     constitutional difficulties. We do believe that legislation which imposes tough financial
     penalties against companies if reductions in teen tobacco use are not met will encourage
     the industry to impose these stronger advertising limits voluntarily. But in any event, we
     will not seek -- and do not need -- the industry's permission to enact a strong bill that
     addresses youth smoking through a substantial price increase, limits on access, and
     certain advertising restrictions.

     provisions?

A:   We addressed each of the speech restrictions that Senator McCain asked us about, and
     informed him whether or not it raised serious constitutional issues. For those that we
     believe do raise constitutional issues, we offered the full assistance of the Administration
     in working with his staffto draft specific legislative provisions. The precise degree to
     which a provision would raise constitutional issues is related to specific legislative
     language and such detailed drafting issues couldn't be addressed in a letter like this.

Q:   What does the letter say about the Administration's views of anti-trust exemptions?

A:   The letter makes clear that we are extremely skeptical of antitrust exemptions. In
     particular, we would oppose any that would allow price fixing agreements. The letter
     does leave open the possibility, depending on the overall legislation, of allowing very
     limited anti-trust exemptions to facilitate efforts to restrict advertising to minors.
