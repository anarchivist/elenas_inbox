TEXT:
Engler has taken DOL to court over the privatization issue. He asked for
a TRO on DOL's plans to shut off the flow of money, but he lost.  But
there is a hearing of some sort on Friday.  The money has been shut off.

DOL continues not to be very proactive, to say the least, about keeping us
in the loop about developments like this.  Uhalde told me that they keep
Podesta informed, and that Geri Palast talks to WH intergovernmental
(although according to Emily, she doesn't hear much either).  I told him
that they should keep us informed as things happen.

He gave me a page of talking points that I will forward to Emily and
Cynthia.
