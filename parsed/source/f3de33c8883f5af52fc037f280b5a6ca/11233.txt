MEMORANDUM FOR               ************DRAFT************************

RE: Ed-Flex

Description of Program
The Education Flexibility (Ed-Flex) Partnership Demonstration Program was established by the
Goals 2000: Educate America Act. Under Ed-Flex, states can waive certain federal rules and
regulations in order to promote state and local school improvement efforts in exchange for
greater accountability for student progress. To apply for status as an Ed-Flex state, states must
have a comprehensive school improvement plan approved by the Secretary, and must waive their
own statutory or regulatory requirements, while holding districts and schools affected by the
waivers accountable for academic performance. Ed-Flex allows the Secretary of Education to
delegate this authority to up to 12 states.

A State may waive requirements relating to several programs that are authorized as part of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), including Title I, Eisenhower Professional
Development, Safe and Drug-Free schools and Even Start. Before granting a waiver, a State
must first determine that the underlying purposes of the affected program will continue to be met.
Ed-Flex does not apply to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), or to
requirements pertaining to health, safety, civil rights, and parental participation in education.
The twelve states with Ed-Flex authority are: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Vermont.

Administration Support of Ed-Flex
The President and Secretary Riley have been very supportive of this program. Ed-Flex was
originally proposed in 1994 by Sen Hatfield as an amendment, supported by the administration,
to Goals 2000. When Goals 2000 was enacted, up to six states could be designated as Ed-Flex
states. In 1995, Sen Specter added an amendment in appropriations to expand the number of
Ed-Flex states to twelve. At last year's NGA meeting, the President announced his support for
legislation to expand the ED-Flex program to all 50 states (assuming they met program eligibility
requirements). That bill, passed out of committee in the Senate, but did not move in the House.
This year, an Ed-flex bill has again been passed out of committee and is pending floor action in
the Senate.

Although'we supported a free-standing Ed-Flex bill last year, at that point we were more than a
year away from reauthorization of ESEA. Now, are at best only a couple of months away from
Congress taking up ESEA. Since Ed-Flex allows waivers of ESE A provisions, it makes most
sense to consider Ed-Flex as part of the ESEA reauthorization. This would ensure that Ed-Flex is
designed to fit the federal education programs of the next five years, rather than the last five years.


Also, it is essential that an Ed-Flex provision strike the right balance between flexibility and
accountability for results. In November of 1998, a GAO report gave Ed-FLEX mixed reviews in
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


terms of its effectiveness. Specifically, states vary tremendously as to the extent to which they
assess and monitor the impact of the waivers on student achievement. As we move forward on
Ed-Flex, we need to determine how we can ensure that we are holding states and districts
accountable for performance.

If Congress does take up Ed-Flex prior to ESEA reauthorization, the President will insist that it is
consistent with his approach to ESEA and that it include tough accountability measures. In
addition, the President will support efforts to take up other parts of his education agenda at the
same time --particularly his proposal to reduce class size.

Congressional and Constituency Group Issues
Senate democrats (Kennedy/Dodd) have raised concerns about accountability and effectiveness
of the Ed-Flex program Realizing that the bill will probably move, they want to ensure that a
tough accountability mechanism is included. In the House, reservations have been expressed by
Rep. Clay and others about considering Ed-Flex separately from the ESEA reauthorization. Civil
Rights groups are concerned that the waivers not be used in a manner that would result in the
funds -- especially in the Title I program-- not going to the children in the greatest need (e.g. a
state allowing schools that do not meet the poverty threshold to become eligible for Title I
funds).

Examples of Waivers Granted by Ed-Flex States
The Fort Worth, Texas School District received a waiver allowing it to target an extra portion of
its Title I dollars to four high poverty, inner-city elementary schools. The schools were chosen
for a complete overhaul due to low achievement on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills
and other factors. Each school uses Title I funds to improve instruction for all its students and is
reorganizing staff, lengthening the school year, enhancing instruction in reading and math,
providing extensive teacher training, and strengthening links to the community. Without this
waiver, these high-need schools would not have received as much funding.

Montgomery County Schools in Troy, North Carolina received a waiver permitting Troy
Elementary School to implement a schoolwide program even though the percentage of children
from low-income families at the school (45.75%) is slightly below the statutory minimum
poverty threshold (50%) required for schoolwide programs. The school has undergone extensive
planning to implement its schoolwide program, which promotes the integration of resources and
emphasizes continual assessments of students' progress. This waiver for a school-wide program
enables the school to use its Title I resources to strengthen instruction for the entire school, rather
than providing services to individual students.
