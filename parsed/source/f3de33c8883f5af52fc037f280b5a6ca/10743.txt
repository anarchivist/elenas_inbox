TEXT:
probably the version I have is now obsolete (1/12/99 3:30 p.m. draft), but
the SOTU section on teacher quality I read seemed too negative to me.  I
would think we could achieve the objective of highlighting all we are
doing to make sure every child is taught by a qualified teacher by
balancing the positive (supporting new teachers with mentors, encouraging
more professional development opportunities etc.) with the negative
(competency tests, removing poor teachers) .
