TEXT:
FYI, results of this morning's women's meeting this morning:  the group
decided that sometime in the next two weeks we would bring in a small
group of pollsters and experts to hear the results of Celinda Lake's new
research and to discuss strategy for broadening the reprodutive rights
agenda. Ellen Lovell is going to take the lead on setting up this meeting
and urged the group to think about who should be invited to this meeting
and get back to her quickly with recommendations (she is thinking about
roughly five outside people, including Planned Parenthood, Guttmacher, for
example). Ellen also strongly cautioned against talking about this
meeting with folks from the outside. This small meeting would precede a
larger strategy meeting with advocates and experts.

Ann Lewis emphasized the need to follow a three-pronged agenda with the
women's/reproductive rights groups -- upholding the veto, expanding the
reproductive rights agenda and supporting women's health generally.
