 PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
 RADIO ADDRESS ON GUN SHOWS
 THE WHITE HOUSE
 February 6, 1999

            Good morning.   Six years ago, I determined that Washington had to


get off the sidelines and join the frontlines in the fight against crime.
I committed my administration to recovering our streets from violence, to
reclaiming our neighborhoods as safe havens for families.  Since then, we
have pursued a new strategy of law enforcement based not on tough talk but
on tougher penalties, better prevention, and the substantial, visible
presence of community police.

         Our strategy is showing remarkable results. Since 1993, crime
 rates in America have fallen to the lowest point in a quarter century.
 Property crime is down; violent crime has dropped 20 percent in the last
 six years; and the murder rate is the lowest in 30 years. Americans can
 take pride in streets that are safer; but, mostly, they can take comfort
 in lives that are more secure.

        There are many reasons that crime is on a sharp decline.  Chief
among them is our ability to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.   Gun
trafficking and gun-related crime are on the wane; and it is no wonder:
according to a recent report by the Justice Department, the background
checks we required in the Brady law have put a stop to [nearly a quarter
million] handgun purchases. Thanks to Brady, we turn away [118] felons a
day, sending them home empty-handed instead of well armed. And the
Insta-Check system that took effect last November is allowing us to
conduct even more checks -- in even less time.

         Retail gun stores, sporting goods stores, licensed gun dealers
they are all working to keep guns out of the hands of felons and
fugitives.   But there is a loophole in the law, and criminals know how to
exploit it: They go to gun shows. Last year, there were more than 4,400
gun shows across America.   I come from a state where these shows are very
popular.   I have visited and enjoyed them over the years.  I know they are
the first place where many parents teach their children how to handle
firearms safely.

        But at the same time, and at too many gun shows, criminals are
buying guns with no questions asked. ThatD,s because the law permits some
dealers -- one quarter to one half of the vendors at a typical gun show
to skip the background checks required by Brady. That is a dangerous
loophole.  It is wide enough that criminals reach right through it,
grabbing, collectively, thousands of firearms that disappear without a
trace.

        Last fall, I asked the Attorney General and the Secretary of the
Treasury -- who join me here today -- to report on the problem and to come
up with solutions.  I now have their report.  It is sensible -- and
sobering.  It shows conclusively that gun shows are a forum for gun
traffickers -- a cash-and-carry convenience store for weapons used to maim
and to kill.

        We must close this loophole.  America cannot allow its gun shows
to become illegal arms bazaars, where law-breakers shop side-by-side with
the law-abiding. That is why I strongly support the recommendations of
Attorney General Reno and Secretary Rubin.  We should extend Brady checks
and gun tracing records to any and all open markets where large numbers of
firearms are sold. And we should vigorously and fairly enforce the rules.

        To toughen enforcement of the existing law, my balanced budget
includes new funds to hire ne
