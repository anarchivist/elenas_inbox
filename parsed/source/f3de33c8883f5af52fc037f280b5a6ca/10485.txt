Elena and Mike

I had a phone call with the Education Department yesterday on the $18
million Troops to Teachers (TTT) proposal we have been considering. Based
on this conversation, I would recommend the following approach for Troops
to Teachers (TTT) , and by extension Title II of HEA. I would:
1) Put $3 million in the budget for TTT.   This would allow the operation
to continue, paying for the national TTT center and their 20 state centers
around the nation. We would propose legislation next year that would
transfer authority to administer this program from the Defense Department
to the Education Department. Senator Robb (the most active Dem on this
issue) would support this, though he wants    a
                                              higher appropriation level.
The $3 million would not cover some of the additional components that Robb
wants -- i.e. new stipends to help retiring troops get the coursework they
need to get certified and induction grants that would enable school
districts to provide some extra support to the troops in their first year
of teaching.
        2) Use the remaining $15 million to increase the appropriation
level for Title II of    HEA. This would (if coupled with a proposal to
increase th~ percentage of Title II funding               targeted to
recruitment and scholarships) support recruitment efforts targeted at
young people,   troops, and other mid-career professionals.
Partnerships interested in focusing on troops could       apply for this
funding on a competitive basis.

           Let me know if you need more information on this.
