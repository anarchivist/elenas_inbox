TEXT:
I should have thought of this earlier, but maybe there will be another
stage of this pillars process--is it worth adding a consumerism category
to the pillars? Something like "Protecting Consumers in the New Economy."
Among the options would be consolidating government consumer 800 numbers
into one line, background checks on nursing home employees, privacy, food
safety, managed care (I think it is in there), debit cards, maybe alcohol
awareness as a succesor to tobacco.

The only others I see we could do are native Americans (we have a memo for
you in new issues), hate crimes (a new US attorney task force could be
ready to announce at the conference), and various violence against women
intiiatives ...
