Race and Service Link -- The attached column by Steve Waldman of U.S. News argues that
service by people of diverse backgrounds, such as AmeriCorps' CityYear program, does more to
foster diversity and racial understanding than dialogue or more traditional efforts to promote
racial harmony. Harris Wofford has also forwarded that column to you with a suggestion that
the race initiative focus more on common action by Americans of different backgrounds.

You indicated earlier that you are interested in performing service yourself on Martin Luther
King Day, in recognition both of Dr. King and the movement to make the holiday "a day on, not
a day off." One option we are exploring is that you could spend time on January 19th at a
literacy project connected to D.C. Reads, with AmeriCorps members, local work-study students,
and senior volunteers participating. We would invite children in kindergarten to third grade,
along with their parents and/or tutors. The Corporation suggests that, in addition to having
reading stations, the kids would assemble and decorate a small bookshelf, which they could then
take home along with five or ten books to start their collection.
