TEXT:
AP is beginning work on a major series on child labor abuse, both
internationally and in the US. They are talking to the Labor Department,
but were wondering if there was anyone at the White House that follows
that issue. Is there anyone you can think of? Would they be in DPC?

Thanks in advance -- Kathy
