TALKING POINTS ON TOBACCO
CABINET ROOM
July 19, 1998

         I am about to meet with my economic team to discuss the ways we
can keep our economy growing steady and strong.    Today, AmericaO,s economy
is the strongest in a generation, and is the driving force behind world
economic growth . . We will be discussing ways to continue this growth:
promoting international economic stability, by supporting the IMF and
economic reform in Asia O(maintaininq our fiscal discipline by setting
aside the surplus until we save Social Security first O( investing in our
people through education and training.    We cannot afford to risk our
prosperity through gimmicks such as repealing the tax code with nothing in
its place. We must seize the opportunity of this moment to build for our
long-term prosperity.

        I want to briefly comment on another obligation we face at this
moment of national progress: the duty to protect our children from tobacco.
  After decades .of deception by the tobacco industry, there is now
undeniable evidence that they have targeted children.   We have a chance to
save one million lives a year.   For six months, we worked hard and in good
faith to meet all legitimate objections to this legislation, and to join
together the priorities of both parties.

        Let me be clear: every Senator who voted to kill the tobacco bill
voted against a tax cut for middle income families; against new measures
to crack down on drugs; against life-saving research into cancer and other
diseases.  Every Senator who voted to kill the tobacco bill voted not to
save one million American lives.   It was a vote against our children and
for the tobacco lobby. And that vote will be very difficult to explain to
the American people.

        Now,some have suggested that the Congress will follow the tobacco
lobbyO,s lead and seek to send to me a watered-down tobacco industry bill
that will not truly cut youth smoking. AmericaO,s public health experts
agree: we wonO,t be able to reduce youth smoking dramatically unless we


act on a number of fronts at one time: a substantial price increase,
strong advertising restrictions, strong access restrictions, strong
surcharges on companies that continue to sell to youth. We need a tough
tobacco bill -- not a tobacco industry bill. We need to protect our
children, not the tobacco industry.  Not a O&narrow08 bill that reflects
narrow interests, but a comprehensive bill that cuts down on youth smoking.
