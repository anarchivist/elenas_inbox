    TEXT:
    I am sorry I keep forgetting to ask you this question.  When VP met w/
    Sandy Feldman, Pres AFT -- Sandy asked whether in our national testing
    proposal which she supports we could fashion a role for NCES. Sandy said
    she is very concerned about NAGBE's role in designing and implementing the
    test. Apparently, there is a GAO report critical of NAGBE's technical
    ability. She asked whether NCES could be relied upon for their technical
    expertise in design and implementation. We told her we would investigate
    the possibility. Let me know whether this is doable -- thanks!
