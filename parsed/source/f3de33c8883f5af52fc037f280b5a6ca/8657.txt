TEXT:
Bruce you asked if we could find quotes from company documents about young
females and smoking.  Jerry has turned up several -- do you like any of
them?

1984 RJ Reynolds document:

1) "The dominant trend in the younger adult smoker market over the last 50
years has been the rising importance of females."

2) "Younger adult female smokers were the key growth sector in the 1970's
and 1980's."

3) A 1976 Philip Morris document examined a "profile of the teen-age girl
smoker" done by Yankelovich for the American Cancer Society. No quotes
stand out except maybe

"The profile of the teen-age girl smoker counters the image of a socially
ill-at-ease youngster turning to cigarettes as a means of being thought of
as more sophisticated or as a needed prop for handling social situations.
Instead it is the teen-age girl smoker who is at ease socially, very put
together, and with full confidence in herself."

Here's what the speech has now:

With the help of the courts, these documents are becoming public.  The
documents tell us -- in the tobacco companiesD, own words -- how children
and minorities became pawns in their efforts to recruit new customers.
There are memos admitting in plain English that "the base of our business
is the high school student." Memos saying that "creating a fad [in the
14-20 year old] market can be a great bonanza" for the tobacco company.
And even as industry spokespeople insisted that young people were
off-limits for advertising strategies, one company document from 1984
recommended targeting "younger adult smokers" because they were the only
source of "replacement smokers" in the future.

                                                   July 15, 1998

           Q.   What is your reaction to the House vote (276-150) on the Child Custody Protection
                Act?

           A.   We are disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that we proposed to this
                legislation. We have repeatedly stated that we would support properly crafted legislation
                that would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines in order to avoid parental
                involvement requirements.

                We asked the House to amend the bill to exclude close family members from criminal
                and civil liability. Under the legislation, grandmothers, aunts and siblings could face
                criminal prosecution for coming to the aid of a relative in distress. We also asked the
                House to amend the bill so that individuals who provide only infonnation, counseling,
                referral, or medical services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. Finally, the
                Department of Justice recommended changes to address constitutional problems raised by
                the legislation.

                These proposed changes would preserve the goal ofthe legislation to prevent the
                circumvention of state parental involvement laws, while both ensuring that minors are not
                isolated from close family members and preserving healthy family communications.

           Q.   Would the President veto the bill if it is sent to him in its current form?

           A.   We strongly oppose the bill in its current fonn. If Congress is truly interested in passing
                legislation, and not creating another partisan political issue, it will amend the bill as we
                requested.
