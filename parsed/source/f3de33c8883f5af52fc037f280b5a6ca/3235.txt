                       PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                RADIO ADDRESS ON DECREASED WELFARE ROLLS
                             THE WHITE HOUSE
                                JULY 4,1997

        Good morning_ We come together this weekend with family and friends to celebrate
Independence Day, our national heritage, and the fundamental values that unite us as one
America: In America, everyone should have an equal chance to succeed. And everyone has an
obligation to work hard, to give something back to their community, to eam in each generation
the freedom that our Founders established.

        These are the values that have guided our effort to end welfare as we know it. Today, I
want to talk to you about the progress we have made over the past four and a half years, the
changes now underway, and what we must all do to make sure that welfare reform honors those
values, too.

        For four years, my administration has been committed to putting an end to the old welfare
system that created a culture of dependency, and trapped too many families in a cycle of despair,
preventing them from participating in the fullness of American life. Working with the states we
launched welfare reform experiments that brought nearly 75% of all welfare recipients under new
rules that emphasize work and responsibility.

       Then last summer, I signed historic legislation that revolutionized welfare. It was a
dramatic step, but we knew that the time was right to put an end to a system that was broken
beyond repair. This week, that old welfare system came to an end. Now a new system based
on work is taking its place. This system that demands responsibility, not only from the people
we are requiring to work, but from every American.

        We knew last August that the new welfare reform law was not a guarantee, but a
bold new experiment. And so far, our experiment is working. I am pleased to announce
that today, there are 3 million fewer people on welfare than there were on the day I took
office - a remarkable 1.3 million since I signed welfare reform into law. And a new study
by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco shows that 500,000 single mothers have joined the
job market since I signed welfare reform into law last August.

       We have proven that we can begin to put an end to the culture of dependency, and elevate
our most fundamental values offamily and work and responsibility. Now we must continue to
work together to meet our goal of moving one million more people from welfare to work by the
year 2000.
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
         Since I took office, the economy has added 12.8 million new jobs -- and economists
believe that we will continue to produce the jobs we need to meet our challenge. But even so, it
will not be easy. Some of the people who must move from welfare to work have poor job
skills; some have never worked before; still others live in struggling communities, far from
jobs. We cannot let these problems become barriers to our success - instead, we must do
everything we can to remove the barriers to work.

        The national government will do its part. First, the balanced budget agreement we
reached with Congress in May provides $3 billion for welfare-to-work efforts all over the
country. It gives private employers tax incentives to hire long term welfare recipients.
[And I believe that every one of those new workers should earn at least the minimum wage and
receive the protections of existing employment laws.]

        Second, we must help welfare recipients get to the new jobs which are overwhelmingly
located in the suburbs. That is why I recently proposed legislation that provides $600 million to
help states and local communities devise transportation strategies to move people move from
welfare to work.

        Third, we must make sure that mothers who must now go to work have good child
care
- and adequate health care - for their children. That is why I made sure that the welfare
reform bill includes $4 billion in child care assistance. And that is why I fought for the
balanced budget agreement to extend health care coverage to millions of uninsured
children.

       States must also do their part. From this week on, every state must have a place in plan
to move people from welfare to work. Many of these plans are already in place ... and already
working. Wisconsin and Florida are significantly increasing their investment in child care. In
Oregon, they are providing health care and transportation support for welfare recipients, and
subsidizing public and private sector jobs with money that used to pay for food stamps and other
aid. And today, I want to encourage every state to use the authority the welfare reform law gives
them, and take what had been welfare checks and turn them into paychecks.

        But as much as the national and state goverments can do to move people from welfare to
work, we know that the vast majority of the jobs must be created by private business. The most
lasting way to bring people on welfare into the mainstream of American life is with a solid job in
a private business. To every business person who ever criticized the old system, I say: the old
system is gone. And it is up to you to help make the new system work.

        This Independence Day, all Americans should be happy that 3 million of our fellow
citizens are offthe welfare rolls. As we celebrate our nation's past and the values that unite us,
we must look forward to the future, and redouble our detennination to put an end to the culture
of dependence.
