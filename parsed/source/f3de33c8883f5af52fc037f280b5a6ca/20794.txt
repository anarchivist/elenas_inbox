We would like to add this to the piece you saw earlier.   Comments?


In addition, the amendment would impose an unfunded, expensive and
extremely burdensome administrative requirement on the City, requiring it
to set up a new system to separately track expenditures to ensure that no
Federal funds were used to implement one particular City ordinance.
Imposing such an expensive and unique requirement on one, single city in
the United States would establish a new and far-reaching precedent that
could be applied to render prohibitively expensive any local ordinance
passed by any city or town in the country.
