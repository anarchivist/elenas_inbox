TEXT:
It seems to me that it will be extremely difficult for the Child Care
Working Group to finish its work before the State of the Union, given the
difficulty of even 'choosing the members and finding times for CEOs to
meet. It also occurs .to me that this might not matter - - because the
group will focus not on what the Federal government should do, but instead
on what businesses themselves can do. What do you think?
