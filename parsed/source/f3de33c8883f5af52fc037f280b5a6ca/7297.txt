TEXT:
I dropped off our draft legislative language earlier this evening to
George Fishman (Smith) and Tina Hone (Watt) and faxed the language to Zoe
Lofgren's staff. George just called back informing me that they would
have a final bill tommorrow (it was drafted over the weekend) which he
would share with us tomorrow evening after Lamar Smith meets with his
fellow Republicans on the Subcommittee. While declining to give details,
he said that although we would not like the bill's increase in the caps,
we would like all of the other provisions.  He did indicate that we would
not like the bill's failure to contain other provisions (my read of this
comment is that they left the training piece out). Watt's staff and
Lofgren's staff indicate that they did not have any input in the bill over
the weekend.  Finally, I have to confess that I gave George a draft of our
language on Friday (anticipating that he would draft over the weekend) and
he indicated that some of our language has been included. We shall see.

After they introduce the measure tomorrow they plan to markup in
Subcommittee on Thursday, in full Committee next week and on the House
floor the week after that.  Stay tuned.
