TEXT:
You'd asked me to check on the status of the wine label issue at
Treasury. The matter is a regulatory one (the ATF was petitioned by
various private parties for the right to use this label) and Rob Weiner is
looking into what involvement we can have.  I do have a substantive update
on the issue -- it is public knowledge via the press that that the
decision has been made by Treasury to approve the petition.  HHS did write
letters to ATF expressing concern about the health effects of this
decision.  I'm out tommorow & Fri.  but will leave all the relevant info
with Mary.
