    Subject: FLSA

          At some point this week, we should have a chat about FLSA.     I think
    my
         boss is (believe it or not) with the Administration on this issue,
         although I still need to confirm this.   If the Majority follows Ways
         and Means on this issue, my first thought is to try to strike the
         state option to include other benefits and concede the "not
    employees"
         and TANF+food stamps calculation.   (I don't have a lot of confidence
    I
          can get all the Dems to that position, let along going any further
    but
         we haven't really talked it through yet.)   But I wouldn't be
    surprised
         if you all want a pure motion to strike.

          Moynihan is meeting with McEntee late today.  I should have a better
          sense of where we're at after that.  But I don't see a lot of
          go-to-the-mat labor champs on our committee.
