 DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

         June 17, 1998
         (House)




 H.R. 3725 - Postal Service Health and Safety Promotion Act
 (Greenwood (R) PA and' one other)

The Administration supports enactment of H.R. 3725, a bill that would
apply the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act to
the United States Postal Service in the same manner as any private
employer, including the imposition of penalties for safety and health
violations.   However, the Administration also believes that all public
employees should receive the complete protection of the OSH Act, and
urges the Congress to expand the billD,s coverage to include all Federal,
State and local government empl'oyees. Al though twenty- three States
already provide full OSH Act coverage for their public employees, the
remainder do not.  Federal employees also lack the full protection of the
Act.
