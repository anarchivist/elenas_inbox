I know you're incredibly busy, but have you had a chance to look at this
yet?

Also, the Distilled Spirits Council letter needs to go out ASAP.  Leanne
Shimabukuro said she was working on the draft with you.  What is the
status of this?

Thanks!

Subject:         Abortion Clinic Access letter

Elena,
Jenn Klein said I should talk to you about updating the Abortion Clinic
Access/Violence form letter.  I'm not sure how to handle the paragraph on
FACE (highlighted in blue). Can you help with this? thanks.

the current Abortion Clinic Violence/Access form letter
 Thank you for your letter.

     I am concerned about violence against abortion clinics. As a
nation committed to the rule of law, we cannot allow vigilantes to
restrict the rights of American women. No person seeking medical
care and no physician providing that care should have to endure
harassment, threats, or intimidation.

     While the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act makes it a
federal crime for protesters to use force or physical obstruction
with the intention of injuring, intimidating, or interfering with
individuals seeking or providing abortion-related services, it does
protect the right to peaceful assembly.

     Personal privacy is a fundamental liberty protected by
the Constitution.  The right to privacy includes the freedom to make
difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding abortion,
without governmental interference.  I support a
woman's constitutional right to make this difficult decision, but I


believe that we must reduce the need for abortion.  By providing
better family planning services and improved education programs, we
can help reduce the number of abortions.  In addition, I believe
that abstinence and sex education should be taught.

I hope that our common concerns for the future of America will
unite us.  I appreciate your sincerity and your candor.
