 TEXT:
 We are having our regularly scheduled education strategy meeting at 5:15
 today in Bruce's office, which we have been using to develop the ESEA
 reauthorization proposal. Today's meeting will focus on the design of a
 grant program to continue support for standards-based reform.

 We will meet tomorrow at 5:00 will focus on accountability issues POTUS
 has raised since reviewing our memo.
