TEXT:
Two sticking points and where we are at on solutions:

1.    The Robb proposal for a 40 cent decline in the value of quota to
  improve export ability of growers.  Rather than have a figure in
  legislation, (some like it high, some low) I proposed a USDA study to
. determine the appropriate level which would then be transmitted to
  Congress (the figure is set eventually in· legislation) .

2. A double dipping problem in which flue-cured quota owner/growers get a
buy-out but remain in the program. Robb argues that to be made whole this
group should be compensated for the lose of the quota as an asset for sale
or rent, even though they remain in the program. I've suggested that for
owner/growers we diminsh the buyout figure of $8 by the new value of the
liscense they receive.

Everyone still agrees to $2.1 billio.n a year and I have stressed the
urgency of reaching an agreement very soon.   Robb is going back to his
growers to see if he can do this. USDA has concerns: they think growers
will be distrustful of USDA recommendations on price.   They also have
doubts about setting a fair estimate on the value of a liscense, but we
are setting a value on a quota so I don't see why this has to be an
impossible obstacle.
