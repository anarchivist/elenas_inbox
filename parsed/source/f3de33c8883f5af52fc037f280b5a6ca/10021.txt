century

after speaking with jose, i think that he'll support your proposal for a
'safe cops' program that provides $250 million annually for investments
that would provide federal, state and local law enforcement with the
equipment needed to operate safely in a 21st century communications
environment (i need to work the fluff), and paid for with a fee on use of
analog spectrum.

jose also wants an entirely separate 'cops 2' initiative. i think we all
agree that if there is to be such an initiative, it should be paid for
from the vcrtf or from general fund -- and not from any source of funding
that might be controversial.

with this clarification of jose's views, would you support the safe cops /
analog fee proposal?
