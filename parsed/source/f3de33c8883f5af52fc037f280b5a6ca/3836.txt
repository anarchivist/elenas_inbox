                                CHILDREN'S HEALTH

Q:   YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD NOT SIGN A CHILDREN'S BILL THAT
     DID NOT ENSURE MEANINGFUL HEALTH BENEFITS, INCLUDING
     PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, VISION AND HEARING, AND MENTAL
     HEALTH SERVICES. YET THE PACKAGE THAT PASSED DOES NOT
     GUARANTEE THESE VERY BENEFITS. HOW CAN YOU VIEW THIS AS
     A WIN?

A:   Without any doubt, this children's health bill is a win. Children will get benefits no
     less generous than those received by Federal and state employees or those families in
     the most popular HMO in the state. I would not settle for less. On top of that, these
     plans' prescription drugs, vision, hearing, and mental health coverage must be
     meaningful. These benefits are important to children's healthy development.

     Beyond the benefits, our support for the increase in the tobacco tax raised the
     investment from $16 billion to $24 billion. The new tobacco tax will not only further
     reduce the number of uninsured children, but it will serve as a financial barrier to help
     prevent our children from starting smoking in the first place.


Q:   DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH PACKAGE GIVES
     ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO THE STATES?

A:   I believe that the children's health initiative has struck the appropriate balance between
     needed flexibility and accountability. In order to ensure success, there is no question
     that federal, state and local governments, consumer advocates, providers, insurance
     companies, and most of all, parents, will have to work together to get the job done.
     I will make certain that my administration does everything possible to carry its fair
     share of this burden, and we will do everything in our power to encourage all other
     parties to do the same.


Q:   WILL THE CHILDREN'S INVESTMENT AGREED TO TODAY COVER
     FIVE MILLION CHILDREN?

A:   This is the largest investment in children's health care since the passage of Medicaid
     over three decades ago. We believe that it is sufficient to provide coverage for up to
     five million American children. This $24 billion package has been carefully
     structured to provide meaningful coverage to as many uninsured children as possible.
     Moreover, it contains provisions to ensure that this investment supplements rather
     than replaces existing private or public spending on kid's health.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


Q:   THIS NEW CHILDREN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE IS SCHEDULED TO
     BEGIN OCTOBER 1. IS THIS FEASIBLE?

A:   A number of states will be ready to go quickly, since over 30 states have experience
     with some type of expansion program for children. Others will require more time.
     However, the reactions to this initiative from our nation's governors, children's
     groups, providers, businesses and parents gives me confidence that most states will
     take advantage of this historic opportunity as quickly as possible.


Q:   A RECENT NEW YORK TIMES OP-ED PIECE SUGGESTED THAT THE
     CHILDREN'S INITIATIVE IS NOTHING MORE THAN A LARGE,
     INEFFICIENT PROGRAM THAT WILL CAUSE MASSIVE SUBSTITUTION
     OF PUBLIC COVERAGE FOR PRIVATE COVERAGE. IT ALSO
     SUGGESTS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NOTHING MORE THAN A
     BACK-DOOR WAY TO NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE. DO YOU
     AGREE?

A:   Absolutely not. The article overlooked the many, important provisions designed to
     make this program efficient. There are strong walls between Medicaid, private
     coverage, and the new program so that funds are used only for uninsured children.

     Eligibility is limited to children below 200 percent of poverty except in states that
     have already expanded to that level so higher income children cannot qualifY for
     assistance. States have a great deal of experience in targeting coverage under 150
     percent of poverty ($24,000 for a family offour) without undennining private sector
     coverage. And, for those over 150 percent of poverty, states may charge cost sharing
     which can be designed so that the plan's value does not exceed the value of coverage
     in the private sector. This would guard against any significant employer dropping.

     And, finally, although I remain committed to step-by-step progress toward providing
     affordable coverage to all Americans, the new children's health initiative is not by any
     definition a take over of the health care system. It is a capped, targeted program that
     explicitly creates no entitlement and although the funds are unprecedented, they are
     limited to the dollar amounts written into law.

                                     MEDICARE

Q:   DID YOU GIVE IN ON MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS?

A:   Not at all. I wanted to ensure that Medicare Medical Savings Accounts were a
     demonstration program and that is exactly what I got. I also fought to ensure that
     there are important consumer protections in the package that allow beneficiaries to get
     out of an MSA if they decide soon after that they made a mistake.


Q:   WHY DID YOU AGREE ON INCLUDING A PRIVATE FEE-FOR-SERVICE
     OPTION IN THE FINAL PACKAGE?

A:   As was reported today, we have consistently raised concerns about this provision. In
     fact, we successfully fought for critically important consumer protections. As a
     result, the final provision is quite different from the one that passed the Senate.
     There are now a number of consumer protections such as disclosure requirements and
     other measures that protect beneficiaries from being overcharged by physicians who
     may participate in this program. Specifically, current law balance billing protections
     apply to doctors participating in this type of plan. Doctors will not be allowed to
     charge more than 15 percent over Medicare approved rates. It is worth noting that
     because of the new consumer protections and many other positive provisions in the
     Medicare reform, AARP did not raise objections to this option.


Q:   ARE YOU READY TO DO REAL MEDICARE REFORM IN A
     COMMISSION?

A:   We actually just passed the largest, single reform ofthe Medicare program since it
     was created in 1965. We reformed the managed care payment system, so that
     beneficiaries have greater choices and we are not overpaying plans. We reigned in
     the cost of the remaining fee-for-service providers such as home health agencies. We
     now offer beneficiaries a range of preventive benefits that save costs in the long run.
     And, we crack down on fraud and abuse in the program.

     Despite this enormous accomplishment, we must take the needed, next steps to ensure
     Medicare's life well beyond the decade locked in by the budget bill just enacted. We
     look forward to working with Republicans on the bipartisan Medicare commission.
     This offers the opportunity to thoroughly examine this complex problem and its
     difficult solutions.

Q:   WHO WILL BE ON THE COMMISSION? WHEN WILL YOU DECIDE?

A:   This will be a critically important commission so I am not going to rush into any
     decisions or announcements at this time. In the coming weeks, I will be consulting
     with Congressional Republicans and Democrats to coordinate the set-up of this
     commission to ensure its successful commencement.

     [NOTE: Do not discuss further details until we have information on personnel
     and timing options]



Q:   CONGRESSMAN ARMEY SUGGESTED THAT SENATOR DOLE SHOULD
     CHAIR THE COMMISSION. DO YOU AGREE?

A:   Senator Dole is among the most able leaders this country has seen. He is most
     capable of serving in this role. However, it is premature to discuss any commission
     members at this point.
                               REFORM IN GENERAL               Hex-Dump Conversion



Q:   WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO DO NEXT TO REFORM OUR HEALTH CARE
     SYSTEM?

A:   In December, 1994 I wrote a letter to the Congressional Leadership outlining the next
     steps I wanted to take to improve our health care system. In that letter I said I wanted
     to ensure that health care was accessible to more Americans, that more of our children
     and families obtained affordable health care insurance, that we take steps to
     strengthen and preserve the quality and efficiency in our Medicare and Medicaid
     programs, and that we reduce long term deficits. I am proud that with the enactment
     of this historic balanced budget we have taken significant steps towards achieving all
     of these goals. Last year I signed into law the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation that
     helps families and children keep their health insurance when a family member
     changes or loses a job. This week I have signed into law a balanced budget which
     significantly reduces the deficit, which extends the life of Medicare for at least a
     decade while improving and modernizing the program, and contains the largest
     investment in children's health care since the enactment of Medicaid in 1965.

     I hope that this fall I can work with the Congress to pass new legislation that
     improves quality and ensures adequate consumer protections in the nation's rapidly
     changing health care system. I look forward to working with both Democrats and
     Republicans to that end.


                                      MEDICAID



Q.   IN MEDICAID, WHY DID YOU CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR REWARDS FOR
     THE VERY STATES THAT SCHEMED TO DRIVE UP THE COSTS OF
     THEIR DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE (DSH) SCHEMES?

A:   I agree that so-called high-DSH states should be targeted for higher levels of cuts
     than low-DSH states. All of the plans that I have advocated, including the one
     in the f"mal bill, ensured that this is the case. However, there is also a limit to
     the extent to which the high-DSH states can sustain large reductions without
     excessive pain to the programs and people they serve. We believe that the policy
     we designed with Congress struck an appropriate balance of targeting high-DSH
     states without causing too much disruption.
