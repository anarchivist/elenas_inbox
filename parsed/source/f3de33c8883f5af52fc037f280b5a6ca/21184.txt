TEXT:
According to Earl G. at DOL, he has scheduled the first bi-partisan
working group meeting for Tuesday at 4:30pm.

Also, David Blair (Wyden's staffer) told Earl that one possible substitute
 for their current bill is to develop a program by which undocumented
 farmworkers found to be working in the U.S. are automatically converted to
 H2A workers (and thus receive housing, AEWR, etc.), rather than be
·deported.  Seems not much of an incentive to play by the rules (including
 the rule that requires domestic recruitment prior to accessing the H2A
program) .
