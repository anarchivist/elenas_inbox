That seems quite fair.   The one other important criticism I would make in
the Tone & Message section is that the draft does nothing to change the
terms of the race debate for the 21st Century, which was the whole point
of the race initiative.   It focuses primarily on traditional black-white
issues, instead of the complex new challenges we will face when America is
majority-minority, and it relies on targeted, race-specific programs
instead of universal solutions that expand opportunity for everybody while
helping minorities most.
