TEXT:
I talked to Chiles and Carper's staff. Both are totally behind the Shaw
bill as it is currently and will likely come to DC and stand behind Shaw
at a press conference.  Carper/Chiles claim to have 5 more D Govs--but not
Dean or Romer.  In addition, they heard that there might be some additions
to the bill--like no prevaling wage/minimum wage has to be the max; no
punative damages if somebody takes the state to court; and something about
nothing in the bill should be interpreted as pro-unionization.  It sounded
like Shaw's caucus was starting to add a whole bunch of stuff.

Cynthia and I agree that it will be very difficult to get the Dem Govs to
sign onto compromise language , because this bill is evryithing they ever
wanted. However,they are ready to hear what will are willing to accept.
Perhaps your Tanner/Stenholm call tomorrow will help on strategy.
