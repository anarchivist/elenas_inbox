Q:   What is the Gun-Free Schools Act?

A:   Enacted on October 20, 1994, as part of the Improving America's Schools Act, the
     Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) requires each state receiving Federal funds under the
     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to have in effect a state law requiring
     Local Educational Authorities (LEAs) to expel for aperiod of not less than one year any
     student who is determined to have brought a firearm to school. These policies are more
     commonly referred to as "zero tolerance" gun policies.

Q:   What does the GFSA Report tell us about implementation of the GFSA?

A:   This report provides the first comprehensive information about expulsions under the
     GFSA. With all states now having passed legislation requiring zero tolerance policies,
     the report's primary finding is that of the 51 students million in elementary and secondary
     schools, 6,093 were expelled last year for bringing a firearm to school. Most of these
     were high school students (56%), and most cases involved handguns (58%). Also, most
     of the students expelled (56%) were placed il! an alternate school or placement.

     The GFSA report further breaks down the data by state, school level, type of firearm and
     expulsions that were shortened.

Q:   Does this represent an increase or decrease in expulsions?

A:   It is difficult to compare the estimated number of expulsions last year with this year's
     report. Although we estimated that a similar number of students -- about 6,000 -- were
     expelled for bringing a weapon to school last year, fewer states had submitted data -- and
     the data were also less specific. This year's report is really the first comprehensive
     picture we have of expUlsions under the GFSA.

     Whether expulsions are up or down, however, is much less important than the fact that
     more than 6,000 students bringing a firearm to school is unacceptable. And the more
     detailed information we have about this problem, the better we will be able to address it.

Q:   Do you believe that the GFSA is making our schools safer?

A:   Absolutely. As a result, all of the states have passed and are now enforcing zero
     tolerance polices that have disciplined and/or removed more than 6,000 dangerous
     students from our schools. Zero tolerance for firearms is now an important component
     of school safety throughout the country, and that will make a difference. As the
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

     Superintendent of the Alexandria, Virginia Public Schools recently told the President in a
     White House event, strict enforcement of zero tolerance causes students to change their
     behaviors. In Alexandria, zero tolerance initially resulted in increased suspensions and
     disciplinary actions, but the number of suspendable offenses have now dropped by 40%.

     But we need more than zero tolerance policies to make and keep our schools safe. We
     need more resources for after school programs to keep children safe and supervised.
     And we police, parents and other responsible adults to be involved with their schools.

Q:   What happens to students that are expelled?

A:   The majority of expelled students are being sent to alternate schools, and the number of
     these schools has nearly tripled over the past decade (from 894 to 2,604). However, the
     report seems to indicate that some of these students are not being placed in alternative
     schools, and that is troUbling. The Administration supports the growing movement to
     develop alternative schools, many of which tend to be charter schools.

Q:   Why were some of the expUlsions in the GFSA report shortened?

A:   For one of two reasons: first, the GFSA generally allows the chief educational officer at
     the local level to modify expulsions on a case-by-case basis; and, second, this flexibility
     allows children with disabilities to be disciplined under the provisions of another law --
     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Under the IDEA, disabled
     children may be suspended for not more than 10 school days or removed to an alternative
     setting for up to 45 days.

Q:   The District of Columbia has indicated in the GFSA report that, although it is
     currently implementing its GFSA policy, i.t did not do so during the 1996-1997
     school year_ What does this mean for DC?

A:   The District is currently enforcing the GFSA. In fact, four students have already been
     expelled this year for bringing a firearm to school. Also, the District is currently
     conducting a school-by-school survey to determine whether individual schools expelled
     any students for bringing a firearm to school during the 1996-1997 school year. The
     Department of Education is working closely with the incoming school superintendent,
     Arlene Ackerman, to make sure that the District continues to comply with the GFSA.

Q:   Is DC in danger of losing its funding because of this?

A:   Under the GFSA, any state that does not comply with the GFSA could lose its ESEA
     formula grants funds -- or $31 million in the District's case. We know that the District is
     now enforcing the law. We are beginning an investigation, with the full co-operation of
     the incoming superintendent, to understand why the law was not enforced during the
     1996-1997 school year. We expect to have some preliminary answers within the next 30
     days.
