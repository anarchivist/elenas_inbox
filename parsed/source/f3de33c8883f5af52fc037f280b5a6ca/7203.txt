                         Q&As on Senator Kennedy's Legislation


Q:   What is your reaction to Senator Kennedy's employer mandate legislation that he is
     unveiling today?

A:   First of all, we commend Senator Kennedy for his longstanding commitment to providing
     Americans access to affordable, quality health coverage. He has provided absolutely
     essential leadership on important health care achievements, including the
     Kennedy-Kassebaum and children's health laws. We look forward to continuing to work
     with Senator Kennedy and others on both sides of the aisle in improving our health care
     system. However, our primary focus this year is and must be on passing comprehensive
     tobacco legislation, a patients' bill of rights, and new options for Americans ages 55 to 65
     to buy into Medicare.

Q:   It sounds you are not supporting Senator Kennedy's proposed employer mandate. Is
     that accurate?

A:   This year our health care priorities are passing comprehensive tobacco legislation, a
     patients' bill of rights, as well as new options to for Americans ages 55 to 65 to buy into
     Medicare. We are working with closely Senator Kennedy, the Democratic Leadership,
     and many Republicans on this passing this agenda this year.

Q:   By taking this position are you implicitly or explicitly rejecting an employer
     mandate for expanding coverage?

A:   Weare not implicitly or explicit opposing any proposal that could expand access to
     affordable quality health care for Americans. Once again, however, our priorities for this
     year are passing comprehensive tobacco legislation, a patients' bill of rights, and new
     health insurance options for Americans ages 55 to 65. Pursuing Senator Kennedy's
     legislation this year has the potential to allow others to distract attention from our other
     health care priorities that have a much more realistic chance of passing the Congress.
