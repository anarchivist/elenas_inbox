                                           FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                                                                  JOHN HILLEY



     I.     PURPOSE

           The purpose of this meeting is to (1) set a bipartisan tone with Congress and (2)
     emphasize that tobacco legislation should be a top priority for the coming year.


     11.    BACKGROUND

             The Administration is in a strong position to push tobacco legislation through Congress
     over the next year. Your announcement earlier this month united the public health community
     for the first time and attracted bipartisan support from the nation's attorneys general and many
     members of Congress. The plan you described is simple and clear, and should command
     substantial public support-- and our main adversary, the tobacco industry, should ultimately
     accede to our demands.
             Nevertheless, any tobacco bill will have to make its way through a tangle of overlapping
     committee jurisdictions and agendas. At least six committees in the Senate and four in the
     House can lay claim to some piece of this legislation, and dozens of members in both parties
     have a longstanding interest in tobacco from the standpoint of reducing teen smoking or
     protecting tobacco farmers. Republicans in particular recognize the political potency of the
     President's plan, and are very nervous about being trapped into the appearance of defending the
     industry.
             The first step must therefore be to reassure the leadership and key committee chairs like
     Rep. Bliley that the Administration is indeed serious about passing a bipartisan bill, and not just
     looking to sandbag them in an election year. The meeting with Congressional leaders,
     committee chairs, and ranking members is therefore an important opportunity to set the right tone
     from the outset: you are eager to work together to pass bipartisan legislation as early as possible
     next year, and we are ready to work in a collaborative fashion to get it done.
             Our next step should be for representatives of the Administration, (including Secretary
     Shalala, Secretary Glickman, John Hilley, and Bruce Reed), to meet with the key players in both
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

     parties over the remaining weeks ofthis session, to offer the Administration's expertise and to try
     to marshal bipartisan coalitions in both houses to prepare bills for introduction in January. It is
     too early to tell which members are in the best position to lead that effort. (Bliley is the key
     House Republican, Waxman and Fazio are important House Democrats; Hatch, Lugar, McCain,
     Jeffords, Mack, Campbell and several Republican moderates may be helpful in the Senate;
     Conrad, Lautenberg, Kennedy, and others are strong Senate Democrats). Ideally, we can lay the
     ground work for a center-out coalition in the Senate, along the lines of Hatch-Kennedy or the
     Breaux-Chafee group, and work closely with Bliley, Waxman, and others in the House.
             Senate committees have already held several hearings on tobacco over the past three
     months. Secretary Shalala testified before Jeffords' committee last week. The House may hold
     hearings in November-December· after adjoumment.
             The goal should be to forge a bipartisan vehicle you can endorse in January, and to make
     that the central focus of next years' State ofthe Union.
             Opponents of the legislation will make three types of arguments to slow it down. First,
     Nickles and others have criticized the Administration for failing to submit full legislative
     language to Congress and blamed the Administration for any delay in passage of a bill. Second,
     some will use the complexity ofthe issue as an excuse to go slow, eventually permitting perhaps
     only restricted portions of a bill to advance following lengthy hearings. Finally, opponents of
     legislation may focus on flashpoints such as farmers, restrictions on class action suits, or legal
     fees.
             The Administration has a number of arguments to deploy in response to these expected
     attacks. The strongest argument is to raise above partisan bickering, and stress the urgency of
     solutions that will protect America's children. In addition, you have a strong history of
     leadership on smoking issues and can draw upon public support in future disagreements with
     Congress.

            To be Added.


     IV.    PRESS PLAN

            The meeting is closed to the press. The members of Congress will have an opportunity
     to meet the press outside the White House following the event.

     VI.    REMARKS


     WELCOME
     *        I want to welcome all of you to the White House, and thank you for coming to talk about
     this vital issue for America's future. (Acknowledge 4 senior members of Senate, and House by
     name.) This is an issue that touches on many aspects of American life-- our health, our
     economy, our laws, and our children-- and I want to acknowledge the hard work of so many of
     you in this room on this issue. In particular, I want to thank the Vice-president for his very
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
    important contribution work. You are all here because of the critical role you will playas we
    work to pass legislation together. It is complicated, but I'm confident we can put politics aside
    and get this done.

     PURPOSE
    *        You and I are here because this is a crucial issue for America's future. Three thousand
    kids start smoking everyday, it shortens the lives of one thousand of them. As I've said before,
    this is not about money, and it shouldn't be about politics. It should be about trying to reduce
    this problem of youth smoking.

    *       Two weeks ago, I outlined the most significant elements I thought should be contained in
    a bill. First, that we should reduce teen smoking with tougher penalties, that we shouldn't
    hamstring FDA authority to regulate tobacco, that there should be some changes in the way
    tobacco is marketed, that we need to make more progress on other health goals like second hand
    smoke. Finally, and this is very important to me, we need to protect farmers and their
    communities. This bill can't devastate those communities. They must be protected.

    TIMING GOALS

    *      This is very important to me, I'm going to put it at the top of my agenda for the next year,
    and I hope you will join me.


    WORKING TOGETHER

    *        This bill will go through many committees and it affects many people and many states.
    It is not going to happen by fiat, but after you hold hearings, and work through the difficulties of
    legislation. And I'm sure we will have our differences. But this is too important for us not to
    get done. And it can't wait until we all agree on every word. We should work together and try
    to move ahead.

    *      I've put out my principles. What I think should be a new law. I'm pledging the
    Administration to provide whatever technical support, drafting support, we can, as you attempt to
    do you job and put this into legislative language.

    * But I asked you here not just to tell you what I think about the issue but to hear what you
    think-- how we can work together, how we can get this done. So I'll ask Vice-President Gore to
    give some of his thoughts, and I'd like to hear what directions you are going to take on tobacco
    legislation, where the problems might be and how we can work together.




                                  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             H~,"\=Dump Conversion
     Q. Why don't you submit legislation on tobacco?
     A. I'm happy to be of whatever technical help I can be in helping Congress draft legislation. I
     don't think there is any doubt where I stand. The five principles I set out are very clear. There is
     an argument both ways on whether submitting legislation would make this a more efficient
     bi-partisan enterprise or not. It didn't seem to work on health care. I am not about playing the
     blame game here. I think members should introduce legislation, hold hearings and move for·
     votes and I will playas constructive a role as possible.


     Q. When should a bill pass?
     A. It is at the top of my agenda for this year. There is nothing more important than saving
     thousands of children from taking up smoking. Three thousand are starting everyday.

     Q.   Will negotiations include industry?
     A.   The industry is a piece of this, but there isn't a need to negotiate with them.

     Q. What is the role of the VPOTUS?
     A. VPOTUS will take a leadership role in the legislation.
