Q.    What do racial incidents like the recent occurrence in Jasper say about the success
      of the Initiative and the state of race in this country?

A.     Thisjirst answer is being drafted by the PIR, but they would like our answer to the
      follow-up.                                .

Q.    What role should the federal government play in addressing these kinds of
      incidents?

A.    The federal government must continue to playa leadership role in stamping out
      race-based hate and race-based crimes, through strict enforcement of our criminal and
      civil rights laws (including laws against hate crimes). In addition, all Americans -- not
      just government officials -- need to continue to speak out against hate, prejudice and
      senseless violence.

Q.    Aren't opportunities in this country limited more by class than by race? Thus,
      shouldn't class-based policies be our focus?

A.    America is moving closer to fulfilling its fundamental promise of equality and the
      opportunity for advancement for all. I have worked to restore the American dreamby
      expanding the economy, investing in education for all children and making all of our
      communities safer. However, I recognize that while many of the challenges that we face
      are linked to issues of class, wealth and income, many others are rooted in racial and
      ethnic prejudices, both old and new. That is why we must focus both on creating better
      opportunities for all Americans in education, employment and economic opportunity and
      on developing and strengthening policies that are targeted to eliminating racial
      discrimination and racial disparities, such as increased enforcement of our civil rights
      laws and my initiative to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities.

Q.    How do we get past our racial problems, when the Federal government relies so
      heavily on the use of racial classifications?

A.     Though our progress in bridging the racial divide in this country has been significant over
       the past 30 years, we don't yet live Dr. King's dream of all Americans being judged by
       the' content of their character, rather than the color of their skin. As long as racial and/or
       ethnic categories have currency in our democracy -- where we still see strong evidence
     . of race-based housing and employment discrimination and large racial and ethnic
       disparities in health and college enrollment statistics -- the federal government must be
       able to both identify where race does playa role and target its efforts to close those gaps.

    Q.   The issue of school choice has a racial impact -- more white students are able to
         afford and attend private schools while more students of color are stuck in
         low-performing public schools, especially in urban areas. Why not support full
         school choice (i.e., public, private, and parochial) to allow minority children to move
         into better schools?

    A.   The best way to ensure that all children have access to a quality education in America is
         to focus on strengthening the public schools -- where 90% of our children are educated --
         and expanding choice within the public education system, such as through charter
         schools. Vouchers would diminish the country's commitment to public education by
         siphoning critical dollars from neighborhood public schools that are already short on
         resources in order to send a few selected students to private schools. They would distract
         attention from the hard work of reform needed to change failing schools into good
         schools and good schools into outstanding schools.

         Public schools face a host of challenges, but the answer is to put competition, change,
         excellence, and accountability back into the public school system, not to take limited
         funds away from it. No child in America -- black or white; rich or poor -- deserves a
         second class education.
