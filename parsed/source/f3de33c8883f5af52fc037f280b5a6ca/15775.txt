TEXT:
I am e-mailing two different drafts of this Executive Order.   I've been
struggling over whether or not we need to create just the Advisory Board
by e.o. or the whole initiative, along with the Executive Director
position.  So, this first draft comprises the entire initative with the
two parts being the Advisory Board and Executive Director.   The second
draft I'll e-mail establishes just the Advisory Board, but sticks in the
Executive Director who, as a federal officer, will need to call the
meetings.  (Unless we want the President to call the meetings, in which
case we can add a para. stating this.)

I need your advise as to which you think is the best way to go as well as
comments on the e.o. itself.   Thanks.
