I'm almost done with DoJ's and FTC's edits to the Q & A, which I will send
in a minute. Here is the one pager.   I filled it up, so I don't know if
we still need the para. on the national campaign that includes accomps
over the last few weeks -- Bruce had suggested it before we had the
challenge.

           PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW STUDY TO EXAMINE
              THE MARKETING OF VIOLENT MEDIA TO CHILDREN
                               June 1, 1999

Continuing his efforts to promote a culture that values children, rather than a culture of violence,
the President announced that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice will
conduct a study of the marketing practices of entertainment industries to determine whether they
are marketing violent material, that is rated for adults, to children. As part of a Rose Garden
event, in which he was joined by the First Lady, the President also challenged retailers to enforce
the age restrictions on adult-oriented media to better ensure that inappropriate material is kept out
of the hands of children.

Helping Parents to Make the Right Choices for Their Children. Too often today children are
exposed to images that glamorize violence and desensitize children to it. Numerous studies have
shown that this kind of violent programming increases children's aggression towards others and
desensitizes them to violence. While the movie, recording, and video game industries all use
content-based ratings systems, the ratings are undermined if these industries market violent
materials, rated for adults, to children. And these practices make it harder for parents to control
the movies, music and games to which their children are exposed. To help address this problem,
President Clinton today announced that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of
Justice will conduct a study on the marketing practices of the motion picture, recording, and
video game industries with regard to material rated for adults, to determine whether and to what
extent these industries market such material to children. The study will examine whether these
materials are designed to attract children to violent materials and whether sectors of these
industries target children by advertising violent material rated for adults in media outlets in
which children comprise a substantial percentage of the audience. The study will also examine
whether these industries have adopted procedures restricting the sale of products rated for adults
to children and the extent to which they monitor and encourage compliance with those provisions
by retailers. [FTC plans to do this last sentence, but Justice did not sign off on it. I just wanted
to put it in so you could see.]

Challenging Entertainment Industry Distributors to Enforce Ratings. A key to shielding
children from exposure to excessively violent media is to halt their access to these products at the
point of sale. Too many children can purchase or rent violent video games and films intended for
adults from retailers who do not check identifications. In fact, according to a study conducted
last year by the National Institute on the Media and the Family, 41 % of retail clerks do not
understand the video game rating system. In addition, the study surveyed fourth through eighth
graders, and found that half named violent games as their favorites. It also found that while
video stores accounted for $800 million in game revenues last year, only 9% of them refused to
rent mature titles to minors. Nevertheless, some communities are trying new and innovative
ways to address this problem. For example, in the state of Washington, the Washington Retail
Association is taking steps to curb children's access to violent video games by promoting an
educational campaign to inform purchasers of the video-game rating system at businesses that
sell or rent video games and working with the Interactive Digital Software Association to create a
point-of-sale system that will notify and remind clerks to ask for identification from buyers.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

Because the President believes that it is wrong for any child with the right amount of money to be
able to simply buy the most violent video game or rent the most violent movies, he issued a
challenge today to the nation's retailers to follow Washington's model and enforce the ratings
systems when they sell or rent any rated material to children.

Advancing an Agenda to Address Youth Violence. In an effort to comprehensively address
the factors that lead to youth violence, the Clinton Administration has developed and supported
initiatives that address these issues in multi-faceted ways. In response to the recent, tragic
schools shootings the President Clinton launched a national campaign to prevent youth violence
which will work with all sectors of our society - the media, education groups, parents, religious
leaders, and young people - to focus on this problem, find what's working and spread it to new
communities, while helping to ensure that the media sends the right message to our children ..
The central principle of this campaign is that to make progress against youth violence requires
that everyone take responsibility. Parents have a duty to stay involved in their children's lives as
they grow older and more independent. The federal government should take responsibility to
keep guns out of the hands of children, by ending the ending the deadly gun-show loophole and
through other means. And the entertainment industry must do its part to help us as a nation end
the culture of violence that particularly affects the most vulnerable of children.
