TEXT:
It sounds like the governors are getting a bit nervous that they won't get
their recoupment waiver in the supplemental appropriations bill.
Yesterday, Carper's guy (Jonathan Jones) wanted to know from me if we were
still open to working this out in the appropriations bill (rather than
just stripping it out) and he suggested we should signal that to the GOP
appropriators who would then put pressure on the GOP governors.  And I
understand (though not from Chris) that Ray Scheppach raised the issue
with Chris and wants to come in and meet with Bruce later this week.
Chris can you tell us more?
