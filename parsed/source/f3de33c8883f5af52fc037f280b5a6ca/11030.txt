TEXT:
BR/EK:

Based on my conversation w/BR today, Karen and I pitched the following for
bringing some juice to the Monday announcement.   Unfortunately, I
understand that Ann reacted badly to our suggestion about making the event
about young Hollywood types.  I'm still scraping the bottom of the policy
barrel to see if there isn't any other news hook for Monday (reports,
money laundering, etc.), but I'm not too hopeful.    Frankly, none of the
other drug policy stuff will be as interesting to the media as their own
role in the drug fight (i.e., increased funds for capacity expansion
grants vs. Buffy the Vampire Slayer ... no contest).

Do you folks want to revisit our suggestion w/Doug and others at senior
staff? ONDCP actually likes the media idea, and I understand Doug isn't
pleased with the lack of news.

Subject:         ONDCP Drug Strategy Event

I know that people are currently considering how to bring some focus to
ONDCP's Drug Strategy release on Monday.  DPC would like to suggest that
we consider highlighting the private sector contributions to the
President's media campaign. Specifically, we could invite several young
actors from the WB network, and have one of them speak.  Several shows on
the WB network -- including Dawson's Creek, The Wayans Brothers, The Smart
Guy, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Hyperion Bay -- have done either
original programming or original PSAs on the drug issue, meeting the


 President's challenge to the private sector to join in the media
 campaign. Another link to the WB network is the young woman in our
 "frying pan" PSA, Rachel Leigh Cook.  She now has a role on Dawson's Creek
 and is also featured in the new movie "She's All That."   We could also
 show a clip from one of the anti-drug episodes. ONDCP has a tape from the
 recent Wayan's Brothers program that they can bring over.

 For his part, the President could use his speech to highlight how the WB
 network and others have contributed to our efforts (PSAs, web pages, new
 programming, etc.), and how this commitment is part of the reason that,
 for the second year in a row, we're seeing adolescent drug use level off
 or decline.

 Please let us know if people would like to go this route.   Thanks.
