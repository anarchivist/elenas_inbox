Elena:

I forgot to mention yesterday that Sylvia would like for your/DPC to pull
together a meeting/dialogue with all the key folks -c including
speechwriting and communications -- to help coach the race gang on how we
speak to the minority enrollment issue.  Towards the end of yesterday's
meeting, we weren't all on the same page on how we should comment on the
numbers.  For instance, Sylvia thought it was more important to focus on
the overall fall in minority applications, while Diane (?, Counsel's
Office) and others thought we should point out that we don't all start
from "equal footing," and that SATs, etc., should be challenged as the
primary factor in college admissions.
