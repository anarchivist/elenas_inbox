TEXT:
In case you missed it, GOP's:

   Said that all programs would be block granted through states to
districts, except Title I, for which the only change is that 95% has to
go to the classroom -- and said governors accept that.   It wasn't
entirely clear if they meant to include special ed -- they claimed not to
have a list of covered programs.  Only program specified was Goals 2000.
Said that states would still specify criteria.

   Now claims that there are 788 federal education programs (up from 760).

   Denied that they favor comprehensive testing of teachers, but
confusingly said that their legislation just provides incentives/removes
any limitations on using federal funds to do that. When asked, they
didn't know if there were any limitations to begin with.  Emphasized that
testing is not mandated in their proposal.

-- On a question about national testing and the National Association of
Manufacturers, Lott said he though that Congress could reach some kind 0 f
agreement with Admin on national tests, but then said tests should be
determined by teachers and parents at the local level, not bureaucrats,
that what was needed was more flexibility in how tests were developed and
administered, that folks would keep moving forward on this.

-- When pressed on the problem of being able to compare existing tests,
Coverdell replied with irritation how do you think we determined that 4
out of 10 haven't passed basic skills [the answer, of course, is a
national test    NAEP).  Said we didn't want to be dumbing down and didn't
want teachers to teach to a test of a national curriculum.


     -- On the Coverdell K-12 IRA, Lott said that 'he had reason to believe
     that the Administration was beginning to see the wisdom of the proposal'
     and that Admin will eventually go along with that.

     -- Lott said he expected we should be able to work together on charter
     schools, reading, and work study, but emphasized that we can't break the
     budget caps.

     Currently ED is not planning on doing a statement, but they will use our
     talking points, and also have provided some of the language to Dascle's
     office, who is doing a statement.

     - - Bill
