TEXT:
FYI. The EEOC survived the full committee mark-up with an unchanged $18.5
million increase and no riders re: testing.  There was, however, a motion
to reduce the EEOC's budget by $2 million by Rep. Dickey. He was
apparently upset about some high profile case in Arkansas, and spoke about
it at length. That started a discussion of lots of disliked EEOC cases by
various Rep. members. According to Martha, Livingston then indicated that
they had a deal with the EEOC and that neither he nor Rogers was support
ing the reduction in funding.  Dixon and Mollohan also spoke about the
agency's need for increased funding.  The motion failed on a vote of 37 to
11. EEOC is now in the process of transmitting a signed version of the
letter to the various Chairs and ranking members. Martha indictated that
either she or Larry Stein would call Gingrich to confirm his support to
beat back similar motions when the bill gets to the floor.
