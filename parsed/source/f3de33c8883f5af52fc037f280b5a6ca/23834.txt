Disney Pulls Video Games From Park

                            ANAHEIM, Calif.    (AP) -- Disneyland is pulling
the plug on 30
                            violent video arcade games in the amusement park
and two
                            Disney-owned hotels in response to the school
massacre in
                            Colorado.

                            All of the games were to be unplugged by Friday
and then
                            removed by a vendor, the park said. Disneyland
did not
                            provide a list of titles.

                            The new policy distinguishes between games in
which humans
                            are targets and those that are simple accuracy
contests.

                            "We just don't think there's any place for
violent video games
                            at Disneyland, "   park spokesman Ray Gomez said.
"This has
                            probably been under consideration for a while,
but the events in


                    April brought it to the forefront of our
thinking. ' ,

                    On April 20, two teen-agers at Columbine High in
Littleton,
                    Colo., shot and killed 12 fellow students and a
teacher before
                    committing suicide.
