TEXT:
Rahm/Elena:

        While I'm still pouring over the facts to make sure this is what
makes the most sense, here's my initial recommendation of what we might
want to say in the radio address:

1.      Add section on preventing/responding to multiple shootings in annual
report.  Building on his comments this morning the President could calIon
the AG and Secretary Riley to convene a national meeting with experts on
what leads youth to commit such sudden, violent acts (child abuse,
exposure to violence, etc.). Recommendations from the experts would be
added to the Administration's Annual Report on School Safety and include
early warning signs and initial responses that teachers and parents should
know to help avoid multiple shootings by distraught students.

2.      Make parents who don't keep guns out of the hands of their kids liable
for their actions.  In both the Pearl and Paducah shootings, the kids
involved obtained their firearms from their homes.  There is absolutely no
reason that a distraught 11- or 12-year old should have easy and
unsupervised access to firearms.  That's why parents who donD,t make the
effort to safely store and lock their firearms should be held liable for
their actions. Next week, the Administration will transmit model juvenile
handgun legislation to the States that -- in addition to many of the
provisions in our juvenile crime bill -- will propose making adults who
allow easy to their firearms criminally liable if those guns are misused.
Not only should states enact those laws, but I will ask the AG to
determine if we should enact such legislation at the federal level, too.

Rahm, the draft report and legislation on model handgun legislation has
not yet been sent
and can be leaked.  I'll run a copy over to you in a few minutes.  DOJ and
Education
refuse to budge on the other pending school violence study. You may want
to call Kent.
Also, did you know that Riley is testifying on the Hill this afternoon,
and this is sure to
come up. I understand that ABC will cover the hearing.

Jose'
