TEXT:
Bruce, Elena, Michael, et.al.:

Below are my recommendations on how to approach clearing the provisions of
the President's proposed crime bill by 3/31 -- our target date for a
Presidential event. Apologies in advance to OMB for all the work that
this will entail, but we here at DPC -- as I'm sure you know -- are
committed to work with you every step of the way to get this done.

1.  Immediately circulate old/amended proposals. We should immediately
circulate those proposals that have either already been cleared, or that
have been revised slightly since last year.  I would suggest a due date of
Friday, 3/19. These proposals include:

- Title IV, Subtitles C (drugs), D (Brady/gun shows) and E (money
laundering) ;
- All of Title V (juvenile crime); and
- Title VI (international crime), except for Subtitle H (chem-bio).

2. Circulate new/additional proposals on Monday (3/8). Before we
circulate some of the newer -- and possibly newsworthy -- proposals, I
would like to have a few days to run them by senior White House staff
before they are broadly circulated.  These include:

- All of Title III {VAWA, health care/telemarketing/pension fraud,


environmental crimes);
- Title VI, Subtitle H (chem-bio);
- All of Title VII (miscellaneous federal law enforcement, including
McDade repeal); and
- All of Title VIII (mysterious, unscrutinized "criminal law
improvements") .

If WH folks are fine with these proposals, we should circulate by COB
Monday and, I suggest, ask for comments by 3/19.  If not, we may need to
amend these provisions before circulating, or perhaps drop them entirely.

3.  Expedited/limited review of Presidential Priorities. The provisions
of the bill authorizing the President's COPS, drug testing, and gun
proposals need to be run by the law enforcement groups, mayors, and key
Hill staff before they're finalized.  Not only will we need more time to
do this, but we also will not want to circulate these proposals too
broadly or for too long a period.  I would suggest that DPC -- working
closely w/OMB, DOJ and Treasury -- have until 3/19 to finalize these
proposals.  This would allow OMB the entire week of.3/22 to conduct an
expedited, though more limited, clearance process. The provisions
eligible for this expedited review would include:

- All of Title I and II (actually we will propose combining these into one
title) ;
- Title IV, Subtitle A (zero tolerance drug supervision); and
- Title IV, Subtitles F, G, H, I and J (miscellaneous gun provisions) .

4.  Expedite review of miscellaneous provisions during the week of 3/22.
Before introducing the crime bill, we want to make sure we have fully
considered incorporating any and all provisions that are important to us,
key Members of Congress, and important constituency groups. As a result,
we are putting together a table of potential crime bill provisions that
merit one last look before the President's bill is finalized; we should
half a first draft next week. Although I don't expect us to consider any
particularly controversial issues in this context, we should allow some ti
me for a final vet of any last-minute add-ons we may want to consider.   I
would propose that, as with the President's key priorities, any such
proposals be considered the week of 3/22 on an expedited basis.

Comments, thoughts ...
