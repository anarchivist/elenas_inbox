TEXT:
I talked to Mike about the Times article on bad teachers.  We agreed that
we should hold a Presidential forum on how to help communities deal with
bad teachers (maybe using the Jim Hunt event in October?)  We could
release a survey of community efforts so far, and have a roundtable with a
few success stories, the heads of AFT and NEA, etc.

Can you guys work on this?
