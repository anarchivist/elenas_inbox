MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:       Meeting with Representative Waxman

Representative Waxman has requested this meeting to discuss Federal recoupment of Medicaid
revenues. As you recently told Governor Chiles, we would relinquish our claim to state tobacco
recoveries in exchange for the states agreeing to use half their money on the menu of seven items
that we negotiated with the NGA as part of the McCain legislation (child care, child welfare, the
maternal and child health block grant, the substance abuse block grant, the safe and drug free
schools program, Eisenhower education grants, and the state match for the children's health
insurance program). We oppose the NGA's current proposal to eliminate our claims outright,
allowing the states to use their funds in an umestricted manner. While it seems unlikely that this
issue will be resolved this year -- and we are not actively seeking a resolution at this time -- we
do want to ensure that Senator Hutchison does not succeed in adding an appropriations rider
codifying the NGA proposal.

Waxman objects to any attempt to resolve the issue this year, because he believes that any such
resolution would deter passage of comprehensive tobacco reform next term. If something has to
be done this year, however, Waxman is likely to prefer the position of the public health groups,
who are calling for 20 percent of the federal portion of the settlement funds to be spent on
tobacco control. Thus, they want 50 percent of the funds for umestricted purposes, and 40
percent for the state menu, and 10 percent for tobacco control. Waxman's staff told us that they
believe it is important to reserve funds from the state settlements for federal tobacco control
initiatives, in case the state settlement gives Congress less of an incentive to pass comprehensive
reform next year. It is worth noting that an equally, if not more compelling, argument can be
made that funds used for this purpose may provide a greater disincentive for the passage of
comprehensive reform, because Republicans will claim that we already have passed a bill.

Your goals for this meeting should be to convey:
   (1) we are not actively pursuing a resolution to this issue;
   (2) we will not support any resolution unless it includes, at a minimum, a range of
   Democratic priorities that are agreeable to all of us;
    (3) while we understand Waxman's argument in support of reserving federal funds for
    tobacco control, we question whether it could actually diminish the momentum necessary to
   pass comprehensive reforms; and
   (4) to the extent that there is any federal recoupment, Congress may not spend the money on
   Democratic priorities, so we believe it is best to require states to spend all of funds in the
   manner that we negotiated with the NGA.
