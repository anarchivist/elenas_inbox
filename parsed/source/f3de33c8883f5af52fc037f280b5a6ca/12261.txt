The Ed letter isn't going to do the trick.  Your suggestion sounds fine,
but quite honestly, so long as Justice is where Justice is on this issue,
Tracy is going to have a hard time just making it go away.

Subject: Charter Schools/Bill Lan Lee

I have been asked to participate in a conference call today, Friday at 4pm
on Bill Lan Lee and need your advice.

After our meeting on charter schools earlier this week, Tracey Thornton
called me to inform me that Senator Hatch and other folks have linked the
charter schools issue with Bill Lan Lee's nomination and they feel they
need a letter or some document that separates this issue from his
nomination asap.

I explained toTracey that Education is drafting a letter that addresses
the larger issue of civil rights and schools. Tracey thought that would
be fine, however upon further reflection, I am not sure if this Education
letter is really the kind of response that will separate the issue from


Bill's nomination.   It may make more sense for someone else - preferably
with credibility in both the charter school and civil rights arenas - send
a letter that separates this issue from Bill's nomination. Of course, we
should provide policy directions but the letter could be similar to the
general letter that White House Counsel's office drafted last month that
indicates that the Administration supports both charter schools and civil
rights.

Please let me know what you think.   Thanks.
