TEXT:
The meeting with Andie went as expected.  She was reluctant but finally
agreed to set up a Child Care Task Force as part of the Democratic Caucus
that will rally behind child care principles, do events, raise awareness,
etc.

One other thing. Helen Blank called about a Democratic alternative budget
resolution that is being prepared that does not include child care.  I
talked to Barbara Chow and Martha Foley but neither of them know anything
about it. Do you?
