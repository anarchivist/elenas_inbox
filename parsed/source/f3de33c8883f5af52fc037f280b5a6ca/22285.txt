TEXT:
FYI -- Looks like we got some help from the First Lady's office in trying
to get a date for this.  It's not totally confirmed, but we have at least
a tentative date.

Chris -- Please let me know if you think there will be any problems with
this date.  Note that this is the day after the end of the NGA conference
here in DC.

Per a phone conversation between Stephanie and Patti Solis-Doyle, we are
tentatively holding Tuesday, February 23rd for the long awaited CHIP
announcement. This is one of the only days that is still open and that
both the President and First Lady are both here.

We will bring this up at the next message meeting.
