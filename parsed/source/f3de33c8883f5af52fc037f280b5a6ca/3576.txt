 TEXT:
 Stein's memo suggests several administrative actions SSA could take to
 make it more likely that families take advantage of their appeal rights.
 These include calling families, particularly those who are appealing but
 not exercising their right to have benefits continue during the appeal;
 telling families how to get pro bono legal services; allow more "good
 cause" extensions to the appeals deadlines; giving state agencies the
 names of those cut off so they can assist them.

 Some of these sound like good ideas, but they are clearly the types of
 things that SSA should make the calIon. So we think we need to ask them
 what they think.  I can call them if you want.

 In terms of a formal response to Stein, we are simply cc'd, so originally
 I didn't think we needed to respond. But Sylvia's note suggests perhaps
 we should.    If SSA takes some of these actions, I'm not crazy about
 taking credit for them and undercutting SSA, since among other things that
 will encourage him to come to us for help.    If you were looking for
 something symbolic, we could make a more formal request of SSA to evaluate
 these ideas ....

 In my experience, pushing SSA a bit to look at suggestions like this can
 be productive.

 Did you get a copy of the Jonathan Stein memo?   What do you think we
 should do to respond?
