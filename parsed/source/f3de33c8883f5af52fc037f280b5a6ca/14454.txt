TEXT:
           Gov. Lowry has made an interesting request of USDA that they want
           to reject tomorrow at noon.  He has asked USDA to sell him food
           stamps for legal immigrants who are losing eligibility, and he
           promises to reimburse USDA for the cost.  His theory is that this
           is easier than establishing some new state voucher for this
           purpose.

           USDA is pretty convinced that this is legally an impossibility.
           They think the only hope is legislation IF we want to do this
           policy-wise - - which they're not sure they want to do.

           Questions for us:  Is this something we would want to do?
           Politically, we have clearly pushed to soften the impact and
offer
           states flexibility; but do we want to get into the business of
           selling food stamps to all kinds of comers? They are federal
food
           stamps, and these immigrants are not supposed to get them ....

           If we do like this idea, do we want to take a look at USDA's
legal
           analysis that led them to conclude that this can't be done
without
           legislation?

           To make matters worse,   Lowry wants an answer from Glickman by
noon
           tomorrow -- I think because he is leaving office, with the new
           Gov. coming in?!? The new Gov. apparently favors this, but would
           ra ther it were a Lowry proposal.

           I will try to learn more about the logistics, but let me know of
           any reactions on the policy.
