Subject: Editorial:. Call off the war on gays

U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, August 3, 1998

BY D~VID GERGEN / EDITOR AT LARGE
Call off the war on gays
Conservative attacks on homosexuals ignore a basic Christian message
     Why so many Republicans and leaders of the religious right have joined
in
  denunciations of gays this summer is almost as mysterious as homosexuality
  itself. No doubt, the conservatives are sincere in their convictions and,
in
  some cases, see gay-bashing as a way to mobilize their electoral base. But
  they must realize that inflammatory attacks will also drive away many othe
r
  Americans who have made peace with this issue and will incite new
outbreaks of
  prejudice--and possibly violence--that contradict the Christian message of
  love and reconciliation.
     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott touched off the storm this June when
he
  said homosexuality is a sin and compared it to alcoholism, kleptomania,
and
  sexual addiction. Republican Sen. James Inhofe has likened a gay
businessman,
  nominated for an ambassadorship, to David Duke of Ku Klux Klan infamy.
After
  the GOP in Texas barred gay Republicans from passing out information at a
  state convention, a party spokesman made the same odious comparison,
saying
  they were a hate group like the Klan. Meanwhile, the Rev. Pat Robertson
warned
  the city of Orlando that its support for a gay-pride celebration was
inviting
  the vengeance of God and later pointed to the fires in Florida as an
example
  of holy punishment.
     Affirm, not attack. Fortunately, not all conservatives agree. Ralph
Reed
  says Republicans have "tripped over their own shoelaces." He learned from


his
 experience as head of the Christian Coalition that a positive affirmation
of
 values--morality, traditional marriage, tolerance--rallies the faithful
far
 more effectively than bitter, divisive attacks. Yet his wisdom goes
unheeded.
 Some 15 conservative organizations have recently begun purchasing
full-page
 advertisements in major newspapers, saying that homosexuality is not just
a
    sin but a mental disease, a view rejected by the mental health community
25
 years ago.
     Some conservatives are now carrying such views into the political
arena.
 The Senate refuses to consider the nomination of gay businessman, James
 Hormel, to become the ambassador to Luxembourg. In the House, Rep. Joel
Hefley
 of Colorado is spearheading efforts to overturn President Clinton's
executive
 order banning discrimination against gays in federal hiring. There is also
 conservative talk of applying a litmus test to Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas,
 demanding that he oppose gays in the party if he wants support for a
 presidential run.
     On one basic point, conservatives are right: A great many Americans
feel
 uncomfortable when asked by gay activists to go beyond quiet acceptance of
 homosexuality to policies that seem to promote it. Polls show, for
example,
 that most people want an end to discrimination against gays in the
workplace
 but balk at same-sex marriages. Nor do most parents want kids coming home
from
 school believing that gay is "cool," and that experimentation with gay
sex is
 trendy.
     There is, then, a legitimate cause for an open, respectful dialogue, as
 some conservatives want, but there is no justification for derogatory
attacks,
 as when a pastor in South Carolina recently called gays "a stench in the
 nostrils of God." These assaults are a transparent attempt to shove gays
back
 in the closet, stripping them of their rights and dignity. As the Rev.
Peter
 Gomes of Harvard points out, we have learned that when leaders foster a
 climate of prejudice, as in the days of Jim Crow, they give cultural
 "permission" to less scrupulous followers to inflict violence upon their
 targets.
     Christian conservatives have made many contributions in recent years,
 trying to rebuild marriage, strengthen men through the Promise Keepers,
and
 clean up Hollywood entertainment. But they should call off this divisive
war
 on gays. The same Bible from which one can pluck passages condemning
 homosexuality contains other passages that approve the subjugation of
women,
 the enslavement of blacks, and the exclusion of Jews from heaven. Western
 society has rightly abandoned mean spiritedness and arrogance toward
   "

 minorities in favor of the Christian message of love and equality before
God.
 Let God, not man, judge those who walk a different path.
