     TEXT:
     Following our meeting on the Hill with the House Appropriators I called
     INS (Weber- Budget) to relay to him our concerns about the need for
     pricing information and the organizational relationship with the Border
     Patrol.

     Border Patrol -- The Commissioner has told Reyes that the Border Patrol
     will have this separate, special reporting relationship and a Border
     Patrol chief "responsible" for the Border Patrol.  I told him our
     understanding, based on what the Commissioner said last week, was that all
     local enforcement officers had a clear chain of command through local
     units, to the area enforcement director, to the EAC for enforcement.   I
     told him that the Border Patrol reporting structure that Alan outlined
     tonight blows a sizable hole in our "chain of command" argument.

     Pricing -  I also told him that we needed to work with INS to corne up with
     a best estimate on pricing the restructuring out in FY 99 and possible
     cost areas as the restructuring moves forward into 2000 by Friday.   He
     said that he was uncomfortable with developing any estimate given the lack
     of specificity in the restructuring at this time.  He thought Hill staff
     agreed that pricing data could be developed over the Spring/Summer as the
     restructuring is finalized and moves forward.  I said that the
     Commissioner and the Administration would look foolish if on Tuesday we
     didn't have any answer on possible costs of the restructuring if the
     Chairman asks (especially since he has CBO pricing out CIR). He also said
     that the Commissioner is still talking about law enforcement pay for INS
     inspectors (I told both Weber and the Commissioner's staff that the only
     pay issue she should speak about was the Customs/INS pay comparability
     proposal which the Department had forwarded to OMB) -- which is the
     possible BIG future cost.

     He said someone would have to call the Commissioner to get this kind of
     pricing data and his response would be they couldn't do it by Friday.

     Either Michael or Elana needs to talk to the Commissioner to clear up
     these issues -- or at least get an acceptable answer that the
     Administration feels comfortable with when she testifies next week and


Rogers raised these issue.   I don't know, maybe the eIR was right --
kidding.
