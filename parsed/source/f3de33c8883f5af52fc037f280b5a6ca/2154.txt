    You got a somewhat nutty note on this issue that you probably found
    totally perplexing -- to you, Kamarck, me, and a bunch of people from
    Education.  Here is my effort to begin to sort it out -- i.e., you
    shouldn't have to take any action.

    Several of us just got a fairly baffling memo from Judy Heumann/Howard
    Moses of the Education Dept. about a "Section 508" issue.  It is a bit of
    a mess, so I will do my limited best to summarize what is going on.

    Section 508 is part of a 20-year-old law (the Rehab Act).  It requires
    that federal computer purchases be accessible. A group of federal
    appointees with disabilities, led by Howard Moses of Education, has been
    arguing for months that the Administration (OMB) has not done nearly
    enough to make sure that agencies are living up to this.

    Now there is a bill from Rep. Eshoo that may get added to a larger
    workforce bill.  It would mandate that OMB has some role in all this -- I
    think to certify that agencies were complying.  The Education Dept's memo
    proposes that we support the bill, and it cc's all the most prominent
    disability advocates in the administration, including those at the
    National Council on Disability, who are not entirely internal to the
    Administration.

    It seems very odd to me that we would support a bill that requires us to
    enforce an existing law.  I have told Education this, but they will push
    hard that it is the only way to get OMB to take any action.  It seems like
    we ought to be able to satisfy them without supporting a change in the law.
