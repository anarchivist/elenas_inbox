Just a quick update
Meetings this week:   Implementation subgroup today at 3:00;
intergovernmental meeting tomorrow at 1:00.
Items on our plate here at the WH:
(1) Steve/Diana/Elena -- the one page memo from USDA on the April
1 date's impact on noncitizens -- Steve: can you consolidate
comments from Diana and Elena and call Yvette this morning?
 (2) 18-50 guidance -- Ken, I know you are briefing Raines today.
My sense is we could use a WH meeting on this topic.   Does that
sound right to everyone. We need to give reaction to USDA.
Please advise.
 (3) Cost Neutrality -- Ken, where are we? What can we tell
intergov groups tomorrow on timing? What was agency reaction.

 (4) Means Tested -- Elena: what's new.  Latest word from HHS? Are
they redrafting memo to DOJ? How are contacts with the GCs going?
 (5) HHS q/a -- You all are getting copies of HHS q/a for
tomorrow's meeting on a variety of topics hopefully early this
a.m. Ten pages of stuff for clearance TODAY!
Should we set a WH meeting to go over 2-4 and 5, if necessary,
maybe following the implementation group today? Let me know what
you guys think.
