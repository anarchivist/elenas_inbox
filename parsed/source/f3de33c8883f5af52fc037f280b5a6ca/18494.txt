TEXT:
FYI, Maria Echaveste has been pushing for an 800 number for the state of
the union where the President could refer people who want to volunteer, in
connection with the race initiative. The Corporation for National Service
told her it couldn't do this, particularly on such short notice, but
suggested creating a Corp. web site that would point potential volunteers
to existing web sites of the United Way, the big youth service group,
United Way, America's Promise, etc.  So we'll see.  (Previously, Maria
tried to get religious orgs to agree to offer service opportunities, but
didn't get much response.)
