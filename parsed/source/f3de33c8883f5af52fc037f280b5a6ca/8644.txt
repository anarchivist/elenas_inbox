          I have some more information on the Indianapolis desegregation
 case and the NYT times story that is in process. The reporter is Pam
 Belluck from the Chicago Bureau. DOJ (Tom Perez) has spoken to her at
 length, so DOJ's side is surely being heard.
          The case is really an interesting example of the difficulties in
 this area. This is a rare case where there clearly was an inter-district
 violation, extending beyond the boundaries of a single district. The major
 violation was a decision by government officials to create a metropolitan
 area government, but leave an exception for education. It is clear this
 was done to avoid metropolitan-wide desegregation, including bussing. It
 didn't work.
          Bussing across the metropolitan area was ordered, beginning in
 1981. Recently, however, the 7th Circuit had suggested that this remedy
 would have to end at some point. Moreover, the district court found the
 Indianapolis dictrict itself was no longer segregated. The question, then,
 was how far DOJ should go in attempting to preserve a metropolitan-wide
 remedy and whether a settlement would be better than what could result
 from litigation. The settlement provides for a long phaseout of bussing,
 over about 17 years. In place of bussing, the settlement hopes to
 encourage housing integration by creating an entity to assist minority
 families in finding housing.
          If one were to quarrel about the settlement, one could point to
 the fact that the settlement did not require the city to contribute funds
 to help subsidize housing. In order to address this point, DOJ is working
 with HUD to target some assistance in that area. WE CAN BE HELPFUL ON THIS
 BY TALKING WITH HUD OURSELVES. I would be happy to follow up on that, if
 you like.
          Overall, the case to me shows that housing integration is at the
 bottom of the problem. What do we do to encourage integrated housing? The
 federal government surely bears some responsibility through a history of

'.
      subsidizing housing in the inner city. But, there are powerful social
      trends at work that are hard to counter. For example, even middle class
      suburbs tend to be segregated. Chris has suggested having a session on
      integration, so this is a good case study to help focus on the problem.
