            Here is a new Q&A for the press office today which says that we don't
            comment on pending trials, but also lists what the Administration has done
            on hate crimes.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks, Mary =============

                                         Hate Crime Q&A
                                           April 5, 1999

     Q:   What about the article in the Washington Post today about the Matthew Shepard
          trial?

     A:   The Administration does not comment on pending trials. However, the Clinton
          Administration has taken a number of steps to combat hate crimes. In November 1997,
          the President held the first-ever White House Conference on Hate Crimes where he
          announced several initiatives to ensure effective law enforcement, including the creation
          of working groups in every U.S. Attorney's district in the country to improve
          coordination among local, state, and federal prosecutors; the addition of new FBI agents
          and prosecutors to work on enforcement of hate crimes laws; and the development of
          model curriculum for training law enforcement officers to deal with hate crimes. Since
          the conference, the Administration has issued publications such as "Preventing Youth
          Hate Crime: A Manual for Schools and Communities" and "Protecting Students from
          Harassment and Hate Crime." In his FY2000 budget, the President has requested
          approximately $34 million for hate crimes enforcement.
