  The Honorable Pete Stark
  united States House of Representatives
. washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Congressman Stark:

I am writing to convey the U.S. Department of Labor's position on
the "Health Care Worker Needlestick And Sharps Injury Prevention
Act." We believe that this bill takes important steps toward
improving protection for health care workers against injuries from
contaminated needlesticks and other sharps.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is committed
to protecting the health of workers who dedicate themselves to the
health of others, and we are moving forward on this issue. As you
are aware, last fall OSHA issued a Request For Information (RFI)
on this subject in an effort to collect information on how best to
reduce the estimated 590,000 needles ticks occurring among health
care workers each year. We received nearly 400 comments and, based
on these comments, OSHA is pursuing a three-pronged approach to help
minimize the risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne diseases
due to needlestick injuries.

 First, the agency has already proposed to require all injuries
 resulting from contaminated needles and sharps be recorded on OSHA
 logs.  The final recordkeeping rule, based on OSHA's evaluation of
 the public rulemaking record, is scheduled for publication this fall.

 Second, OSHA will revise the bloodborne pathogens compliance
 directive later this year to reflect the newer and safer technologies
 now available. The directive is used by OSHA's compliance officers
 to enforce the agency's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.

 Third, the agency will take steps to propose to amend the Bloodborne
 Pathogens Standard by placing a revision of that rule that will
 address needles tick and sharps injuries on its regulatory agenda
 this fall.

 In our review of the comments received from the RFI, we found that
 a variety of safer devices exist that can protect workers from
 needlestick and sharp injuries i however, these devices are not being
 used widely enough to substantially reduce the hundreds of thousands


    draft

    of injuries each year.   Further, comments indicate that training
    and education in the use of safer medical devices and safe work
    practices have proven effective in preventing exposures.  Finally,
    responses indicate that staff involvement in the selection process
    plays an important role in the acceptance and proper use of safer
    medical devices.

    We support the general intent and approach of your bill; however,
    we believe that there are areas in the bill which need additional
    attention.  These areas include assuring that: all workers who are
    subject to injuries from contaminated needles and other sharps are
    covered by the bill; the paperwork requirements do not result in
    duplicative recording; and your bill is not inconsistent with OSHA's
    Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.

    Again, allow me to express support for the intent and direction of
    your bill.  I look forward to working with you on this important
    occupational health issue as you move your bill through the
    legislative process.

                                        Sincerely,



                                        Alexis M. Herman
