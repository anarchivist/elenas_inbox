seriously, i'm sorry i didn't get back to you today.  it was
awful.
Among other things, USDA is now saying (both Anne and Jim L.) that
they can never offer replacement timber if they have to follow
environmental law.  Huh? I thought this had been brought up
numerous times, and in fact, we just filed a brief stating that
env. law does apply to replacement 'timber.
Things are getting a bit tense on the USDA/CEQ front.  To put it
mildly . . . .

The 4 o'clock conference call is to focus on the Klammath tribes
case. The Forest Service is concerned that we'll overstate their
current interpretation of how treaty rights affect forest
management. Justice is concerned that treaty rights do apply.
DOl is struggling with their trust responsibilities. Lois wants
to transfer to Hogan (that should take care of all of the rest of
the issues!).
I, on the other hand, am defecting to Mongolia.  Have fun with
this crowd!!! !
(seriously, if you can be on the conference call, call Jeff Garver
at DOJ at 305-0481.)
