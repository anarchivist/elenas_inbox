                                              Question and Answer
                                                 June 9, 1998


         Q_    Mr. President, this weekend the National Rifle Association elected Charlton Heston
               as their new President. He said that instead of passing new gun laws, the
               Administration and Congress should focus on enforcing those laws already on the
               books. Furthermore, he challenged the federal government to focus its efforts on a
               single city -- with tough enforcement of the laws -- to see what a difference that can
               make. What is your reaction to his election and your response to his challenge?

         A.    I wish Mr. Heston the best of luck in his new job as President of the NRA, and I hope we
               can work with him to support tough, smart crime policies that keep driving down the
               crime rate. But as for focusing on one city for a single year, that is not a realistic option

               This Administration has worked hand-in-hand with local law enforcement in thousands of
               cities for almost six years now -- and our efforts are making a difference. Murders are
               down more than 25%, violent crime is down more than 15%, and overall crime is at its
               lowest level in a generation. If Mr. Heston and the NRA want to help, I suggest they
               support tougher punishments, more police and better prevention in all of these
               communities.

               But I will agree that tough enforcement and more prosecutions are part of the answer. So
               I Hope Mr. Heston and the NRA will consider supporting our proposals to hire more
               prosecutors and law enforcement officers at all levels of governinent -- especially local
               prosecutors and police officers. The NRA likes to say it is for more law enforcement and
               tough punishments, but they led the fight against the 1994 Crime Act that has provided
               billions of dollars for law enforcement and included some of the toughest penalties ever.
