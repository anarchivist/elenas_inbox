TEXT:
I know we want to sound lukewarm positive about the Chiles proposal.  HHS
leg affairs is getting calls about this.  Should I have them use this
language, which was in the Erskine letter to Senator Graham, in
responding?

As you may recall, during the Senate consideration of   tobacco legislation,
we and the National GovernorsO, Association supported   the approach taken
in the McCain legislation, which provided states with   full funding if they
agreed to spend half the money on an agreed-upon menu   of seven programs.
We continue to believe that this approach would be an   acceptable solution
to the issue.
