TEXT:
The House Democrats proposed a tax credit for stay-at-home parents with
children under 4, which would provide a credit of roughly $900'to these
targeted families.  The credit would be equivalent to the $500 tax credit
plus an additional amount equal to the average increase in tax relief
provided to two-worker families with a young child through the expansion
of the DCTC.
