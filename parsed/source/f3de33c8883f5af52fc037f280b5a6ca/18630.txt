TEXT:
Its that time again! On Monday, February 23, 1998, the President will
convene the yearly NGA Roundtable with the Governors.   I have a
preliminary list of the subjects the Governors will address, and will have
confirmation on the topics this week.   I do not expect them to change.
For those of you who are new to this, the drill is: after the opening
statements (open press), the press departs, and one Governor will
introdu'ce each topic (total of 4-5 Govs, Child Care and Education may be
one topic area), followed by open discussion.

Topics are:
Highways: Robyn
Tobacco: Kagan/Jennings
Child Care: Klein
Education: Cohen/Shireman
Health Care Quality: Jennings



     For each topic, I would like two pages: one page with talking points for
     POTUS (brief) and questions to ask Govs to keep the discussion moving; and
     one page with the most difficult q's and a's.  Please send these to me no
     later than FIRST THING Tuesday, Februaruy 17, 1998.

     Thanks for your help.
