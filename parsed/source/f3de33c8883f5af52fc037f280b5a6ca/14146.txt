 TEXT:
 I just heard from USDA that states are getting interested in
 California's deal of having a hold harmless from QC errors while
 their food stamp waiver request is being evaluated.  First
 Illinois called USDA to learn more.  Then USDA heard that APWA had
 a conference call with states on this and plans to publicize the
 option to its meIDbers.
 So, watch out.
