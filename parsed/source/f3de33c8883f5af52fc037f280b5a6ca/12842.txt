                                 Marriage Statistics Q&A
                                      June 1, 1999


Q:   Why has the federal government stopped collecting data on marriage, as reported in
     USA Today?

A:   The Census Bureau will continue to collect self-reported information on marital status on
     the Census long-form, though they will no longer collect this information on the short
     form. According to HHS, the National Center for Health Statistics stopped collecting
     detailed data on marriage and divorce in January 1996 as a result of budget constraints
     and because of limitations in the information collected by the States. NCHS had to make
     across-the-board budget cuts involving difficult trade-offs, including in their vital
     statistics program. The decision was made to suspend marriage and divorce data
     collection rather than hinder collection of mortality or birth data. The decision was
     influenced by the fact that marriage and divorce data recorded at the state level was
     becoming more incomplete -- for example, by 1997, five states including California did
     not report any information on divorces, and a sixth state stopped reporting the number of
     marriage licenses granted. This information comes from marriage and divorce records
     reported to state registries, thus budget concerns in states have also had an impact on the
     ability to collect national data. The decision to stop collecting these data was published in
     the Federal Register on December 15, 1995.
