TEXT:
Danny Werfel from OMB called to let me know that Sylvia wants Ellen
vargyas (from EEOC) to brief Judy Winston and Ben Johnson on the federal
sector rule before we publish it.  She may also be interested in doing
some kind of roll-out of the rule linked to the PIR. Because of all this,
the rule will likely be delayed at least a week.  I will let you know more
as I do.

Julie
