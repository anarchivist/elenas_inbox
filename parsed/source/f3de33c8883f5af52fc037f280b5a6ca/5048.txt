Subject:         Press conference guidance

Below are the topics for Wednesday's press conference. I have been told
Sylvia Mathews mentioned in the morning meetings today that it is
·

    essential that we get the guidance to the President in a timely fashion.
    I'd appreciate if I could get the Q&A's by lO:OOam tomorrow. As always,
    the Q&As should be forma ted as though the President is actually being
    asked and answering the question. Thank you for your help.
