voinovich will make Block Grants a major initiative at the Feb NGA mtg.
One of the proposals of greatest concern is a block grant on education.
Romer seems ready to sign on, and in the absense of support from other
Governors, Jonathan Jones says Carper will not oppose. If we want to beat
it back, we will have to push. I suggest we arrange a meeting with
Jennifer Davis and possibly DPC to discuss further.
