       Budget balances by 2002 -- for the first time since 1969

New Initiatives

       Agreement provides $34 billion over 5 years for new initiatives, including:

                      $14 billion for restoring medical and disability benefits to legal
                      immigrants and other improvements to the welfare bill, including funding
                      for communities to help welfare recipients move to work

                      Provides $16 to $17 billion to provide health coverage for up to 5 million
                      children by 2002

Discretionary Spending

      Non-defense discretionary outlays are within 1 percent of the President's FY 1998 Budget
      request over 5 years -- protecting education, the environment, international and other
      priorities

      Defense spending meets President's FY 1998 Budget request (on budget authority)

Medicare & Medicaid

      Medicare savings of $115 billion over 5 years, extending the life of the Trust Fund until
      at least 2007

                     Modernizes Medicare by providing new health plan choices such as PPOs
                     and PSOs and new preventive care benefits, including annual
                     mammograms without co-payments, diabetes self-management, and
                     colorectal screenings

                     Reforms outdated payment methodology for home health, skilled nursing
                     facilities, outpatient departments, and HMOs

                     Phases in, over time, cost of home health care into Part B premium with
                     expanded low income protections

      Medicaid: Imposes new cost constraints (e.g., on disproportionate share hospital
      payments), while maintaining the Federal guarantee. The agreement responds to States'
      concerns by dropping the per capita cap proposal, and allowing States more flexibility to
      manage their Medicaid programs.
