TEXT:
I just wanted to be sure we were fully coordinated on how best to
move forward on immigration/welfare issues. As far as I can tell,
this is by far the most complex area'we are dealing in our
implementation effort.
Immediate meetings/issues:
There is a meeting called by you Ken tomorrow at 3:00 to discuss
the "means tested program" definition.
On Thursday at 5:00, Seth Waxman is coming over to go over the
entire range of these issues and to review the process DOJ and INS
are putting into place.
We have yet to fully resolve the California food stamp question.
We have the oustanding issue of what exactly the notices to SSI
recipients should be and when they should go out.

For Thursday 5:00:
I have asked Steve Warnath to put together his best take of a
laundry list of ALL the issues in this sphere that we need to deal
with.  I think we should go through that list and ensure that DPC,
OMB, Counsel's Office, DOJ and INS are in agreement that that is
the right list and what the processes are to address those issues.
I would like to empower Steve at that meeting to serve on all of
our behalfs as an oversight person to ensure these pieces keep
moving and to serve as a central information depot.
Let's talk in advance of the Thursday 5:00 if any of you have a
problem with that.
Steve and Diana will both be at the 3:00 tomorrow, Ken, although
Diana may be a little late.
