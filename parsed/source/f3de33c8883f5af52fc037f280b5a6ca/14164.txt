TEXT:
Uh-oh.
I think the decision is to say the following, more or less:
It is our intention that states should not use waivers to evade
the work requirements and the time limits of the bill.  While
there seems to be conflict between the language of the law and
Congress's intent, states should not attempt to evade the law's
requirements, or we will seek a legislative fix to the bill, as
doubtless Congress would as well.
Reactions?
