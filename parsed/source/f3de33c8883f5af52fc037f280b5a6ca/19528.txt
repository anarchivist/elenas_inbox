TEXT:
There are currently no good options for CA Message Events, and
Scheduling/Communications would like for us to come up w/ at least one.
POTUS will be in the Palo Alto area (not San Fran) on Friday, May 1, and
he'll be in LA on Monday, May 4. They would like us to explore:
1.      Tobacco Event for Monday in LA.
2.      21st Century Learning Program event in Palo Alto.

The Palo Alto event could have a tough time breaking through b/c of the
timing, and therefore the news threshold isn't as high.  If we have any
good message suggestions, we should recommend them for LA.
