TEXT:

Chris -- Nanda Chitre has requested press guidance on the Varmus testimony
by 11:30 a.m.   Pasted below is a "placeholder" because Varmus is
currently testifying as we speak.  We'd appreciate having the benefit of
your edits and suggestions.

Rachel Levinson is at the hearing now and is expected to report in
shortly. A key issue of press interest is whether Dr. Varmus will say
that the statute does or does not permit NIH-funded scientists to use some
of the stem cells that were produced by the scientists 'on the second
panel. DHHS General Counsel has not reached a decision on this point and
Dr. Varmus' written testimony does not answer the question, and he will
probably be pressed on the issue.

It may make sense to pass this current version along to Nanda -- with your
edits included -- 'and then, shortly before noon, update the Q&A section in
light of wha~ actually transpired this morning's hearing.

   CONTEXT: Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutes of Health testifies
   today before the Senate Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee. The subject of the
   hearing is human stem cell research.


General

Dr. Varmus will appear as the first witness, followed by the second panel including Drs.
James Thomson (University of Wisconsin), John Gearhart (Johns Hopkins University) and
Michael West (Advanced Cell Technology, Inc), the scientists associated with three
experiments reported recently in which human stem cells were produced from human
embryos, fetal tissue, and a human somatic cell fused to a cow egg, respectively. A third
panel will be comprised of ethicists including Dr. Arthur Caplan (University of
Pennsylvania).

Dr. Varmus will describe the potential scientific and medical benefits of research using
human stem cells including the development of treatments for cancer, heart disease,
diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, stroke, burns, and arthritis. Additionally,
Dr. Varmus will discuss some of the ethical issues raised by human stem cell research and
will reaffirm his commitment to the President's 1994 ban on the use of NIH funds to create
human embryos for research purposes.

Beginning in FY 96, annual Congressional appropriations language has extended beyond
the President's ban in forbidding research in which an embryo is knowingly discarded,
destroyed or exposed to greater than minimal risk. Patient advocacy groups and scientific
societies have written Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Specter seeking reversal of the
Congressional ban and supporting stem cell research.

Q. What is the Administration's view on human stem cell research?

A. We are told that·human stem cell research has great promise, and we are hopeful that
   these predictions will bear out. Nevertheless, there are a number of ethical, medical
   and legal issues that need to sorted out before a policy decision can be made. The
   President has asked his National Bioethics Advisory Commission to undertake a
   thorough review of the issues associated with human stem cell research, balancing all
   the ethical and medical considerations. The Commission's report will assist in defining
   our next steps.

Q. What is the Administration's view on the Congressional ban on Federally-funded
   human embryo research?

         A. Given the dynamic nature of the science and how that science shapes our ethical
            understanding, we believe the President's 1994 directive banning the use of Federal
            funds for the creation of human embryos for research provides appropriate
            restrictions. Each year, the President's budget has proposed deleting the broader
            Congressional ban and has objected to addressing this issue in statute.

         Q. Was public funding used to support this research?

         A. No. The human stem cell research discussed at today's Senate hearing was privately
            funded.
