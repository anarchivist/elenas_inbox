     TEXT:
     I have set up a schedule of brown bag lunches, for the interns.  I would
     like to thank all of our Special Assistants for finding time in their busy
     schedules, to arrange a meeting with DPC's interns. We would like the
     interns to come to Paul's office in room 214, at 11:45 a.m. on the dates
     listed below. At noon, in room 211, the interns will then meet with the
     Special Assistant scheduled to speak on that day.  Let's all please try to
     keep these commitments, as our interns last day will be, July 3rd.
