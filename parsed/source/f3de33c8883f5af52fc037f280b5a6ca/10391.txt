TEXT:
BR/EK:

Spoke w/Michael about the Budget and new initiatives pot. He was unsure
about how much came out of the new initiatives pot, but thought the $650
million COPS add-on was the most likely candidate (thought he didn'y
believe it was at risk from OMB or DOJ's perspective).   If that's the
case, we should assume the following about the $1.3 billion in COPS II
funding:

1 $650 M in COPS sealed by DOJ deal.   This includes:
- $300 M in passback for· COPS hiring;
- $200 M in DOJ technology initiatives (Brady, sex offenders, DNA/crime
labs, comm.); &
- $150 M in original base for community/juvenile prosecutors.

2.   $650 M COPS add-on from new initiatives pot, and supported by DOJ,
including:
- $300 M in extra hiring money (can include new race earmark, allows
10,000 more cops);
- $150 M add-on for technology (i~cludes crime forecasting, DNA backlog,
etc. ); &
- $50 M add-on for prosecutors (includes non-hiring programs Holder/DOJ
wants) ;
- $150 M for community crime prevention (only new prevention/innovative $
in budget) .

Again, at the end of the day, the overall COPS II $ can be somewhat
fungible ..
DOJ is meeting wIthe AG today to go over state/local law enforcement budget
one more time. Once she's on board with our outline, DOJ will fight money
being taken away for other non-crime initiatives. My guess is that they
would be
least offended by cuts to the hiring monies, as opposed to toys and soft
stuff ... jc3
