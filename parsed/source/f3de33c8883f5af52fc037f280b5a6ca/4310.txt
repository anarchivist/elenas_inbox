MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:         Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:      Tobacco Rollout Plan

This memo describes the rollout plan for our tobacco announcement. Our goal is to build
momentum and support for the enactment of comprehensive tobacco legislation within the next
year.

Notifying Key Players

Prior to the announcement, we will inform key players about what the President plans to say on
Wednesday. We are working with OPL, Legislative Affairs, Intergovernmental Affairs, and
HHS toward ensuring that key Members of Congress, attorneys general, governors, and leaders
of the public health community are prepared to validate the President's position.

Donna and I will meet with the House and Senate Democratic Tobacco Task Forces late in the
day on Tuesday. We will offer to meet with the Republican leadership. I will call Governors
Hunt, Patton, and Chiles and David Kessler, C. Everett Koop, and Matt Myers.

Event and Communications

There will be considerable press interest in our announcement. We should take advantage of the
heightened interest to get out our message, shape the debate, and build momentum for enactment
of comprehensive tobacco legislation.

McCurry, Rahm, and I have developed a plan to give advance details ofthe President's proposal
to the major papers for Wednesday morning. With so many Members of Congress being briefed
tomorrow, we don't think the story would hold anyway.

To get the most out ofthe event itself, we should do a Rose Garden event where we can surround
the President with leaders from public health, the attorneys general, and the Congress. Our goal
is a picture that sends a clear message that we are putting the public interest first. From the
public health community, we expect the leaders of the American Cancer Society, the American
Heart Association, and the American Medical Association, David Kessler, Matt Myers, and
possibly C. Everett Koop. From the attorneys general, we expect Mike Moore, Christine
Gregoire, Grant Woods, and possibly Bob Butterworth and Scott Harshberger. From Congress,
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion


we hope to attract members and leadership from both parties. The audience of 100-150, will be
a mix of public health experts who participated in our public outreach meetings, agency staff
who conducted the interagency review, and individuals from a list we requested from the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

The event itself will be limited to remarks by the Vice-President and President. Donna, Dan
Glickman, and I will join the President, Vice-President, and validators on stage. Donna and I
will lead Mike McCurry's afternoon briefing.

We will provide a short handout to the press describing the President's approach, and we will
prepare Q&As for the press office and others.

Follow-up

In addition to the typical follow-up briefings for interested groups, we will develop a detailed
plan of actions we will take throughout the remainder of 1997 to maintain interest and build
momentum for enactment of comprehensive legislation next year. At the same time, we will
develop a detailed plan for working with Congress to enact legislation next year. The President
should announce Wednesday that he will invite Congressional leaders to the White House next
month to develop a bipartisan process to enact tobacco legislation. We will work with the
Vice-President and his staff to establish a visible leadership role for him.
