Well, yes.   (Yes to everything you state.)
I believe TJ is going to talk to Greg Frazier about the state of
play this am.    I have a call into Anne and will ask her to send
the Qs and As around asap, and try to make sure that they cover
all the issues you raised, Debbie.    I also have a call into Jim
and hopefully, he will have made the call to the Carpenters Union
this am.   In terms of the directive, my own sense is that we have
answers to most of these and other obvious questions, but may be
dealing with internal USDA/FS concerns about doing this.
