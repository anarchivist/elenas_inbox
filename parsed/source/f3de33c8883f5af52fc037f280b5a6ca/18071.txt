TEXT:
Our memo says that the additional money will enable OFCCP to review 30% of
companies that do business with the government.  They say they can do it
even if we cut $5 million from the fund, they will shift the money
around.   If we want to do much deeper cuts to the program, we may need to
adjust the 30% figure.
