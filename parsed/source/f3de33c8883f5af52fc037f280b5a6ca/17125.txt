                                  Weekly Report: Education


National Testing: There have been a number of developments with regard to your testing
initiative this week:

Test Development: The group working on test specifications completed its work almost two
weeks ago, and included a controversial proposal that would permit students to use calculators
while taking the entire math test. Both the content of this recommendation as well as the fact
that work on test development was continuing under the Education Department's direct auspices
was causing consternation among Congressional Republicans as well as key supports such as
Finn, Ravitch and Bennett. This week, Secretary Riley released a statement disagreeing with the
calculator recommendation, underscoring the importance of the Senate-approved plan for placing
NAGB in charge of the tests, and announcing that the test contractor would not develop any test
items until NAGB approves the test specifications. This move has reassured some of our
Republican supporters that we are not intending to proceed independently ofNAGB. However,
Bill Goodling responded with a release of his own, denouncing Riley's statement, alleging that
NAGB will become a "national school board", and vowing to continue to oppose the tests.

Senate Filibusters: On Thursday, Sen. Ashcroft released a letter signed by 27 Republicans
expressing opposition to the tests, urging the conferees to support the Goodling amendment, and
threatening to filibuster the Labor-HHS appropriations bill if the conference report includes
support for the testing initiative. Unfortunately, 14 Republicans who initially voted to support
the NAGB provision in the Senate have now switched sides, clearly under pressure from the
Eagle Forum and related groups. We are trying to work with Checker Finn and, through him
Bill Bennett, to provide public support for the Senate provision, in order to shore up the
remaining Republicans.        In addition, under the leadership of Senator Bingaman, today 43
Democratic Senators signed a letter vowing to filibuster if the conference report does not include
the compromise testing plan as passed by the Senate 87-13.

Bill Goodling Letter: Late Friday afternoon you received a letter from Bill Goodling concluding
that " ... Your stance on testing is making my job of authorizing an "America Reads" program
almost impossible." Neither DPC nor NEC believes we should consider the implied trade at all.
 We are working together to determine the most appropriate response to the letter.


Single Sex Schools: New York City opened the Young Women's Leadership School this fall, a
girls-only school for grades 7-9. Some civil rights advocates in New York have filed a
complaint, charging that the school violates Title IX prohibitions against sex discrimination.
Last week the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights responded to the complaint by
asking the Board of Education to begin negotiations to resolve the issue, either by admitting boys
or by establishing a separate program for boys only. DPC is working with the Counsel's office
to determine the underlying legal and policy issues, and will work with the Departments of
Justice and Education in order to determine how best to proceed.
                                                        ~ Conversion

Vouchers: On Tuesday, Secretary Riley released "What Really Matters in American Education"
 a brief report making the case for continued improvement in public schools -- including the
need to intervene in and turn around failing public schools -- and against vouchers. On
Thursday the Senate debated the DC appropriations bill, with Democrats filibustering because of
a voucher provision, similar to one you have previously vetoed. A cloture vote is expected
Tuesday morning. Education groups count a solid 43 votes to sustain the filibuster. If the
cloture motion fails, there is some possibility that Senators Coats and Lieberman could withdraw
the voucher provision. In the House, the Appropriations Committee is scheduled to mark-up its
DC bill Monday. Rep. Dixon is leading efforts against "scholarship" provisions sponsored by
Rep. Armey, but has not confirmed whether he will seek to substitute other programs or simply
move to strike.

The House version of the Coverdell K-12 IRA proposal, sponsored by the Speaker, is expected to
be marked-up by Ways and Means on October 8. A floor vote will likely occur as part of a
Republican "Education Week" October 20 to 24, which would also include action on a
reading/literacy bill, charter schools legislation, and FFELlDirect Lending consolidation.
Education is working with Mr. Rangel on a possible alternative related to his tax provisions
passsed as part of the Balanced Budget Agreement. In the Senate, there is no clear sense either
of timing or vehicle for Coverdell to be considered. When it does, however, Democrats are
likely to offer the Daschle school construction bill as an alternative.
