TEXT:
Barbara Chow asked us to share the draft HHS language below with you on
the Hyde Amendment in the L/HHS Appropriations bill for your clearance.
HHS would like to give this language to Senator Harkin's staff so that he
may offer it during tomorrow's Senate Appropriations Committee markup of
the L/HHS bill.   It would serve as a counter-proposal to an expected
Amendment to be offered by Sen. Craig, which HHS believes will be similar
to one offered by Rep. Wolf in the House.   In the House L/HHS SAP, the
Administration opposed the Wolf Amendment because we thought it could
"curtail the availability of State-only and privately funded abortion
 services.   11




HHS believes that the language below is an acceptable alternative that
would clarify the Hyde Amendment prohibition so that it would only apply
to Federal funds appropriated in the L/HHS bill.

Rich Tarplin's staff would like to get this language to Harkin's staff
tonight in time for tomorrow morning's   (7/24) 10:00 a.m. mark-up of the
bill.   They are seeking OMB and your clearance before they give it to
Harkin's staff.

Please call Holly Bode on Rich Tarplin's staff at 690-7485 or at home
r==-~~with clearance or questions.                   My office number is 5-7791 and
I can be reached at home at~I____p~6~/(~b.)~(6~)__~1


DRAFT HHS LANGUAGE:
"None of the funds appropriated under this Act shall be expended for any
abortion, except when such a procedure is necessary to save the life of
the woman or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.

None of the funds appropriated under this Act may be used to purchase
health benefit coverage that includes coverage for abortions unless the
Federal contribution and the state funds eligible for matching under Title
XIX are limited to those abortion services necessary to save the life of
the woman or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest."
