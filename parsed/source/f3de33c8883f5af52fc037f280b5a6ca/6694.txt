     TEXT:
     HHS would like to send a letter to Shaw in response to his very strong
     letter that criticized the high performance bonus guidance for omitting a
     family formation measure.  They are in a hurry because they want this out
     before Olivia's hearing in the House on Thursday.

     In case you never had a chance to read that letter, it says that selecting
     just one of the four goals of TANF is "illegal".   In response to our
     argument that the illegitimacy bonus should take care of some of the other
     goals, he wrote, "I can assure you that Congress deliberately included
     what amounts to a double bonus for reducing illegitimacy and increasing
     marriage.  So important are illegitimacy and divorce as national problems
     that Congress decided to give substantial rewards to states that reduce
     nonmarital births or increase the percentage of children living in
     two~parent families."


     HHS's proposed letter back to Shaw is below. The threshold question for
     us is whether we want to accommodate Shaw in the NPRM in some way, or
     whether we are prepared to endure his ire and ignore him. This will
     determine the tone we want in the letter.  This draft seems reasonable to
     me, unless we have no plans whatsoever to accommodate him. What do you
     think?


     Dear Congressman Shaw:

     Thank you for your letter of March 5 concerning the "Draft Potential
     Specifications for Interim Award of High Performance Bonus (FY 1999)."   I
     value your perspective on this very important matter.

     The proposed specifications are intended to be included in guidance that
     would be effective only in the first bonus year.  They were developed in
     consultation with the National Governors' Association, the American Public
     Welfare Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures and
     State representatives.  I believe that they reflect the most integral
     aspects of work in welfare reform.  The four work measures we will use to
     award the first year High Performance Bonus (HPB) reflect all aspects of a


state's success in moving families from welfare to employment-based
self-sufficiency.  Full success requires recipients not only to get jobs,
but sustain them, and to increase their earnings in order to be
independent and capable of supporting their families.   [Necessary?)

In our extensive consultations, we explored a range of measures addressing
family formation and stability. We moved ahead with respect to work,
because we believed it was vital for states to have guidance with respect
to how FY 1998 performance would be measured.  However, we had difficulty
in identifying discrete measures that would provide effective incentives
to states to design programs and policies that would achieve the
objectives of TANF and for which a reliable data source existed or could
be quickly developed.  I remain committed to exploring measures that
encompass all of the goals of TANF, including family formation and
stability, for the HPB in future years and will seek advice on this matter
through the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking process.

I appreciate your support for the role of the HPB as a key tool in making
welfare reform successful.  I remain firm in my belief in the importance
of our continuing to work with your committee in all matters, including
the development of HPB for future years, and have asked Assistant
Secretary Golden to meet with your staff in preparation for the Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking.
