I made changes per Bruce's comments. He wants to know if you think we
should add a bullet on the connection to liability.  I don't think we
should. After all, we kind of like the public health link, but this is
supposed to be a unity document that gets all us Dems talking off the same
page, so mentioning liability is dangerous.

This looks OK, except for the first bullet.   I would make the penalties
argument the way Erskine does:

1. The $3.5 billion cap on penalties significantly reduces the incentive
for the tobacco industry to reduce youth smoking. Under the current plan,
the tobacco industry would pay the same penalty for missing the youth
smoking targets by 40% as it would for missing the targets by 20%.  The
cap should be eliminated or raised to a higher level, so that the tobacco
industry has the strongest incentive to do everything in its power to stop
hooking kids.

2.  Individual companies need to be held accountable for reducing youth
smoking as well.  In addition to strong industry-wide penalties, a
separate company-by-company penalty scheme will help take the profit out
of addicting teenagers.

3.   If EK thinks so, something about closing the liability/performance


loophole (although I wouldn't call it a loophole).

"Medicaid Provider Tax and Donation Amendments of 1998"
Section
,J
-by
LJ
-section Summary

(Except as otherwise indicated, this bill amends provisions of
the Social Security Act.  References to the "Secretary" are to
the Secretary of Health and Human Services.)

SEC. 2. HEALTH CARE LICENSING FEES.
        Section 2 makes various amendments to provisions of 1903(w)
that specify the types of health care related taxes that will be
treated as "impermissible taxes" for purposes of determining
whether a State will be subject to a disallowance of medical
assistance expenditures eligible for Federal matching payments.
These amendments provide that a tax consisting of a licensing fee
or similar charge will not be subject to a disallowance if (1)
the total amount of revenue raised by the State from such tax
will be used in the administration of the licensing program for
which the charge was assessed or for regulation of the entities
subject to the charge, and the State maintains on file a
certification by the Governor (or other official specified by the
Secretary) to that effect; and (2) the tax does not contain a
hold
o
-harmless provision.
        The bill also provides that if the Secretary finds that the
State has used any revenue from a tax described above for
purposes other than those described in a certification, the
Governor (or other certifying official) is subject to a civil
monetary penalty of not to exceed $10,000.    The bill specifies
the administrative procedures that will apply if the Secretary
imposes a civil monetary penalty pursuant to this authority.
SEC. 3. SECRETARY'S AUTHORITY TO ADJUST CERTAIN AMOUNTS OWED BY
                         STATES.
        Section 3 amends section 1903(w) (1) (A) (which requires that
the amount of State medical assistance expenditures eligible for
Federal matching payments be reduced by the amount of State
revenues from certain impermissible taxes and donations (the
"standard reduction") and adds new subparagraphs (H) and (I) to
section 1903(w) (1). The amendments require the Secretary to
reduce the amount of the standard reduction attributable to
revenues from impermissible tax or donation programs in effect
prior to the date of enactment of the bill if the State
eliminates all such impermissible programs within two years of
enactment of the bill. The Secretary is not authorized to adjust
the amount of the standard reduction for revenues (1) received

more than one year after the enactment of the bill; or (2) from
impermissible tax or donation programs initiated after the


enactment of the bill.
         The bill requires the Secretary to determine an appropriate
adjustment percentage within a range that varies depending on the
date by which the State eliminates all such past tax or donation
programs (the "compliance date").   For a State with a compliance
date that is (1) within one year after the enactment of the bill,
the range is 20 to 60 percent of the standard reduction; and (2)
more than one year, but less than two years, after such
enactment, the range is 50 to 80 percent of the standard
reduction.
         In determining the appropriate percentage within the ranges
described above, the Secretary is required to consider the
following factors: (1) whether the tax or donation program is
permissible under the bill; (2) whether the State voluntarily
eliminated the tax or ceased to collect the donation prior to
formal notification from the Secretary; (3) the level of burden
the tax or donation program placed on the Medicaid program; (4)
whether the tax or donation program was initiated prior to the
enactment of the Medicaid voluntary Contribution and
Provider
o
-Specific Tax Amendments of 1991; (5) whether the State
cooperated with the Secretary after the enactment of the 1998
Amendments by informing the Secretary of all impermissible tax or
donation programs, providing the Secretary with all information
necessary for the evaluation of such programs, and expeditiously
eliminating such programs; and (6) the number of years the
impermissible tax or donation program was in effect.
        The bill authorizes the Secretary to take adjusted
reductions against States over a five year period.     The Secretary
is required to take a minimum of 20 percent of a State's
reduction amount per fiscal year, unless the State agrees to
allow the Secretary to take the remaining balance in fewer than
five years.
SEC. 4. GENERALLY REDISTRIBUTIVE WAIVER TEST.
        Section 4 amends section 1903 (w) (3) (E) (the "waiver"
authority under which a tax that does not otherwise meet the
requirements for treatment as a broad
LJ

-based and uniform tax will
be so treated if the Secretary finds that it is generally
redistributive and does not include a hold

-harmless provision) .
The amendments clarify that a tax cannot be considered.generally
redistributive unless the burden it places on the Medicaid
program is no greater than the burden that would be placed on the
Medicaid program by a tax that is broad
o
-based and uniform.

        The amendments also prescribe elements of the method for
performing the calculation to determine whether a proposed tax is
generally redistributive.  Specifically, a State must compare (A)
the revenues that would be raised if the State were to tax all
health care items, services, or providers within the class or
classes that the State proposes to tax (including all Medicare
and Medicaid revenues and receipts), with (B) the revenues that
would be raised from only those items, services, or providers
that are subject to the proposed tax.


         Finally, the amendments add a new provision that allows a
 State that seeks to impose a tax on more than one class of health
 care items, services, or providers to consider in the aggregate
 the net impact of the tax on all such classes when performing the
 generally redistributive test.
 SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL PERMISSIBLE HEALTH CARE CLASSES.

         Section 5 amends section 1903(w) (7) (A)   (which specifies the
 classes of items or services on which a broad
 o
 -based tax may be
 imposed).  First, the bill adds as permissible classes (1) health
 insurance coverage; and (2) every health care item or service
 within a State.   Second, in order to clarify the conditions under
 which the Secretary may establish an additional class, the bill
 adds language from the preamble to the final provider tax and
 donation regulation published on August 13, 1993, specifying that
 the additional class must meet the following criteria: (1) no
 more than 50 percent of the gross revenues or receipts of the
 class may be derived from Medicaid; (2) no more than 80 percent
 of such revenues or receipts may be derived from Medicaid, the
 Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, and any other
 Federal health care program; (3) the class is a designated
 category for purposes of State licensing or Federal regulation or
 taxation, is included as a type of health care provider under
 Medicare or Medicaid, or is otherwise clearly identifiable; and
 (4) the class is not unique to a State.
