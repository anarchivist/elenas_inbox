    Subject:         Summit

    Let's catch up tomorrow, if you'd like on service summit.

    I.      Just talked to Powell's guy, Col. Smolin, re: next week.
    Meeting is set for Thursday 11 am here in Roos. Room. Carole Parma lee and
    I spoke earlier. Harris: not available that day, but we should still go
    forward. Henry is all set. Should we brief Erskine Wednesday?
    II.     Smolin and Stuart are amendable to weekly Thursday meetings at
    the staff level. Also, amenable to weekly Tuesday conference calls at
    staff level. Maybe 1-2 Powell-Cisneros-Bowles meetings before the summit.
    III.     Diana, Eli, Bibb and I met to review
    communications/scheduling options. We will work up a plan by early next
    week with ideas for the lead-up and the Summit itself, share with Eli and
    then with you.~,-=e~t~a~l~.________________________________________________________-,


                                                                   P2, P6/(b)(6)




    IV.           Key Issue: Staffing. We think that we should:

       A) have several Administration people working at the Summit with Stuart.
    These could be agency people "on assignment" (I think that's the right
    personnel term) or detailed. This would help us be as helpful as possible

press, logistics, et al. How does this sound?

Let's talk tomorrow, if you'd like. Just call or page.
