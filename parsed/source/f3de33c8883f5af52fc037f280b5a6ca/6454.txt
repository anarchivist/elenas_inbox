DRAFT 2-25-98 6:30 P.M.

I.     BAN ON OUTDOOR ADVERTISING, INCLUDING IN STADIA AND ARENAS

       I.     What data does the Administration have to substantiate that a ban on outdoor
              advertising, including stadia and arenas, will reduce smoking and, in particular,
              youth smoking?

        The FDA tobacco rule prohibits outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of public
playgrounds and elementary and secondary schools. All other outdoor advertising is restricted
to black text on a white background, devoid of color and imagery. FDA's regulations are based
on the agency's finding that children and adolescents spend a great deal of time in areas around
schools and playgrounds and these areas, therefore, should be free of tobacco product
advertising. All other outdoor advertising should be restricted to text information only, which
generally is not appealing to young people. (See response to question II, below.) Data
supporting this conclusion are detailed at 61 Fed. Reg. 44501-08.

       2..     To what extent do you believe such restrictions can be expected to reduce
                             smoking?

        FDA's advertising restrictions are based on quantitative and qualitative studies of
cigarette advertising that show that a causal relationship exists between tobacco advertising and
tobacco use by young people and that stringent advertising restrictions, when combined with a
comprehensive program designed to reduce initiation and use among young people, will have a
positive effect on reducing smoking rates and youth tobacco use.

        FDA's findings regarding the ability of advertising restrictions to reduce youth tobacco
use are summarized at 60 Fed. Reg. 41330-34 and 61 Fed. Reg. 44466-500.

       3.      Does the Administration support such a ban. If so, why? If not, why not?

         The Administration supports appropriate restrictions on outdoor advertising, as evidenced
by the FDA tobacco rule (21 C.F.R. 897.30(b)) which prohibits outdoor advertising for cigarettes
and smokeless tobacco, including billboards, posters, or placards, from being placed within 1,000
feet of the perimeter of any public playground or playground area in a public park, elementary or
secondary school. All other outdoor advertising is limited to black text on a white background
(21 C.F.R. 897.32(a)).

        The prohibition set forth in Section 101(a)(l), however, would prohibit "any form of
outdoor tobacco product advertising, including bill boards, posters, or placards." It does not
contain the exception for tombstone advertising in certain locations that is included in the FDA
regulation. Because that exception ensures that the FDA regulations are appropriately tailored to
serve the government's substantial interest in reducing teenage smoking, Section 101(a)(I)'s
broader restriction on all outdoor tobacco advertising raises significant constitutional concerns
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversj~n

that are not presented by the FDA regulations. We believe, however, that volutltar), limits of
this kind would be of significant value to the public health and the Administration would like to
work with you and others to minimize constitutional difficulties.

       4.      What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implementing the
               ban would the Administration propose? Please provide specifics.

         As discussed above, the Administration's efforts have been focused on supporting the
restrictions now codified in FDA regulations. The Administration urges Congress to provide
statutory confirmation of the existing authority of the FDA to regulate the outdoor advertising of
tobacco products. The resources ofthe Administration are·available to assist the Committee in
determining whether further restrictions are constitutional and otherwise appropriate.


II.    BAN ON HUMAN FIGURES AND CARTOON FIGURES IN ADVERTISING

       1.      What data does the Administration have to substantiate that barring the use of
               human figures and cartoon advertising will reduce smoking, in particular youth
               smoking?

         FDA's regulations restrict advertising, with certain exceptions, to black text on a white
background. No color or imagery is permitted. These restrictions encompass a prohibition of
human figures and cartoon characters. The restrictions apply to billboards, publications, in-stoie
advertising, and direct mail advertisements. FDA's findings in this area are ~ummarized at 60
Fed. Reg. 41335-36 and 61 Fed. Reg. 44466-68, 44508-13. FDA's Federal Register documents
contain specific evidence and summaries of studies. See 60 Fed. Reg. 41333-34 and 61 Fed.
Reg. 44475-82. A new study, published in the February18th edition of The Journal of the
American Medical Association (lAMA), found that tobacco industry advertising and promotional
activities influence teens to start smoking and that 34 percent of teen smoking could be attributed
to tobacco promotional activities.

       2.      To what extent do you believe such restrictions can be counted on to reduce youth
               smoking?

       See response to 1.2., above.

       3.      What entity would you propose to deterinine what constitutes a human image or
               cartoon character?

       Under the FDA's regulations, the requirement that tobacco advertisements under most
circumstances use black text on a white background is enforced by the Food and Drug
Administration and the Department of Justice under the provisions of the Food, Drug, Cosmetic

                                                2

Act. . That Act provides for the imposition of civil penalties, 21 U.S.C. § 333(t), injunctive
relief, 21 U.S.C. § 332, and/or criminal prosecution, 21 U.S.C. § 333(a).

       4.      What penalty do you believe is appropriate and should accrue for a violation of
               the prohibition on material containing figures determined to be human or cartoon?
                                                                                   ,)


         Under the FDA's regulations, the requirement that tobacco advertisements under most
circumstances use black text on a white background is enforced by the Food and Drug
Administration and the Department of Justice under the provisions of the Food, Drug, Cosmetic
Act. That Act provides for the imposition of civil penalties, 21 U.S.C. § 333(t), injunCtive
relief, 21 U.S.C. § 332, and/or criminal prosecution, 21 U.S.C. § 333(a).

       5.      Does the Administration support this ban? Ifso, why? If not, why not?

        The Administration supports appropriate advertising restrictions, as evidenced by the
FDA tobacco rule. The Administration also supports enactment of legislation confirming the
existing authority of the FDA to regulate the use of images in the advertising of tobacco
products. This regulatory approach would ensure that the FDA would be authorized, based on
existing and future research, to develop necessary and appropriately tailored supplements to its
current restrictions, if and when such supplements are needed.

         Section IOI(b) ofS. 1414 provides that "[n]o manufacturer, distributor, or retailer may
use a human image or a cartoon character or cartoon-type character in its advertising, labeling, or
promotional material with respect to a tobacco product." This restriction would go beyond the
FDA regulation restricting the use of images in the advertising of tobacco products, which
provides that, in general, tobacco advertising must take the form of tombstone advertising but
permits images to be used without restriction in an "adult publication," one whose'readership is
at least 85 percent adult and includes less than two million children. 21 C.F.R. §
897.32(a)(2)(i)-(ii). The provision's broader restriction on the use of images in the advertising of
tobacco products would raise significant constitutional concerns that the FDA regulation does not
present. We believe a voluntary industrywide ban would be of significant value to the public
health and the Administration would like to work with you and others to minimize constitutional
difficulties.

       6.      What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implementing the ban
               would the Administration propose? Please provide specifics.

      As discussed above, the Administration's efforts have been focused on the restrictions
now codified in FDA regulations. The resources of the Administration are available to assist the
Committee in discussing how these restrictions will be implemented and the associated penalties,
and whether further restrictions are constitutional and otherwise appropriate.

III.   BAN ON INTERNET ADVERTISING

       1.      Does the Administration support such a ban? If so, why? If not, why not?

       2.      How can and should a ban on Internet advertising of cigarettes be enforced?

       3.      What, if any, concerns does the Administration have regarding the
               constitutional free speech issues raised by any such ban?

       4.      What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implementing the
               ban would the Administration propose?

        In response to III. I - 1Il.4, the Administration believes that, because there may be more
narrowly tailored means of achieving the government's underlying interest in restricting the
advertising of tobacco products on the Internet, the categorical prohibition that Section 101(c) of
S.1414 would impose raises significant constitutional concerns. See Reno v. ACLU, 117 S.Ct.
2329,2348 (1997) (explaining that compelled tagging schemes are obvious less restrictive
alternative to banning Internet transmission of content harmful to minors). \Vhile we would
applaud a volufltary limit of this Idfld, w We therefore caution the Congress about adopting such
a broad measure at this time and would like to work with you and others to minimize
constitutional difficulties.

        In order to ensure that the government retains necessary flexibility to regulate the
advertising of tobacco products on the Internet, we recommend that the Congress provide express
statutory confirmation of the FDA's existing authority to regulate such advertising. This
regulatory approach will ensure that any future restrictions are targeted at the right forms of
Internet advertising and are fashioned in a manner that is appropriately sensitive to First
Amendment concerns. Alternatively, we are prepared to work with Congress to fashion a more
narrowly focussed Internet restriction.


IV.    BAN ON POINT-OF-SALE ADVERTISING

       1.      What data does the Administration have to substantiate that a ban on
               point-of-sale advertising would reduce smoking, in particular, youth
               smoking?

        See responses to 1.2. and II.I., above, regarding FDA's proposal restricting point-of-sale
advertising. In its tobacco rulemaking, FDA found that young people get their information and
product imagery from all types of advertising, including at the point of sale. See 61 Fed. Reg.
44509 - 44510. Point-of-sale advertising presents the child with an enticement at the time when
purchase is immediately available.

                                                 4
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
DRAFT 2-25-98 6:30 P.M.

         Manufacturers and retailers limited to text- only advertising at point of sale will not be
prohibited from promoting products at retail. Adult consumers looking for price and product
information will be able to find that information even without imagery and colors, which are
particularly attractive to children. While text-only advertising can still be effective with adults,
it will have less allure and be less appealing to young people. Children, and adolescents, who are
less willing than adults to process print information in a leisurely setting (such as reading a
magazine), will find textual material even less appealing in the few moments spent at the retail
counter.

       2.      Does the Administration support such a ban? If so, why? If not, why not?

       The Administration supports appropriate restrictions on point of sale advertising, as
evidenced by the FDA tobacco rule. As discussed above, its efforts have been focused on
supporting the restrictions now codified in FDA regulations. The resources of the
Administration are available to assist the Committee in determining whether further restrictions
are constitutional and otherwise appropriate.

       3.      Is the exemption of point-of-sale advertisement for adult stores and tobacco
               outlets appropriate?

         The Administration's focus has been on preventing children and adolescents from using
tobacco products. Restrictions on the advertising that makes these products appealing to young
people is a vital component of these efforts. FDA's regulations exempt adult-only locations and
publications read primarily by adults because the evidence then available showed that advertising
in locations where children are never present, such as adult-only locations, or are rarely exposed,
as is the case with publications with an insignificant youth readership, would not have a
significant adverse effect on efforts to reduce youth tobacco use.

       4.      Is it appropriateto grant companies with greater cigarette market share
               additional point-of-sale advertising rights? If so, why? If not, why not?

       5.      Does such a privilege constitute a statutorily granted competitive advantage?
                If so, why? If not, why not?

       6.      Does the Administration support this grant? If so, why? If not, why not?

       7.      What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implementing the
               ban would the Administration propose? Please provide specifics.

        Section 10 1(d) would impose a general prohibition on the use of what is termed
"point-of-sale advertising" of tobacco products but would include a significant exception for
"adult-only stores and tobacco outlets." Sec. lOl(d)(2). The FDA regulations contain

                                                 5
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
 DRAFT 2-25-98 6:30 P.M.

  restrictions that are targeted at point-of-sale advertising, however, they are not as broad as those
  set forth in S.1414 primarily because they do not prohibit tombstone advertising. See 21 C.F.R.
  §§ 897.32, 897.16. The resources of the Administration are available to assist the Committee in
. crafting restrictions on point-of-sale advertising that avoid any significant constitutional concerns
  that the restrictions on point-of-sale advertising in S.1414 would raise.

        Section 101 (d)'s exception permitting manufacturers with a greater market share to
 engage in more point of sale advertising than their competitors appears inconsistent with the
 government's asserted interest in restricting such advertising. Granting manufacturers
 point-of-sale advertising opportunities consonant with market share is unrelated to the objective
 of reducing youth tobacco use; indeed, it may run counter to that goal. Moreover, the proposal
 presents constitutional and anti-competitive concerns that should be addressed. The resources of
 the Administration are available to assist the Committee in exploring those concerns.

 V.      LIMITATIONS ON POINT-OF-SALE ADVERTISING

         1.     What data does the Administration possess to suggest that such limitations will
                reduce smoking, particularly among youth?

         See response to IV .1., above.

         2.     Does the Administration support this provision? If so, why? If not, why not?

        The Administration supports appropriate restrictions on point of sale advertising, as
 evidenced by the FDA Tobacco Rule. As discussed above, its efforts have been focused on
 supporting the restrictions now codified in FDA regulations. The resources of the
 Administration are available to assist the Committee in determining whether further restrictions
 are constitutional and otherwise appropriate.


 VI.     BAN ON ADVERTISING RESTRICTION AGREEMENTS

         1.     Are such agreements currently against federal or state law? If so, is such a
                provision necessary?

         Ordinarily, under the free market system, retailers are permitted to decide from whom and
 to whom they will buy and sell, and on what terms. While an agreement of the sort described--
 between a manufacturer and a retailer to limit the ability of a competing manufacturer to display
 advertising on the retailer's premises -- might be anti competitive under certain circumstances,
 such agreements are usually not condemned under the federal antitrust laws. The
 Administration has not undertaken a review of state laws to determine whether such an
 arrangement would violate the law of any state.

       '2.    Does the Administration support such a provision? If so, why? If not, why
              not?

        The Administration's primary concern is not the relationship of retailers, manufacturers,
and distributors between or among one another with respect to advertising. Rather, the
Administration wants to ensure that point-of-sale advertising and promotional material, whatever
their source, consist only of black text on a white background.

       3.     Does the Administration support the limitation. If so, why? If not, why
              not?

       See answer to question 2 above.

       4.     What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implement the ban
              would the Administration propose? Please provide specifics.

       See answer to question 2 above.


VII.   GLAMORIZATION OF TOBACCO

       1.     What data does the Administration possess to indicate whether and to what
              extent this provision will reduce smoking, particularly among youth?

        A number of studies (Tye 1990; Terre, Drabman, and Speer 1991; Hazan, Lipton, and
Glantz 1994; Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down! 1997) show that depictions of tobacco use in the
entertainment media, particularly feature films, are on the increase and exaggerate greatly the
actual prevalence of tobacco use in the U.S. population. Research also suggests that adolescents
are highly susceptible to pro-smoking messages and images conveyed in entertainment media
(Signorielli 1993; Davies 1993; Basil 1997). Focus group research found that young people are
able to recall virtually no anti-smoking messages on TV or in the movies, yet they are able quite
readily to recall specific movies that portray smoking and to identify actors and actresses who
smoke in their entertainment roles (Mermelstein 1997). Deglamorizing tobacco use in the
entertainment media can be achieved both by decreasing pro-smoking cues and by increasing
anti-smoking cues. A study by researchers at the University of California at Irvine suggests that
anti-smoking ads before movies can help inoculate young people against the positive images of
smoking that appear in movies. Ninth graders who watched the movie "Reality Bites" (in which
the cast smokes in about one-third of the scenes) preceded by a California Department of Health
Services anti-smoking ad were much less likely to find smoking exciting compared with teens
who watched the movie without the counter-advertisement (Pechmann, 1996).

DRAFT 2-25-98 6:30 P.M.

       2.      What entity does the Administration propose will determine what activity
               constitutes promoting the image or use of a tobacco product?

       3.      How does the Administration envision such a ban will be enforced?

       4.    . Does the Administration support such limitations?

       5.      What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language would the
               Administration propose? Please provide specifics.

         In response to Questions VII.2 - VII.5, the Administration believes that the scope of the
restriction on glamorization in S. 1414 is unclear. For example, is the provision intended only to
restrict attempts to promote certain brand names of tobacco products or is it intended to restrict
the promotion of smoking generally? If the latter were the case, then the provision would appear
to reach some noncommercial speech, raising significant constitutional concerns. It is also not
clear what is meant by the use of the word "promoting." Finally, the phrase "appeals to .
individuals under 18 years of age" could be subject to challenge on vagueness grounds.

        Alternatively, no such constitutional concerns would be raised if Congress enacted
legislation that would confirm the authority of the FDA to regulate the advertising of tobacco
products through such indirect means as the use of product placement agreements.


VIII. RESTRICTIONS ON COLOR ADVERTISEMENTS

       1.      What data does the Administration have to substantiate that a ban on color ads, .
               except in publications with limited youth readership, will reduce smoking
               particularly youth smoking?

       See response to II.l., above.

       2.      Does the Administration believe that the threshold for the restriction of two .
               million readers is the appropriate threshold?

        FDA's tobacco rule requires that advertising be restricted to black and white text, except
in publications that are read primarily by adults or in adult-only facilities. The text-only
requirement is intended to reduce the appeal of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco advertising on
young people without unduly affecting the informational messages conveyed to adults.
Therefore, FDA proposed in its rulemaking that advertising in publications that are read
primarily by adults should be allowed to use imagery and color because the effect of such
advertising on young people should be nominal. The agency set the definition of adult
publication as those whose readers age 18 or older constitute 85 percent or more of the
publication's total readership, or those which are read by two million or fewer people under age

                                                8

DRAFT 2-25-98 6:30 P.M.

18, whichever method results in the lower number of young people. (Magazines with small
readership numbers but which appeal to young people may not attract two million young readers
but may still be primarily youth oriented; that is, 15 percent or more of their readers are under
18.) In addition, the agency noted that at some point, the number of underage readers is so great
that the publication cat?- no longer be considered to be of no interest to those under 18, regardless
of the percentage of the readership. For example, a magazine with a large total readership base
may attract as many as 5 million young people, or more, but those numbers would still not be 15
percent of the magazine's readership. See 60 Fed. Reg. 41335-36 and 61 Fed. Reg 44513-19.

       3.      How does the Administration envision readership demographics being
               determined?

        In its tobacco rulemaking, FDA explained that readership demographics would be
determined by measuring the total number of people that read any given copy of a publication.
Readership demographics would be measured according to industry standards and, at a
minimum, would be based on a nationally projectable survey of people. Two examples of
currently available surveys are Simmons's STARS and MediaMark Research Inc.'s (MRI's)
TEENMARK. FDA also indicated that it would be willing to work with industry on this issue.
See 61 Fed. Reg. 44516-19.

       4.      How would this restriction be enforced?

       The restriction would be enforced by the Food and Drug Administration and the
Department of Justice under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which
provides for the imposition of civil money penalties, 21 U.S.C. § 333(f), injunctive relief, 21
U.S.c. § 332, and/or criminal prosecution, 21 U.S.c. § 333(a).

       5.      Does the Administration support this restriction? If so, why? If not, why
not?

        The Administration supports the regulation in the FDA rule based upon the findings of
the Food and Drug Administration regarding the role and attractiveness of images and color in
advertising to young people. See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 44467-68, 44509 (1996).

       6.      What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implementing the
               restriction does the Administration propose? Please provide specifics.

       As discussed above, the Administration supports effective restrictions on the use of color
and imagery in tobacco advertising. The Administration urges Congress to provide statutory
confirmation of the existing authority of the FDA to regulate the advertising of tobacco products.

IX.    GENERAL QUESTION REGARDING MARKETING/ADVERTISING BAN

       1.      Can the marketing and advertising restrictions envisioned in the settlement
               be constitutionally imposed, with or without the industry'S consent? Please
               discuss.

         The answers to Parts I-VIII above address the government's authority to impose
restrictions on advertising and marketing without the industry's consent. As noted, we believe
that certain of those restrictions raise significant constitutional concerns. We address here the
degree to which "the industry'S consent" may affect the constitutional analysis of the advertising
restrictions.

         Voluntary commitments to restrict advertising are of course constitutional. For this
reason, we believe that the inclusion of such restrictions in state court consent decrees between
states and tobacco manufacturers -- rather than in federal legislation -- would significantly
increase the likelihood that the restrictions would be upheld if challenged in the future.
However, the inclusion of such restrictions in a federal statute that made adherence to such
restrictions a condition of the receipt of certain federal benefits would continue to raise
substantial constitutional questions. Such a statute, depending on how it were framed, could be
subject to substantial challenge under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. The resources of
the Administration are available to assist the Committee in crafting legislation designed to
minimize this potential problem.


X.     WARNING LABELS

       1.      Does the Administration believe that these are appropriate warning labels?

       The Administration supports the concept of strengthening warning label statement
requirements. Several recent studies (Health Canada 1996; Borland, Cappiello, and Hill 1996;
Robinson and Killen 1997) and literature reviews (USDHHS 1994; 10M 1994 ) are available
concerning the effectiveness of warning labels in conveying information to consumers. The
Administration's resources are available to help the Committee evaluate possible improvements
to warning label requirements.

       2.      Does the Administration possess data suggesting that these warnings will
               effectively reduce smoking, particularly youth smoking?

        See response to X.l., above.

       See response to X.l., above.

       4.     Does the Administration support the provisions authorizing specific new labels?
              If so, why? If not, why not?

       5.     What specific changes, if any, in the legislative language implementing this
              provision would the Administration propose? Please provide specifics?

       As stated above, the Administration is available to work with the Committee in
determining whether changes to the warning statement requirements are appropriate.


IX.           WARNING LABEL SIZE AND LOCATION REQUIREMENTS

       2.     Does the Administration support these particular specification? If so, why? If
              not, why not?

       3.     Does the Administration support the exception provided for flip-top cigarette

               youth?

        See response to X.l., above.

        2.     Does the Administration support the use of these alternative labels?

        3.     What changes, if any, to the legislative language implementing this provision

XI.     ENFORCEMENT OF ADVERTISING, MARKETING AND LABELING
        RESTRICTIONS

        1.     Does the Administration support the enforcement provisions regarding
               advertising, marketing and labeling? If so why? If not, why not?

         Section 114 of the bill provides FTC with the authority to enforce sections 111 and 112,
.the provisions relating to warning statement requirements. Section 114 also contains a penalty
 provision for violations of section 113, the requirement that companies provide ingredient
 information to the Secretary ofHHS pursuant to a new provision of the Federal Food, Drug, and
 Cosmetic Act, and authorizes the FTC to bring actions to enforce that provision. With respect to
 sections 111 and 112, section 114 appears to maintain the status quo with respect to warning
 label enforcement issues. Some other proposed bills would shift that authority to FDA. The
 Administration is .available to assist in the Committee in considering these differing approaches.
 With regard to section 113, which relates to a provision of FDA law, the Administration would
 be pleased to assist the Committee in evaluating whether enforcement authority for the ingredient
 disclosure requirements may be more appropriately vested entirely in FDA.

        2.     What changes in legislative language, if any, does the Administration
               recommend regarding these provisions? Please provide specific language.

        As discussed above, the Administration would be pleased to assist the Committee in
evaluating issues related to the enforcement of advertising, marketing, and labeling restrictions,
and in deVeloping modifications, if appropriate, to legislative language.

    . XII.   PREEMPTION OF STATE AND LOCAL ACTION

             1.     Does the Administration support such preemption? If so, why? If not, why
                    not?

             2.     What changes in legislative la~guage, if any, does the Administration
                    recommend regarding this provision? Please provide specific language?

             The Administration generally supports the limited preemption of state and local
     requirements related to the packaging of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco, but does not support
     the preemption of state and local restrictions on advertising. FDA's current regulations address
     advertising. Although the regulations are preemptive, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
     allows states and localities to apply for waivers to be exempted from federal thresholds. This
     would allow states and localities to enact or retain existing advertising restrictions that would be
     more stringent.

               The Administration is available to work with the Committee with respect to the broader
     issues of preemption raised by other provisions of the bill. The Administration is committed to
     allowing states and localities the maximum flexibility practicable to develop strong public health
     policies to prevent and reduce youth tobacco use.


     XIII. EXEMPTION OF EXPORTS

             1.     Does the Administration support this exemption? If so, why? If not, why
     not?

             The Administration strongly believes that comprehensive tobacco legislation
     should strengthen international efforts to control tobacco. The President indicated his
     support for this effort in his statement of September 17, 1997. This mOJlth the
     Administration also issued guidance to American posts abroad encouraging them to assist
     and promote tobacco-control efforts in host countries. The Administration looks forward
     to working with the Committee on this issue.

             2.     What ramifications does this provision have in the area of foreign relations?

XIV.   RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS

       1.      Does the Administration support these provisions? If so, why? If not, why
               not?

        The Administration supports access restrictions based upon FDA's findings regarding the
ability of persons under 18 to purchase tobacco products in the absence of a photo identification
requirement. See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 44437-39 (1996).

       2.      How does the Administration envision that this provision will be enforced,
               and can it be enforced effectively?

       FDA currently is enforcing aspects of its restrictions on youth access to tobacco products
embodied in the FDA tobacco rule (21 C.F.R.,§§ 897.14, 897.16). FDA is enforcing the age and
photo ID provisions cooperatively with state and local officials. Because of the enormous
number of retailers that sell tobacco, FDA has adopted a cooperative model. By way of
comparison, this is how FDA regulations are enforced for dairy farm and retail food inspections
in communities across the country-by commissioning the services of state and local officials.

         In its initial enforcement efforts, FDA contracted with 10 states. Under these contracts,
states are conducting between 200 and 330 unannounced retail compliance checks each month
over a period of eight months. Information about the compliance checks is sent to FDA, which
issues a warning for the first violation to retailers found selling to the adolescents. These
retailers will be subject to repeat inspections. FDA will seek a fine of $250 for the second
violation and greater fines for subsequent violations. FDA is in the process of contracting with
additional states.

         FDA anticipates that state and local contracts will provide effective mechanisms to check
compliance with other access restrictions, such as the requirement that all transactions be
face-to-face, without the assistance of any electronic device. Commissioned state and local
officials will be able to determine compliance with these and similar provisions by visiting
facilities, and appropriately documenting observations.

XV.     PROHIBITION ON SALE OF LESS THAN A FULL PACK OF CIGARETTES

        1.     Does the Administration support this prohibition? If so, why? If not, why
               not?

        The Administration supports this prohibition based upon FDA's findings regarding the
ability of persons under 18 to obtain cigarettes when they are sold in units of less than a full pack.
 See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 44443, 44445-48.                                                   .

        2.     What change in legislative language, if any, does the Administration
               recommend regarding this provision? Please provide specifics.

      \ The Administration does not recommend any changes in the legislative language.


XVI.    ST ATE LICENSURE TO SELL TOBACCO

        1.     What data, if any, does the Administration have to indicate that licensure
               will effectively reduce access to tobacco by minors?

         Licensure of retailers will give authorities the means of identify those retailers who sell
tobacco. States that do not require licensure are having difficulty complying with the Synar
amendment, because they have difficulty identifying outlets that sell tobacco products. In
addition to providing a list of retailers, the threat of license revocation for noncompliance is
extremely motivating to retailers. Furthermore, license fees can be used to cover the cost of
enforcement, which is an important determinant of compliance.

        2.     What entity does the Administration envision would enforce the licensure
               requirement if a state should be unable or unwilling to implement the
               licensure program?

        The Administration supports a licensing program that primarily operates at the state or
local levels. The Administration is available to work with the Committee on issues concerning
the relationship of such programs to federal standards or registration activities.

        3.     Has the Administration developed or formulated the cost of the licensure
               program? If so, why? If not, why not?

        The Administration has not completed work regarding the cost of a licensure program.

        4.     Does the Administration support the licensure program? If so, why? If not,
               why not?

        The Administration supports an effective licensing program. Federal legislation that
calls upon states to establish regulatory programs must be sensitive to federalism concerns.
Section 131 would provide·two incentives for states to establish licensing programs for retail
distributors of tobacco products. States that establish satisfactory licensing programs (1) would
avoid imposition of a federal ban on retail distribution of tobacco products within their borders;
and (2) would qualify for block grants under section 502. Congress possesses authority, under
principles discussed in New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 173-74 (1992), to "offer States
the choice of regulating that activity according to federal standards or having state law
pre-empted by federal regulation." Congress also possesses authority, under Spending Clause
principles discussed in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), to condition thereceipt of
federal funds by states on their implementation of certain regulatory measures. Accordingly,
although the section 131 incentives for state licensing may give rise to constitutional challenges,
we believe that they are consistent with the Constitution.

        5.     What changes in legislative language, if any, does the Administration
               recommend regarding this provision? Please provide specifics.

       The resources of the Administration are available to work with the Committee in
evaluating provisions for a licensing program.


XVII.          ANTI-TRUST EXEMPTION

        1.     Does the Administration support such an exemption? If so, why? If not,
               why not?

        The antitrust laws are the most important protector of the free-market economy against
anticompetitive actions that would undermine its integrity to the detriment of consumers.
Accordingly, exceptions to the antitrust laws should be made only in rare instances, when the
fundamental free market values underlying the antitrust laws are overwhelmed by a paramount
policy objective; and a proposed exemption must be necessary to permit the paramount policy
objective to be pursued. The proponents of broad antitrust exemptions -- for example, an
exemption that allowed companies to set prices jointly -- have not yet met this heavy burden.

        2.     Could such an exemption be used to set prices beyond those necessary to
               deter youth smoking, but to increase profits for the industry?

        An antitrust exemption that allowed tobacco firms to set prices jointly could be used by

profits at the expense of consumers. It would be very difficult to restrict use of the exemption to
its intynded purpose, because the tobacco companies would have both the opportunity and the
incentive to effect unnecessary price increases and to conceal them under the guise of restrictions
on youth smoking. While the resulting collusive price increase would be likely to reduce
demand for tobacco products, it would also increase profits for the tobacco companies, at least to
the point at which they are collectively charging the "monopoly price." The tobacco companies
would thereby be able to use an antitrust exemption to enrich themselves at the expense of those
confirmed with smoking habits.

       3.      What changes in legislative language, if any, does the Administration
               recommend regarding this provision? Please provide specifics.

        Before any exemption is considered for enactment, the proponents of the exemption need
to meet the burden of demonstrating that this is one of the rare instances in which the antitrust
laws are incompatible with a clearly paramount policy objective. The Administration is
extremely skeptical that the proponents of this case will be able to meet that burden, except
perhaps to support agreements to restrict advertising to children.

        Even in those rare instances in which that burden is met, any antitrust exemption should
be carefully and narrowly crafted to address that objective in the least anti competitive manner
available. If Congress should decide to move forward with consideration of antitrust
exemptions for the tobacco industry, the Administration would assist in crafting them as
narrowly and precisely as possible to achieve their purpose without creating unnecessary
anticompetitive effects.


XVIII. APPLICABILITY TO NEW ENTRANTS IN TOBACCO INDUSTRY

       1.      Under the agreement, and the implementing legislation, what is the
               assurance that new entrants into the tobacco industry will comply with the
               statute and any related consent agreements not to challenge the legality of the
               agreement implementation legislation?

        The proposed settlement and legislation do not deal expressly with new entrants into the
tobacco industry. It appears that new entrants would be treated similar to non-participating
manufacturers under Title VI and thus would be subject to advertising and access restrictions,
regulatory oversight, and the payment provisions, but would not receive the benefit of any
limitations on liability. There are no provisions in the legislation that would prevent new
entrants from challenging the constitutionality of the legislation.

                                               January 26, 1998



     Dear Mr. Chairman:

             The Clinton Administration looks forward to working with you and others in Congress to
     develop comprehensive, bipartisan legislation that will reduce teen tobacco use. In addition to
     the enclosed responses to your questions, we are prepared to provide the appropriate staff to give
     the Committee the technical assistance you request. We also are providing you with a number
     of resource documents cited below that we hope will be of assistance as you work to develop
     comprehensive legislation to protect our nation's children from tobacco related disease and
     death.

              As you know, the President has called on Congress to enact comprehensive legislation
     that raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years, gives the FDA full
     authority to regulate tobacco products, gets tobacco companies out of the business of marketing
     to children, furthers public health research and goals, and protects tobacco farmers and their
     communities. A piecemeal approach will not meet our overriding goal, which is to cut teen
     smoking.

              As part of such a comprehensive effort, the Administration has long recognized the
     importance of restricting the advertising and marketing of tobacco products to young people.
     Two recent studies underscore what we have said before -- that tobacco advertising aimed at
     young people is a significant factor in their decision to start smoking. Comprehensive tobacco
     legislation, espeeially if eemhiRea vl'ith eveR further 'IoluRtary agreemeRts to restriet aavertisiRg,
     is an opportunity for Congress to reaffirm FDA's efforts in this area.

             Many ofthe provisions included in S.1414 would codify the comprehensive regulations
     on nicotine-containing tobacco products that the FDA adopted in its final Tobacco Rule issued
     August 28, 1996. The FDA restrictions were carefully crafted on the basis of a multi-year
     investigation, and resulted from the analysis of myriad studies and research on the effects of
     advertising, specifically tobacco advertising, on young people and the consideration and analysis
     of more than 700,000 comments submitted in response to the proposed FDA rule. As you know,
     the Administration believes strongly that the FDA has jurisdiction and authority to issue such
     advertising restrictions and that comprehensive tobacco legislation should provide express
     statutory confirmation of this power.
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

         The Administration also believes, as the Department of Justice has explained at length in
the FDA litigation, that the FDA's regulations that restrict the advertising of tobacco products are
consistent, with the First Amendment, under the currently controlling framework for First
Amendment review of restrictions on advertising, set out by the Supreme Court in Central
Hudson Gas & E1ec. Corp. v. Public Servo Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557 (1980), and subsequent cases.
The FDA restrictions would, if implemented, substantially advance the Government's wholly
legitimate and compelling interest in curtailing minors' demand for and use of tobacco products
by reducing minors' exposure to tobacco product advertising. Moreover, the FDA's regulations
are tailored to serve this objective. For these reasons, we believe the advertising restrictions in
S.1414 that track the FDA regulations are constitutional.

        Other restrictions contained in S.1414 give rise to constitutional concerns that are not
presented by the FDA regulations, such as whether such restrictions would be sufficiently
tailored to serve the governmental interest in reducing teenage smoking. The enclosed
responses detail these eoneems constitutional issues. Such limits on advertising nonetheless
may be extremely valuable in reducing youth smoking and protecting the public health, and the
Administration onee again ehallenges the tobaeeo industry to adopt them voll:lntarily would like
to work with you and others to minimize constitutional difficulties.

        To assist the committee in developing legislation regulating tobacco products, including
legislation restricting the advertising of tobacco products, we have provided with this response
copies of the two documents which detail the analysis and findings on which the FDA
regulations are based: the FDA's proposed rule and preamble published in 60 Fed. Reg. 41314
(August 11,1994); and the FDA's final rule and preamble published in 61 Fed. Reg. 44396
(August 28, 1996). Our answers to your questions include citations to these documents where
appropriate. In addition, the FDA's administrative record contains the studies described in those
documents as well as public comments received by the agency. That record is contained on 5
CD's, which are also provided with this response.

        We hope this material is helpful and we look forwarCl to providing you and the members
of the Committee with any additional assistance that may be needed.



                                             Sincerely,




Enclosure
