TEXT:
Issued Letter That Clarifies That ADAD,s Obligates States to Offer
Appropriate Community Based Services. A recent court case D&Helen L. Vs.
DiDarioDB found that, because of the ADA, states must provide Medicaid
services in the D&most integrated setting appropriateDB to people with
disabilities. The Justice Department similarly found that the ADA
standard applies to the Medicaid program. Today, the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) is sending a letter all State Medicaid
Directors clarifying that states must assure that individuals living in a
facility have a choice to live the community if the right mix of support
services enables them to do so. This includes, home health aide services,
nursing services, medical equipment, and personal care services when
offering such services does not fundamentally alter the state program.
