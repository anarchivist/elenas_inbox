see attached.  I'm not surprised NGA is opposed -- but I still think we
should go ahead. Do you think we need a POTUS memo?

Subject:         Seat Belt Sanctions

According to Larry Magid, the Natl. Governors Assn. will be sending a
letter over later today asking that we drop the soft sanction provision.
NGA routinely opposes sanctions, preferring positive incentives.   (NEXTEA
already provides for a positive incentive; the soft sanction would be an
add-on.)   Even though 11 states have primary seat belt laws and some
governors have been outspoken in favor of them (Hunt, Glendenning), Larry
thinks they won't object to an NGA position opposing sanctions.

In view of this opposition (and we may hear from some other states' rights
groups), I assume we may want to send a decision memo to the President.  I
will draft one based largely on the DOT analysis I circulated earlier.
