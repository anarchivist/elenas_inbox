TEXT:
This event has finally gotten confirmed for April 9th (the anniversary of
the Cabinet meeting last year).   The VP will announce latest #s showing
we're on target for our goal of 10,000 (over 3,600 through 3/22), release
a very nice annual report highlighting lessons learned and accomplishments
in the agencies, and challenge companies who do business with the federal
government to do, their part. Likely participants: 1 Cabinet member
(probably Pena, whose been very aggressive about reaching out to contractor
s), 1-2 businesses, and one former welfare recipient. We're working with
Partnership to get 1-2 of their Board members to participate--it looks
pretty good.  We're highlighting the fact that Greenwald suggested at the
meeting wi VP, Erskine, and Bruce back in Novermber that the federal govt
should reach out to its contractors in the same way that United has
reached out to its suppliers (apparently he's thrilled that we took him up
on his suggestion).   This event will be an action item on the COS' call tom
orrow.  Each agency will be asked to identify 5 or more contractors they
will bring to the event, and identify either Cabinet or deputy to attend.
