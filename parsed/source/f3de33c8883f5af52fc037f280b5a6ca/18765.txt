TEXT:
On Monday I am returning to the Department of Education to run a promising
new initiative called the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration
Program.  The program will provide incentives for over 2,000 schools
around the country -- especially low-income, low-achieving schools -- to
adopt research-based, schoolwide improvements, and will help strengthen
the connection between this AdministrationD,s efforts to raise academic
standards and teaching and learning in the classrom.

I am grateful to have had the chance to serve here, especially during the
past year when education was such a top priority.  It has been a great
privilege to work alongside such a talented, hard-working bunch of people,
and for a President who knows and cares so much about education.  Thanks
to everyone who helped make my experience here worthwhile.

Beginning Monday you can reach me at 205-3849, or bye-mail at
William_Kincaid@ed.gov

Take care.

-- Bill
