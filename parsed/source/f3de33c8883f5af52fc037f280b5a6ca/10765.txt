TEXT:
Bruce, thanks for agreeing to call Ray Sheppach, Gov. Hunt, and ~ov.
Carper today regarding the NYT headline "Clinton to Urge More U.S. Control
on Aid to Schools." Please give me and Fred a report once the calls are
completed. I need to see the talking points that are put together on this
today as well.

I will invite Michael Cohen to join me, Fred, and Chris Jennings for NGA
/state DC reps briefing on SOTU tomorrow at 10:30am. The two hot issues I
anticipate are Tobacco recoupement and now Education mandates. In the Q/A
for education points, I think we need to address the question that will be
asked: So, if any state refuses to comply with the President's new
"mandate" what are the consequences?
