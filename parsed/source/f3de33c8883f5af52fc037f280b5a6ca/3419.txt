 Subject: Draft memo on expanding Defense Dept's CAP program

 If we want to push OMB to expand the DOD computer accommodations to the
 whole government, here is a draft memo explaining what the program is and
 why it should be expanded.  I know I can't make it happen by talking to
 OMB, so if we want to do it, we have to convine Frank/Jack or, more
 likely, get vicki to do something, given that Erskine made positive noises
 about it when he met with the appointees. At the moment, it's in the
 draft executive order.

    TO:                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

    FROM:

    As we approach the anniversary of the ADA, we would like to move forward on a good idea that
    has been floating around for some time -- expanding the Defense Department's "CAP" program.
    It has minor budget implications.

    The Defense Department's Computer Accommodations Program ("CAP") purchases equipment
    for DOD employees with disabilities to allows them to keep working if they become disabled, or
    for new employees just joining the workforce. By using a central $2 million fund for such
    purchases, individual offices do not have to bear the cost within their own budgets, and are less
    likely to be deterred from hiring a person with a disability. CAP is also able to get better prices
    on equipment through its bulk purchases and expertise. It has a showroom to help employees try
    out appropriate adaptive devices (CAP makes the decision on what equipment is purchased, not
    the employee). It has provided over 9,000 accommodations since its inception in 1990.

    This program is a good example of how employers and employees are taking advantage of new
    (and increasingly cheap) technology, such as computers for the blind that talk and listen, and
    alternative computer keyboards for people with dexterity problems, that allow people with
    disabilities to work.

    For some time, the Administration's appointees with disabilities have been pushing the idea of
    expanding the CAP program to cover all Federal employees, not just those at Defense. This is a
    particular priority for Tony Coelho, chair of the President's Committee on Employment of People
    with Disabilities. The idea was presented to Erskine when he met with the appointees several
    months ago, and he felt it was a promising idea.

    OMB staff believe that a centralized fund is unnecessary because agencies are already obligated
    under current law (Section 504 of the Rehab Act) to provide such accommodations today.
    However, many do not, and a centralized fund has many advantages.

    Defense has estimated that it would cost $8 million a year to expand CAP government-wide, but
    this is definitely overstated since CAP now serves the entire Defense Department for $2 million a
    year. A more realistic range is $2 - 5 million a year. While having DOD perform this service
    for all federal employees is a bit unusual, they have a great deal of expertise at this task and they
    are ready to take on the added responsibility.

    If we were to announce this in connection with the ADA, the appointees with disabilities would
    view this as a positive step but would not be exceptionally grateful for it, since they view it as
    overdue and are also hoping that we will be able to come to an agreement on an executive order
    on employment of people with disabilities. We are continuing to work on that possibility.
