PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
HMO ANNOUNCEMENT
THE WHITE HOUSE
OCTOBER 8, 1998

        For a generation, Medicare has been more than just a program; it
is the way we as a nation have honored our parents and grandparents -- and
protected our families.   Strengthening Medicare for the 21st Century has
been one of my aciministrationD,s top priorities.  Last year, we took
historic action to improve benefits and extend the life of the Medicare
Trust Fund to at least the year 2010. We also expanded coverage choices by
giving seniors the option of enrolling in managed care programs.

        Today, 6.5 million Medicare beneficiaries rely on HMOs for medical
care and treatment. But in recent weeks, some two dozen of these HMOs have
gone back on their word, announcing plans to drop Medicare patients by the
end of the year unless they are allowed to raise premiums and reduce
benefits. These decisions have brought uncertainty, fear and disruption
into the lives of more than 325,000 senior citizens all across America.
As they scramble to find new coverage, many will be forced to leave behind
the doctors and nurses they gotten to know in their HMOs. Still others
will have to stretch already-tight budgets to pay for needed prescriptions


covered by their old HMOs.

        These HMOs say they are just looking after their bottom line.
Well, r believe the health of our parents must be AmericaD,s bottom line.
r am determined to do everything in my power to make sure that no senior
dropped by an HMO is stranded without the medical care and coverage he or
she needs.  Today, we are taking three steps:

        First, we will do everything we can to ensure new HMOs quickly and
efficiently enter those markets abandoned by managed care. While the
overwhelming majority of seniors affected will be able to join other
Medicare HMOs in their areas, more than 30,000 Americans will be left
without a single Medicare managed care alternative.  Beginning
immediately, the Health Care Financing Administration, under the
leadership of Nancy-Ann Min, will give first priority in its review and
approval process to all HMOs applying to serve seniors in deserted markets.

        Second, r am asking Secretary Shalala to develop new laws to make
sure no one will ever have to suffer another disruption in coverage like
the one we are seeing this fall.  I am asking the Secretary to consider
all possible legislative solutions that can be included in the next budget
I send to Congress.

        Finally, I am launching a comprehensive public information
campaign to make sure all affected seniors understand the new options that
are already available to them. We will bring together a broad public and
private coalition -- from AARP to the AFL-CIO to the Social Security
Administration to local offices on aging -- to help seniors understand
that they are still eligible for the traditional fee-for-service program
as well as our Medigap policies.

         Protecting all Americans in an age of managed care is one of the
most important things we can do to strengthen our nation the 21st
century.   That is why I calIon this Congress to pass the important health
care legislation that is already on the table. We are literally out of
time.  In these last days before it adjourns, Congress must progress
before partisanship, and act decisively to protect the American people by
passing the PatientsD, Bill of Rights.

        More than thirty years ago, Congress was able to put progress
before partisanship, and passed the Medicare program.   The result:
Millions of older Americans have been able to live healthier and happier
lives.  It is one of the signal achievements of this century. Let us stay
on leave behind partisanship and stay on the path of progress to keep
America moving forward into the 21st Century.
