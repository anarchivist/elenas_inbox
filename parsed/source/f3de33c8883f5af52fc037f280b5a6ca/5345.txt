fyi -- Sperling is trying to set up a meeting on this for Friday.       Not

Gene wants to set up this meeting for this Friday and asked if Bob and
Mike would create a list of people who should attend.  (He mentioned
Raines and Riley).  Could you send us a potential list later today for him
to review? Thanks.
