It is mostly going through and changing 14% to 16%, and 50% increase to
doubling.  She also caught a typo on reaching 6 months by the year 2000.
I've found a couple of other additions or typos so I'd be happy to do a
new version.

We've talked to all the agencies (EEOC, HUD, DOL, Education, HHS, USDA
Transport) except Bill Lann Lee. Want me to call or you?
