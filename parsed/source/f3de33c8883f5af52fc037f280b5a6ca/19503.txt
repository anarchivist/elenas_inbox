Subject:         Senator Feinstein's Tobacco Concerns

Senator Feinstein called earlier today to express her concern with the
provisions of the McCain bill that preempt local governments from being
able to sue tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related Medicaid expenses
paid by those governments. The Senator would like our support for
reversing these provisions in our discussions with Senator McCain.
Additionally, she would like Bruce to call Louise Renne, the San Francisco
City Attorney at 415-554-4288 to discuss our position on this issue.
please call if you need any information.  Peter
