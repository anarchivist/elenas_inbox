                     KAISER PERMANENTE ANNOUNCEMENT

                            DATE:                 June 23, 1997
                            LOCATION:             Mar Vista Elementary School Playground
                            EVENT TIME:           4:30 pm - 5:35 pm
                            FROM:                 Bruce Reed

I.    PURPOSE

      To launch "Kaiser Permanente Cares for Kids," a program to spend $100 million over the
      next five years to cover uninsured children in California. This event will provide an
      important opportunity to highlight your commitment to secure children's health coverage
      as part of the balanced budget agreement and to outline your principles for any children's
      health legislation.

II.   BACKGROUND

      Kaiser Permanente Cares for Kids

      Kaiser is launching "Kaiser Permanente Cares for Kids," a program to help ensure that all
      children in California from birth through age 18 have access to health coverage within
      five years.

      1.     $100 Million Commitment

      Kaiser will spend $100 million over five years to provide coverage for uninsured
      children. Participants will receive the full range of benefits offered to other Kaiser
      enrollees, including preventive care and prescription drugs. Children will be enrolled in
      two ways. First, Kaiser will work with the California Managed Risk Medical Insurance
      Board to identify low-income families who work for small employers and whose children
      do not have insurance. Kaiser will provide subsidies to those families, averaging 50% of
      the cost of premiums. Kaiser expects that the rest of the premium will be shared by the
      employee and employer. Second, Kaiser will develop partnerships with schools
      throughout the state to provide subsidized coverage to low-income uninsured children in
      those schools. Kaiser will provide direct health services in a few schools in California.
      They will also reach out to some of the 630,000 children who are eligible from Medi-Cal
      (California'S Medicaid Program) but who are not enrolled.

      2.     Other Components of the Program



                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion




             Kaiser is supporting two pieces of legislation sponsored by Children Now to extend
             Medi-Cal coverage and to simplify the application and enrollment process. It is
             estimated that these two bills could reach 75% of uninsured children in the state.

             Finally, Kaiser is developing a coalition of other health plans, providers, advocacy
             groups, employers and government to expand private sector in children's health issues
             and to increase public awareness about the importance of this issue.

             Kaiser pledged to make this commitment at the Summit for America's Future.

             Status of Children's Health Proposals in Congress

             While the Chafee-Rockefeller children's health proposal did not pass, the debate around
             it improved the Chairman's mark notably. The final recommendation: (I) provides for a
             much more meaningful benefits package (an FEHBP-type model); (2) closes loopholes
             in which states would substitute new federal dollars for old state investments: and (3)
             ensures that the investment must be solely dedicated to coverage expansion and not
             services that will not decrease the number of uninsured children.

             The Senate Finance Committee also included a provision to increase the tobacco tax by
             $.20 and dedicate $8 billion of the total revenue from this tax to children's health. It
             looks as though the committee plans to spend this money on grants to states.

              These provisions will be debated on the Senate floor early next week. We are pursuing a
              strategy to improve the Senate Finance Committee package. First, we are working with
              the Republican leadership to ensure that the bill is consistent with the actual Budget
            . Agreement. Second, we are working with the Democratic Leadership to design
              amendments that could pass in the Senate TO further improve the package. The House
              is expected to bring up the companion legislation to the floor next week.

             To launch "Kaiser Permanente Cares for Kids," a program to spend $100 million over the
             next five years to cover uninsured children in California. This event will provide an
             important opportunity to highlight your commitment to secure children's health coverage
             as part of the balanced budget agreement and to outline your principles for any children's
             health legislation.
