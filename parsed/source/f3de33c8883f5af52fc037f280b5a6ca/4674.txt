       SCourt asks administration opinion on nurses for disabled students

           WASHINGTON (AP)   The Supreme Court today asked the Clinton
       administration whether it thinks public school districts must pay
       for nurses to accompany some disabled students throughout the
       school day.
           The court wants to hear Justice Department lawyers' view of
       rulings that require a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, school district to pay
       for the nursing services needed by a teen-age boy identified in
       court papers as Garret F.
           The justices are not expected to say whether they will grant
       full review to the Iowa case until hearing from the government
       lawyers, which could take months.
           At issue is the scope of the federal Individuals with
       Disabilities Education Act. The law provides that all children with
       disabilities receive a "free appropriate public. education. , ,
           Under the law, public schools are required to provide various
       "special education and related services. " But an exception is
       made for medical services.
           Garret, injured in a motorcycle accident at age 4, is a
       quadriplegic and ventilator dependent. His mental abilities were
       unaffected, and he is now in the ninth grade.
           During the school day, he requires a personal aftendant to see
       to his health-care needs. Through most of his schooling, a licensed
       practical nurse has served as that attendant.
           In 1993, Garret's mother asked the school district to pick up
       the costs of providing an attendant for Garret.
           She said such costs are to be free "related services" provided


under the federal law. But school officials said one-on-one nursing
services are medical, not educational, and do not have to be
provided at taxpayer expense.
    A federal trial judge and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled for Garret and against the school district.
    The appeals court relied heavily on a 1984 Supreme Court ruling
that said public school officials had to pay for and provide a
special procedure for a child disabled by spina bifida and unable
to urinate by herself.                   \
    Such services, the high court said then, "are no less related
to the effort to educate than are services that enable the child to
reach, enter or exit the school."
    But that 1984 opinion added: " I t bears mentioning that not even
the services of a nurse are required."
    In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Cedar Rapids
school officials noted that three other federal appeals courts have
ruled that schools don't have to pay for continuous services
provided by licensed nurses.
    The case is Cedar Rapids Community School District vs .. Garret
F., 96-l793.
