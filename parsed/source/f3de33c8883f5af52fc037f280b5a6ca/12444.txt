 TEXT:
 I spoke with Mike. He wasn't overly troubled by the langauge, but thought
 it was something that could be cleaned up in ED's drafting process. He
 asked me to let you know that Bill Taylor just called and said he would be
 sending over another social promotions draft. Mike will call you when he
 gets it.

 This is a good catch.  Tanya -- can you raise this with Mike and ask him
 whether he thinks we can reintroduce this issue into the conversation?
 Thanks.

 I just saw a copy of the latest langauge on social promotions that was
 distributed at yesterday's ED strategy meeting.  The section on page three
 that describes assessments reads:

  (D) Any assessment used by a State, local educational agency or school
  for purposes of implementing policy required by the subsection shall:

 (v) provide reasonble adaptations and accomodations for students with
 diverse learning needs.



    Bethany said that this section was not specifically discussed during
    yesterday's meeting. We wanted to highlight it because you had raised
    concerns during an earlier meeting about the meaning of "diverse learning
    needs".  I'm concerned about how using that phrase would broaden
    requirements for accomodations during assessments.  If it can still be
    changed, I would recommend using "students with learning disabilities."
