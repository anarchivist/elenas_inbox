TEXT:
We sent someone up to the Senate hearings.       Here's the report:

Lugar: favored buy-out at $8 a pound.        Favored a settlement but wanted to
protect farmers.

Helms: Mentioned positives of farmers and companies-- defended choice to
smoke. Stressed farmers be included. Mentioned Hugh Rodham.

McConnell: Emphasized importance of farmers in Kentucky.        Asked whether
farmers were mentioned in settlement.

Coverdall:    Emphasized danger of black markets.

Grassely: Wondered critically why President didn't have specifics on
farmers proposal.

No Dems around.


Comments you may have missed. B1i1ey saying he would hold hearings after
recess, and that there was no chance of enacting legislation this year.
Ford saying settlement would be defeated of its own weight.
