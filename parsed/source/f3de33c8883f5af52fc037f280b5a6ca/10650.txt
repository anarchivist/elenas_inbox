    TEXT:
    And here's a list of our welfare announcements overall:

    (1) Welfare caseloads have fallen below 8 million (down 43% since he took
    office and 35% since he signed the welfare reform bill)

    (2) 10,000 companies have joined the Welfare-to-Work Partnership,

    (3) The federal government has met our goal of hiring 10,000 welfare
    recipients by 2000 (we have to round slightly to get there)

    (4) The budget will include $1 billion more in Welfare-to-Work funds and
    to help those welfare recipients still on the rolls who face the greatest
    challenges get jobs and succeed in the work force, with a new emphasis on
    increasing the employment of low income fathers so they can better meet
    their responsibilities to their children.

    (5) Announce the availability of $240 million this spring for the third
    round of Welfare-to-Work Competitive grants focusing on individuals with
    the greatest challenges (substance abuse, low basic skills/ESL,
    disabilities)

    (6) 25,000 more welfare-to-work housing vouchers,

    (7) $150 million for Access to Jobs transportation,

    (8) $20 million for Individual Development Accounts,

 Here's an updated summary of case load numbers we sent speechwriters for
 SOU (I added a little more detail in the first paragraph for your
 purposes).  I'm faxing the state-by-state numbers and a spread sheet w/

Caseloads Continue Their Record Declines: New caseload data show the welfare rolls have
fallen below 8 million for the first time since 1969 and have fallen nearly 2 million since last
year's State ofthe Union. The welfare rolls have declined by 43 percent since January 1993,
when they stood at 14.1 million, and by 35 percent since their August 1996. The percentage of
the U.S. population on welfare is at its lowest in 30 years -- 2.9 percent (in 1968 it was 2.8 ).
The number of people on welfare is at its lowest in 29 years (in 1969 there were 6.7 million
people on the rolls). [Note: we're counting years through 1998 since that's when data is
from -- we could probably add another year if we wanted to count through 1999 since
that's when we're releasing the data]
