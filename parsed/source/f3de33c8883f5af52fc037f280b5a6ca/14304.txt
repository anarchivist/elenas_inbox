TEXT:
Good news for once -- SSA can revise the children's notice and
still make the deadline of Jan. 1. They have to finish it by noon
Friday.  I will work with them on the changes -- shouldn't be a
problem.
(By the way, the advocates know about the Friday meeting with us
and the commissioner, and are asking me about it.)
