Quality Commission Update. On November 20, we have tentatively scheduled an event for
you to accept the Quality Commission's "Consumer Bill of Rights" and announce your support .
for a Federal legislative approach (not necessarily an Administration-specific bill) that ensures
that the protections are real. In addition, we are working with HHS to determine if they can come
up with executive actions that illustrate our commitment to apply the Commission's
recommendations to Federal government programs. A great deal of public attention to the
consumer protections issue has been raised lately, largely as the result of memos associated with
the Republican Leadership (Senator Lott, Senator Nickles, Congressman Armey) that call on
their business and insurer allies to oppose Federal legislation in this area. A quote that suggests
that these industries "get off your butts and get off your wallets" has been attributed to Senator
Lott and Congressman Armey has been labeling any effort in this area to be "Clinton II." While
their strategy may be paying dividends with their target audience, the publicity around the memos
has not served the Leadership well. This is particular the case since 85 Republicans have joined
Congressman ~orwood (R-GA) in supporting legislation that goes far beyond what Quality
Commission will recommend to you. Having said this, the concern of the business community
about premium increases is growing, and we are going to have to position ourselves carefully on
this issue.

Medicare Commission Update. This week Senator Daschle announced that Senator Kerrey
and Senator Rockefeller will serve as his appointments to the Medicare Commission.
Apparently he decided to go ahead and make this announcement and forego any potential trade
for one appointments. Neither Congressman Gephardt nor the Republicans have announced or
even finalized their decisions for the Commission.

Children's Health Outreach Initiative. As you know, three million children are now
eligible and not enrolled in Medicaid. Many more children will be eligible but not enrolled
in the new children's health insurance program (CHIP). We have been meeting with
HHS, NEC and the First Lady's office to develop ideas for a major children's health
outreach initiative. Possible policy options could include: simplifying Medicaid eligibility
rules; distributing a model single application form for both programs; giving states access
to existing but now restricted funds
for outreach; and making it easier to enroll children at schools and child care referral
centers.
We are also considering other private sector outreach initiatives, such having businesses
who market to parents promote enrollment. Finally, we hope to form a public/private
steering committee that would continue to develop and encourage innovative outreach
efforts. This committee could include representatives from HHS, NGA, Americorps,
America's Promise, prominent non-profit foundations, provider groups, children's
advocacy groups. If you and/or the First Lady are interested, we could design a possible
event to announce this initiative.

Confirmation Update on Nancy-Ann Min DeParle and Dr. Satcher. We have been working
hard to encourage Senator Lott and other Republicans to allow for final confirmation votes for
Nancy-Ann Min DeParle to become HCF A Administrator and Dr. David Satcher for Surgeon
General. It appears that there is growing fear among Republicans that the Kyl Medicare private
                                                                       Hex-DiJmp Conversion
contracting amendment could backfire on them in this upcoming election year. As a result, we
are becoming increasingly confident that they will soon agree to vote on her confirmation. As
for Dr. Satcher, John Hilley continues to push Senator Lott to move on a final vote on the
Surgeon General as well. As ofthis writing, while we are increasingly optimistic, we have no
assurance they will vote on his confirmation before the Congress adjourns.
