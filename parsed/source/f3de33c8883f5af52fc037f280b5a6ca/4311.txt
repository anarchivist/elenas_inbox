              President Clinton's Plan for Comprehensive Tobacco Legislation


        Today, President Clinton challenged Congress to pass sweeping tobacco legislation to
reduce teen smoking. The President announced that he will invite Congressional leaders in both
parties to the White House in the coming weeks to launch a bipartisan effort to enact federal
tobacco legislation. That legislation will build on the extraordinary efforts of the nation's
attorneys general, who helped create an historic opportunity for progress in reducing smoking,
especially by youth.

       In August 1996, the Clinton Administration announced a landmark rule by the Food and
Drug Administration to protect children from the harm caused by tobacco products, which was
upheld by a federal judge in North Carolina earlier this year. Those victories for the public
health, along with the aggressive efforts of the attorneys general, drove the tobacco companies to
the bargaining table and extracted concessions from them that would have been unimaginable
just a short time ago.

        Since a proposed national settlement was announced June 20, the Administration -- led by
Vice President Gore, Bruce Reed, the President's Domestic Policy Advisor, and Donna Shalala,
Secretary of Health and Human Services -- has been working with the public health community,
the attorneys general, members of Congress, tobacco farmers, and others to develop a
comprehensive tobacco policy.

       Today, the President announced five key elements that must be at the heart of any
national tobacco legislation:

         1. A Comprehensive Plan to Reduce Teen Smoking, Including Tough Penalties If
Targets Are Not Met. Every day, 3,000 young people start smoking, and 1,000 of them will
die early as a result. The central goal of tobacco legislation must be a comprehensive, nationwide
effort to reduce teen smoking. The Administration is calling for:

       ·      Tough Penalties and Price Increases to Reduce Teen Smoking: The
              Administration believes tobacco legislation must include stiff penalties that give
              the tobacco industry the strongest possible incentive to stop targeting kids.
              Legislation should set ambitious targets to cut teen smoking by 30% over 5 years,
              50% over 7 years, and 60% over 10 years, and impose financial penalties that hold
              tobacco companies accountable to meet those targets. The Administration
              supports penalties that are non-deductible, uncapped, and escalating -- so that the
              penalties get stiffer and the price goes up the more the industry misses the targets.
               Reducing youth smoking is the Administration~s bottom line, and now it must be
              the industry's bottom line.

              One of the surest ways to reduce youth smoking is to increase the price of
              cigarettes. By some estimates, a 1 0% increase in cigarette prices will lead to a
              7% drop in youth smoking. Today, the President called for a combination of
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

               payments and penalties that could increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1_50 a
               pack over the next decade ifthe youth smoking reduction targets are not met.

       ·       A Public Education and Counteradvertising Campaign: To succeed in
               reducing youth smoking, legislation must provide for a nationwide effort to warn
               young people of its dangers, and to help parents keep their children from taking up
               the habit in the first place. The tobacco industry should be required to fund a
               substantial public education and counteradvertising campaign, as well as state and
               local prevention efforts. Today, the President also reiterated his call to the
               tobacco industry to stop marketing tobacco to children.

       ·       Expanded Efforts to Prevent Youth Access to Tobacco Products: The current
               FDA rule includes significant measures to reduce youth access, such as requiring
               retailers to check photo identification of anyone under 27, banning vending
               machines and self-service displays from establishments accessible to children, and
               eliminating free samples and the sale of single cigarettes. The Administration
               supports legislation to build on those efforts by imposing even stronger
               restrictions on youth access and establishing an effective retail licensing scheme
               with tough penalties.


         2. Full Authority for FDA to Regulate Tobacco Products. In 1996, the
Administration took the historic step of asserting FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products. The
Administration has long supported federal legislation to explicitly affirm the FDA's authority to
regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Under this legislation, the
FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as great as its authority over other drugs and
devices. The legislation should not impose any obligation on the FDA to make specific findings
about such speculative matters as the creation of contraband markets. Neither should the
legislation impose any special procedural hurdles or requirements, such as enhanced standards of
proof or unusual evidentiary formalities, on the FDA's regulation oftobacco products.


        3. Changes in the Way the Tobacco Industry Does Business. Federal tobacco
legislation must include measures to expose the industry's past misconduct, especially efforts to
market products to children, and to change the way the industry does business. Voluntary
commitments on the part of the industry -- such as agreements to limit advertising to children --
can indicate increased corporate responsibility. But legislation is needed to ensure that pattems
of corporate malfeasance are disclosed and effectively checked in the future.

        To this end, legislation must provide for broad disclosure of industry documents,
especially those containing scientific or other health information or relating to the industry's
attempts to market tobacco to children. This legislation should comport with essential principles
of attorney-client privilege. But the legislation should establish effective mechanisms to tum
over to the public all non-privileged documents (including documents the industry has falsely
claimed to be privileged), as well as to disclose all scientific and health-related information in
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
even privileged documents.

        Legislation also must require tobacco companies to set up comprehensive corporate
compliance programs that will reinforce the real economic incentives provided by the youth
smoking penalties (see above) to discourage companies from marketing to children. Further, the
legislation should establish oversight mechanisms to investigate and monitor corporate
compliance and to make recommendations to Congress on appropriate future legislation.


        4_ Meeting Other Public Health Goals. Federal tobacco legislation provides an
opportunity not only to reduce youth smoking, but to meet other public health goals: the
reduction of environmental (i.e., second-hand) tobacco smoke, the expansion of smoking
cessation programs, the strengthening of intema~ional efforts to control tobacco, and the
provision of funds for medical research and other health objectives.

        Federal tobacco legislation should include provisions to restrict smoking in workplaces
and other public facilities of the kind found in H.R. 3434, as well as in the President's recent
Executive Order on tobacco smoke in federal facilities. The best scientific studies show that this
measure would reduce the risk of death and injury to non-smokers, including hundreds of
thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illness, and would lead many smokers to
quit the habit.

       Legislation also should provide sufficient funds to enable smoking cessation programs
and services to reach and assist the millions of smokers who want to break their addiction to
tobacco products. Data suggests that some 70% of smokers want to quit, but less than 25% now
successfully do so.

         Legislation should strengthen the Administration's leadership role in global and bilateral
efforts to reduce smoking by providing assistance to international organizations such as the
World Health Organization. According to the WHO, tobacco use now causes 3 million deaths a
year worldwide; unless checked, that number will rise to 10 million by 2025, with 75% of annual
deaths occurring in developing countries.

        Finally, legislation should generate enough additional resources to establish a medical
research fund and further other important health objectives. The Administration believes that
tobacco legislation should be viewed primarily not as a means of raising money, but of
improving the public -- and especially our children's -- health. Nonetheless, tobacco
legislation should take into account the costs that the industry has wreaked on society. In
particular, the amount of money payable to the public cannot be decreased by the amount of the
excise tax imposed in the balanced budget.


        5. Protection for Tobacco Farmers and Their Communities. The President made
clear today that any tobacco legislation must protect tobacco farmers and their communities.
Most tobacco fanners have small, family farms; many ofthem have grown tobacco for


                                                                                          Automated Records Management Systerr
                                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
                generations. In some states, entire communities rely on income from the tobacco crop. The
                Administration is committed to working with members of Congress in both parties to ensure that
                we protect the financial well-being of tobacco fanners, their families, and their communities.
