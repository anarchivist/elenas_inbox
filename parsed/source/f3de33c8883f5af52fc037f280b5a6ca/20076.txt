        Tobacco Legislation and the House Minority Caucuses. Next Monday, DPC, OMB, and
        HHS will meet with respresentatives of the House Minority Caucuses to discuss the provisions
        they wish to be inserted into any tobacco legislation. Working out an acceptable aggreement
        with the Members of the Caucuses is critical to ensuring their support for the overall tobacco
        initiative. We are already hearing that they have grave concerns about the Senate version of the
        tobacco bill, particularly as it relates to provisions that block grant the prevention and cessation
        investments. As you know, this community has a long-standing mistrust toward the states and
        the use of block grants. They are also upset that there are no specific investments for
        Historically Black and Hispanic Colleges and Universities and Medical Schools. Their current
        alternative raises some significant constitutional and administrative concerns that we must work
        through. More specifically, their language has set-aside oriented language that may run afoul of
        the Adarand Supreme Court decision and their funding allocations would alter the investment
        agreements we have worked out with Senator McCain, as well as create major administrative
        burdens for HHS. We anticipate that Monday will be the first in a series of drawn out
        discussions designed to reach an acceptable compromise.
