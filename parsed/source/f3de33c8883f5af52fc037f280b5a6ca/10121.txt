      Subject:         Senior Staff Coverage for Thursday, November 26, 1998

      Once again I will be collecting information on the Senior Staff coverage,
      on-call and in-office,  for the upcoming Federal Holiday, Thursday,
      November 26, 1998 which will then be forwarded to the Chief of Staff's
      Office.  Please submit this information to me no later than COB on.
      Tuesday, November 24, 1998.

      Please remind any staff members who plan to take off time for the holiday
      that they are required to take annual leave for those days that are not
      the federal holiday.

      Also remember to provide WHCA Signal Switchboard and the Operator with
      contact phone numbers.

      As always, many thanks.
