TEXT:
Here are what I think are our three best ideas.  If you'd like them put in
a more formal event style memo, please let me know:

Early or mid-July: The President could release the new caseload numbers,
showing that case loads have declined by 3 million since he became
President and the number of people on welfare has fallen to less than 11
million. This could be done in one of many venues. He could visit a
successful welfare to work program; he could call a meeting of his
economic advisers to report to him that the economy is producing enough
jobs for welfare recipients; he could announce it at the top of a news
conference or a bipartisan meeting of the Congressional leadership.

July 28: Speech to National Governors Association. The President would
use this speech to highlight what's worked in welfare reform around the
country and to challenge the governors to put in place the incentives and
supports (child care, transportation, etc.) to ensure people to go to
work.  The President could announce the new child care regulations here.

Mid-August (14 or IS?): Welfare to Work Partnership.  The President would
highlight successful efforts to move welfare recipients to work by joining
with business leaders in a city where companies are hiring a signficant
number of people from the welfare rolls.  Eli Segal has recommended St.
Louis, Indianapolis, Columbus, or Baltimore.  The event would help
symbolize the efforts underway in the year since the President signed
welfare reform into law (8/22/96).
