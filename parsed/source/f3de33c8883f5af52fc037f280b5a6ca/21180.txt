Outline

Introduction/Context

       ·       Continuing Racial disparities and discrimination exist in the economy as a whole
               and within cities:

               (1)     Wage disparities, higher levels of unemployment, and low net wealth
                       consistently shortchange large numbers of racial and/or ethnic minorities.
                       Employment discrimination affects a significant number of all job
                       searches.

               (2)     Concentrated poverty and racial segregation constitute major barriers to
                       the reduction of place-based racial disadvantages.

       ·       Building One America requires developing economic equity and opportunity
               programs that treat Americans of all races fairly. To do so, we must develop
               long-term, comprehensive programs linking the public and private sectors in
               rebuilding the economies of minority communities and increasing opportunities
               for economic advancement for all.

       ·       The following are some broad themes as well as potential approaches:




                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                  1


       A.      Employment Opportunities: Strengthen Polices which Increase Employment Rates
               for Minorities

               1.     Target job creation in low income and minority communities

                      a.      Incentives to private industry for job creation in low income and minority
                              communities and creation of public service jobs where necessary.

                      b.      Incentives for employers to hire disadvantaged workers (such as the
                              long-term unemployed).

                      c.      Infrastructure improvements in urban and rural low income and minority
                              areas, including remediation and development of brown fields.

               2.     Ensure that individuals acquire the skills required by the marketplace, particularly
                      young people.

               3.     Improve access to jobs.

                      a.      Link low-income and minority workers to areas of job growth
                              through innovative transportation programs (like DOT's Job
                              Access program).

                      b.      Improve the flow of information to minority communities about
                              job opportunities in areas of high growth.

                      c.      Improve access to child care for low-income and entry-level
                              workers.

               4.     Vigorously enforce fair employment laws, including those affecting public
                      sector employment.

       B.     Strengthen Policies Which Ensure That All Families Earn a Living Wage So That
              No Family with a Working Parent Must Live in Poverty

               1.     Increase the minimum wage.

               2.     Support enforcement of worker protections including wage and hour and
                      equal pay laws.

                      workers.
               4.     Increase the availability of affordable, quality child care for low and
                      middle-income working families.

                                                  2              Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


               5.     Expand health insurance coverage for low and middle-income working
                      families and assistance to enable people with disabilities to work.

               6.     Encourage life-long learning and skills upgrading.

               7.     Increase child support enforcement.

               Affordable Housing

               1.     Increase fmancial support for individuals to purchase and/or rehabilitate
                      housing (through tax incentives, direct spending, individual development
                      accounts, etc.).

               2.     Increase financial support for access to decent, affordable housing for
                      renters.

                      b.      Further develop regional housing counseling and referral agencies.

               3.     Aggressively enforce fair housing and fair lending laws (e.g., through the
                      use of pattern and practice investigations, disparate impact cases and
                      increased testing); enhance enforcement and/or strengthen laws that
                      promote access to mortgage loans for minorities (e.g., ECOA, the Home
                      Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act).

               4.     Integration

                      a. Support voluntary efforts to establish and maintain economically and
                         racially integrated communities, including incentives to public housing
                         agencies to reduce the concentration of housing assistance recipients in
                         high-poverty areas and promote more dispersed housing choices.

                      b. Increase regional housing counseling efforts to encourage low-income
                         and/or minority families to consider a wider more diverse range of
                         neighborhoods when they make their housing decisions.

                      b. Promote distressed communities as a new frontier for retail and
                         financial institutions, so that we bring capital and jobs back to these
                         communities.

                      c. Enforce the fair lending laws (see above).

                      d. Increase support for financial institutions focusing on these

                      communities, such as through un-banked initiatives.

               3.     Link aggressive civil rights enforcement to urban revitalization by
                      structuring settlements to develop affected communities; press for more
                      aggressive systemic investigations which would promote revitalization as
                      part of the case settlements.
