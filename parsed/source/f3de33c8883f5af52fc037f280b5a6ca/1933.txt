SUMMIT DECLARATION    DRAFT 4/23/97



 Two centuries ago, America was founded on the proposition that just as
all people are endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights,
citizenship entails undeniable responsibilities. As each of us has the
right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, each of us has an
obligation to give something back to country and community   a duty to
take responsibility not just for ourselves and our families, but for one
another. We owe a debt of service to fulfill the God-given promise of
America   and of her children.

 In this time of opportunity   at the dawn of a new century and a new
millennium   the need for shared responsibility is self-evident.

People of all ages and from all walks of life must claim society's
problems as their own   pulling together, leading by example, and
lifting
American lives. The challenges of today, especially those that face our
children, require a special commitment of us all.

 We have a special obligation to America's children to see that all
young
Americans have:

caring adults in their lives, as parents, mentors, tutors, coaches;

safe places with structured activities in which to learn and grow;

a healthy start and healthy future;

an effective education that equips them with marketable skills;

an opportunity to give back to their communities through their own
service

 We therefore highly resolve to work together   to be champions of youth
  to ensure these fundamental resources for all of America's children.
 We will do so through citizen service, through voluntary action,
through
commitments by ourselves and the organizations to which we belong,
through partnerships spanning both public and private life, but above
all
as one community.
