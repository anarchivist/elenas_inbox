TEXT:
I'm not advocating, I just came upon this:
"Would Ratings Work?: The head of the organization representing the
nation's
leading concert promoters said Monday that proposed mandatory ratings
systems
 for music performances--akin to movie ratings--would be "unworkable" and
"unenforceable." "I'm not opposed to anything that would help people
decide to
go to concerts if it's something that reassures parents and it's
workable," says
Cynthia Wallace, director of the North American Concert Promoters Assn. "I
just
can't imagine how it would be enforced.      . Suppose controversial singer
Marilyn Manson says, 'Yeah, I'll do a PG show,' and it turns out to be R,
what
are the sanctions?" Ideas for various concert rating systems are being
raised by
several state legislators around the nation. Under fire from parents
groups and
legislators in the late '80s, the music industry voluntarily adopted a
program
affixing warning stickers to recordings with explicit lyrics, though no
laws
were enacted restricting sales of such material." [Los Angeles Times,
