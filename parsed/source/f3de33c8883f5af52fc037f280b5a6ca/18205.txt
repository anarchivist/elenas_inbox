TEXT:
FYI.  Sally Katzen's office called to ask about process for the EEOC
suggested structural reform.  They've gotten letters from 30 agency EEO's
with concerns.  I've said we wanted to be able to announce this for the
SOTU.  They would like to vet this through non-eeo types at the agencies.
I said if Sally K. thinks that is necessary, its their area of expertise,
but we still are looking to get this done in time.
