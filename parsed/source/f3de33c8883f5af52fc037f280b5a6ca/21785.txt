TEXT:
Larry may have spoken to you already, but he asked me to drop you and Ann
a note. With Peter Jacoby gone, I will be handling campaign finance.    If
you need help on the substance, I would be happy to do anything I can.   I
practiced campaign finance law for the better part of 10 yrs and taught
campaign finance at Georgetown Law School.

Let me know what you need.    Thanx.
