TEXT:
I will be at NBAC's cloning meeting in Virginia from 7:30 to noon tomorrow
and reachable by page or at 703-486-1111 (ask for National Bioethics
Advisory Cmt. mtg.)   I am planning to skip our pediatric labeling call.
Elena, if you'd like me to call in from the mtg, just have Laura page me.
Thanks.
