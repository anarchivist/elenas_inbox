                    Questions and Answers on 1996 NAEP Science Results
                                 DRAFT -- October 21, 1997

Background: Today, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) released a
performance report on the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in
science, showing that less than 30% of U.S. students reach proficient levels of scientific
knowledge and understanding, with 29% reaching the proficient level at grades 4 and 8, and 21 %
demonstrating proficiency at grade 12. The basic level -- representing partial mastery of
fundamental knowledge and skills -- was reached by 67% of students in grade 4, 61 % in grade 8,
and 57% in grade 12.

NAEP is a representative sample test that gives information on how the U.S. and over 40 states
are doing at the state and national levels, but provides no information for individual students and
their families. The 1996 science NAEP was developed from a new content framework, so results
cannot be directly compared to previous assessments. Achievement is reported based on levels
for basic, proficient and advanced performance approved by NAGB in August.

Q: Why don't U.S. students perform better on this test?

A: These tests are very challenging, but U.S. students should do better on them, and the results
are a strong indication that we have a long way to go. States and school districts must continue
to raise their expectations for student achievement in science, adopt rigorous curricula and
materials, and make sure teachers get the preparation and training they need. Parents and
schools must encourage students to lay a strong foundation for later achievement by taking the
toughest math and science courses possible. The President's proposed voluntary national tests
will help as well, focusing the attention of communities on helping students master the basics of
reading and mathematics, both of which are abolutely essential for students to excel in science
subjects.

Q: It appears that U.S. students do worse the longer they stay in our educational system.
Is that accurate?

A: It's true that the proportion of students attaining at least the basic level is lower for 12th grade
than it is for 4th grade,but this doesn't mean that older students know less science. The
achievement levels for the science assessments are set separately for each grade, and the tests
have few questions in common. What the numbers do mean is that fewer 12th graders met
NAGB's standards for 12th grade peformance than 4th grade students met standards for 4th
grade performance. The bottom line is that we need to improve curriculum and instruction at all
grades.

Q: How can it be that the U.S. is second in the world on the TIMSS 4th grade science test
and yet such a large proporation of our students don't even reach the basic level?

A: These results are an indication that the NAEP science tests are genuinely challenging.
While TIMSS shows that average U.S. performance is high relative to other countries, NAEP
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

shows that there are still many students attaining low perfonnance levels. If the U.S. is going to
maintain, or improve its position in future intermationaI comparisons, more and more U.S.
students will need to reach higher achievement levels on the rigorous U.S. NAEP science test.
