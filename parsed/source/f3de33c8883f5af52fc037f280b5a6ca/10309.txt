TEXT:
Just a heads up that there may be press tomorrow about new 97 teen
pregnancy data in a report in Pediatrics.  In fact, the report references
97 teen birth data that National Center for Health Statistics already
released in October. The most recent pregnancy "data is still 1995.

On a related note, I learned that NCHS is close to releasing a report
(probably mid to late next week) with more in-depth analysis of recent
teen birth trends, including trends by race/ethnicity and by state.   It
sounds like good news -- continued drops in all states and for all racial
groups.  I should get more info in the morning and will keep you apprised.
