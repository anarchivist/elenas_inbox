PLEASE REVIEW DRAFT LETTER BELOW AND PROVIDE COMMENTS BY 3:00 p.m. today,
Tuesday, June 9th.  (The bill is        scheduled for full committee
markup tomorrow morning.)

DRAFT
JUNE 9, 1998
10:45 AM


Honorable William Goodling
Chairman, Committee on Education
     and the Workforce
United States House of Representatives
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing to express my strong opposition to H.R. 3189, the so-called
"Parental Freedom of Information Act." This bill. would place new and
unwarranted burdens on teachers and schools across the Nation, impose a
one-size-fits-all solution to a problem that hasn't been shown to exist,
and create a great deal of litigation for school districts over issues
that should be handled through other means in accordance with State and
local laws.

H.R. 3189 would amend section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act
(commonly known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or


"FERPA") to:   (1) require elementary and secondary schools that receive
funds from the Department of Education to permit parents to inspect
instructional and testing materials within 30 days of their asking to do
so; (2) allow parents whose right to inspect these materials is violated
to sue for "appropriate relief." including attorney fees; (3) bar the
award of Department funds to any "educational agency or institution"
(apparently including colleges and universities) that, in carrying out a
Department-funded program, fails to get the parent's written consent
before requiring a student to undergo medical, psychological, or
psychiatric tests ·or treatments, or to reveal any information about the
student's personal or family life; and (4) reduce, from 45 to 30 days, the
current FERPA deadline to provide parental access to their children's
educational records.

None of these provisions is needed, and at least some of them would be
harmful.  Federal law (section 445 of GEPA) already provides specific and
adequate protection of pupil and parental rights relating to parental
inspection of instructional materials and requires parental consent prior
to a school's obtaining certain sensitive information from students.
These current protections are working well and do not need to be
supplemented by burdensome new requirements, such as the bill's provisions
inviting countless lawsuits and claims for attorney fees that would end up
being paid by the taxpayers.  Simply put, there is no need for the Federal
Government to impose these detailed and onerous requirements on our State
and local school systems.

I am also concerned that the bill's new provisions on parental consent
could, in some instances, work to deny appropriate and timely services to
children with disabilities.   The Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (IDEA), which was amended just a year ago with overwhelming bipartisan
support, specifically permits school districts, if they follow certain
steps, to conduct initial evaluations of children who may be eligible for
IDEA services (and necessary periodic reevaluations of children who are e
ligible) when parents refuse to provide consent, except where that would
be inconsistent with State law on parental consent. The IDEA also allows
school districts to conduct reevaluations without parental consent when
the parents simply fail to respond to reasonable efforts by the school
district to obtain their consent.  If H.R. 3189 were enacted, it could be
read to override the IDEA provisions and result in the loss of services to
children who need them and would otherwise qualify for them.

I urge the Committee to leave Federal law alone in these areas and not to
approve H.R. 3189.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
the submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's
program.

                                                  Yours sincerely,




                                                  Richard W. Riley


[Note to Executive Branch reviewers:  the relevant text of current law is
attached for your information.  It will not be attached to the letter when
transmitted.)

applicable program shall be available for inspection by the parents or
guardians of the children.

         (b) No student shall be required, as part of any applicable

embarrassing to the student or his family;
                  (3) sex behavior and attitudes;
                  (4) illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating and demeaning

                 (7) income (other than that required by law to determine

assistance under such program),

emancipated minor), or in the case of an unemancipated minor, without the
prior written consent of the parent.

        (c) Educational agencies and institutions shall give parents and
students effective notice of their rights under this section.

        (d) ENFORCEMENT. The Secretary shall take such action as the Secretary
determines appropriate to enforce this section, except that action to
terminate assistance provided under an applicable program shall be taken
only if the Secretary determines that--
                 (1) there has been a failure to comply with such section;
and
                 (2) compliance with such section cannot be secured by
voluntary means.

         (e) OFFICE AND REVIEW BOARD. The Secretary shall establish or designate

to determine if the child qualifies as a child with a disability as
defined in section 602(3) (A) or 602(3) (B) shall obtain an informed consent
from the parent of such child before the evaluation is conducted.

                                 (ii) REFUSAL.   If the parents of such child refuse c

consent inconsistent with State law relating to parental consent.
