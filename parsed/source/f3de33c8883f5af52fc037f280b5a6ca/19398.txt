TEXT:
Jen and I understand that at Erskine's Thursday scheduling meeting, there
will be a discussion of the POTUS scheduling request for a WH event on
October 23rd highlightling the release of the final report of the Treasury
Working Group on Child Care. Our understanding is that on the 23rd the
President has many hours of meetings scheduled with a foreign head of
State, and there is some question as to how this event will fit in.

On our scheduling request, we had suggested the late morning for this
event, as the CEOs on the Treasury Working Group are scheduled for their
working meeting with Rubin at 10:30am. We had hoped that just following
this meeting, we could have the public event at the White House.
Apparently, the Treasury Department had a great deal of difficulty finding
a date and time that worked for the various CEOs and others on the working
group, and we would like to stick to this time-frame.  On the other hand,
if an alternate time works for the President and the First Lady on that
day, the Treasury staff could go back to the CEOs.  So while the date is
unchangeable, there may be some flexibility with the time, just fyi.

Attached, also fyi, is the scheduling request.==================== ATTACHMENT        1
