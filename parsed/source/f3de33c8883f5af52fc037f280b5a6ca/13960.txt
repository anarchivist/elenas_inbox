TEXT:
Cheryl -- DOJ drafted the following letter about the constitutionality of
minority districts. Assuming that this is one of your areas of expertise, I'm
wondering if you can take a look at the draft and let me know if it's okay for
Presidential signature.
thanks for your help.
Jeff
Thank you for your letter on behalf of the Baptist Ministers
Association of Houston and Vicinity. I appreciate knowing your
views regarding the legal challenges to redistricting plans drawn
after the 1990 census.
The protection of voting rights over the past thirty years and
the resulting increase in minority representation has been a
testament to our enduring democracy. As you noted, the
communities that were once shut out of the process have brought
new leadership to all levels of our government, including the
halls of Congress. Your congressional district alone has
contributed distinguished leaders like Barbara Jordan and Mickey
Leland, and is now well represented by Congresswoman Sheila
Jackson Lee.
My Administration remains committed ensuring every American the
opportunity to cast an effective and meaningful ballot, free from
racial discrimination. We have ~trongly defended racially fair
redistricting plans against claims of unconstitutionality, and
will continue to do so in concert with the Supreme Court's new
legal standards. In addition, the Justice Department is
participating in the Texas congressional case to ensure any
changes in the law will still provide minority voters equal


opportunities to elect candidates of their choice.
The recent decisions of the Supreme Court have understandably
created a great deal of anxiety among the constituents of these
districts and others. However, these rulings do not signify that
states can abandon their obligation to ensure fair representation
or that the Justice Department will cede its responsibility to
enforce the Voting Rights Act with vigor and tenacity.   Instead,
we must redouble our efforts to guarantee an open .political
process for all Americans and rededicate ourselves to the ideals
of equal access and participation that inspired the original
passage of the Voting Rights Act.
Thanks again for writing.
