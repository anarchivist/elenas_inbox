NOTE FROM RICHARD SOCARIDES:

As most of you are aware, the Servicmembers Legal Defense Network will be
releasing a report on Wednesday highly critical of DOD's implementation of
"don't ask, don't tell." According to the report, discharges of gays are
up 42% since the change in the policy, which in theory was suppose to make
it easier for gays to serve. A similar report last year showed discharges
up 21%.   Last year, after the report appeared on the front page of the
NYT, DOD said they would investigate, but it does not appear there was
much follow-up.

Laura Marcus has been working with DOD and they appear prepared to say (we
think) that they are taking the report seriously and will evaluate the
allegations, take appropriate action, etc. David Johnson will be calling
over there tonight and hopefully any combative language can be avoided --
although this is a work in progress.

In the meantime, here are some proposed talking points for WH use.

You can call me with comments at 6-1611.



DRAFT TALKING POINTS: SLDN REPORT ON GAYS IN THE MILITARY

-- The "don't ask, don't tell" policy, developed in concert with the armed
services and Congress,
recognized that many gay and lesbian Americans have served and continue to
serve in the military with bravery and distinction.


       The policy was intended to provide an opportunity for continued service
    to those willing to abide by the new policy.

       While we have not had an opportunity to review the report, the
    allegation that the policy is not being implemented fairly, if true, is
    quite troubling.

    -- We understand that Secretary Cohen has instructed his staff to
    investigate the allegations and any other relevant information to
    determine what is happening."

    -- We further understasnd that Secretary Cohen has indicated that
    violations of either the letter or the spirit of the policy will not be
    tolerated and the President, of course, concurs in this judgment.
