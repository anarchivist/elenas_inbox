TEXT:
Not much was decided at today's 2pm message meeting.  However, the biggest
concern was finding a substantial domestic announcement for Tuesday, June
1, the President's first real day back after vacation and Memorial Day.
Doug wanted NEC and DPC to look at something "that touches real people".
Nothing raised at the meeting really raised to the level they are looking
for.

I will continue to poll the staff for new event ideas, but I assume this
will all come up either tomorrow morning or at the Chief of Staff
scheduling meeting at 10:00am tomorrow.  Let me know if there are any
ideas you know of that you would like me to explore.

Thanks.
