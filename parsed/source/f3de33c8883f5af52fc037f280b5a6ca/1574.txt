TEXT:
Just had a useful meeting with summit PR/ad people and our
communications/press people about what they're doing and how we can
participate. Weirdest moment came after Don pointed out that the headline
on their giant 2-page ad refers only to children, not to service (or even
voluntarism).  Powell's guy and the summit CEO insisted that the topic of
the summit is children, not service/voluntarism. A bit of a middle ground
emerged in discussion, but not exactly a meeting of the minds.

FYI, in case it affects your decision on whether to go, I hear that Don
and Ann will attend today's meeting with Sylvia (now scheduled for 5:45
today) .

Finally, are you interested/amenable to doing some press on the summit in
the coming weeks? They have a TV/radio station constantly available, and
we promised them lots of names of people who could do interviews with
local markets.   (We will go through the lists of names we collected for
task force recommendations to find other names; we also thought of asking
George, since he brings some celebrity to the table.)
