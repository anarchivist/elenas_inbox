TEXT:
Two of our friends in the legal immigrant advocacy community (Josh
Bernstein of the National Immigration Law Center and Michael Hill of
Catholic Charities) called me tonight to:

1) Express their dismay over the GOP conferees choosing the House
provisions over the Senate provisions. They said some of their allies
will likely denounce the move. Apparently an organization of Soviet Jews
will be in town Wednesday and Thursday this week.

2) They put on our radar screen that it if somehow we do not enact a
reconciliation bill before the August recess, Congress will need enact a
temporary extension of SSI and Medicaid benefits. They said notices will
go out September 8th for cut-offs October 1st, so to avoid unnecessary
panic among legal immigrants, a temporary extension would need to happen
before the August recess or immediately thereafter.
