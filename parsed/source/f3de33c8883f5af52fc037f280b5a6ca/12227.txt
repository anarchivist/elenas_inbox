TEXT:
Here's information requested at this morning's staff meeting (maybe more
than you wanted, but i t ' l l help us to have this all in one place).

INDICATORS
There are three different indicators for births to unmarried women:
1) Number of births to unmarried women
2) Rate of births to unmarried women per 1,000 unmarried women aged 15-44
3) Percent of all births that are to unmarried women

·AVAILABLE DATA
 We currently have national data from 1975 through 1997 preliminary figures
 on all three indicators, including breakdowns by age and race.  State
 level data through 97 (preliminary) is available for the number and
 percent, but not the rate.  Preliminary 97 data were released in October
 1998. Final 97 data are being finalized now and should be ready by end of
 the month. We understand the final data for out of wedlock births will
 look pretty much the same as the preliminary data. These data are included
 in a comprehensive NCHS report on Births and Deaths, which includes
 information on teen birth rates, use of pre-natal care, HIV-related deaths
 etc. We're talking to Melissa about timing and strategy for releasing
 these various data -- there was some thought of releasing the teen birth
 data to coincide with the Campaign for Teen Pregnancy Prevention's events
 on April 28th and 29th.

NATIONAL TRENDS
1) as the table below shows, the number peaked in 1994 at 1.29 million,
after increasing every year since 1975.   It fell 3% from 94 to 95, then
increased slightly in the next two years.   It does appear that the number
is leveling off.

2) the rate peaked in 1994 at 46.9 after increasing every year since 1975
 (w/ the exception of a slight downward blip from 1975 to 1976).  It fell
4% from 94 to 95 (this is the first decline in 20 years highlighted in the
10/96 radio address).   The decline has continued , though at a less
dramatic rate. Total reduction from 94 to 97 (preliminary) is 6%, which is
definitely worth mentioning in the VP's speech as an indication things are
heading in the right direction after 20 years of heading in the wrong di
rection.   The illegitimacy bonus rule will encourage states to do more to
build on these positive trends.   However, note that the bonus is actually
rewarded based on the percent not the rate because state level data is not
available for the rate (see below) .


3) the percent also peaked in 1994 at 32.6% after increasing every year
since 1975. It fell 1% from 94 to 95, then increased slightly to 32.4% in
96 and remains at this level for 97.

Trends by race: between 96 and 97, while the overall percent of births to
unmarried women remained constant, it decreased slightly for blacks,
increased slightly for Hispanics, and stayed constant for whites.

BONUS OUTLOOK
For FY 99, the bonus will be based on the change in the ratio of out of
wedlock births to total births for the 2 year period 94 - 95 compared to
96 - 97 (the statute requires the use of these two 2 year base periods) .
The 5 states with the largest decrease qualify for a bonus, but only if
they did not experience an increase in abortions since 95. Looking at the
preliminary data, it is not likely very many states will register a
decrease. The numbers tend to bounce around slightly from year to year,
and there are few states with clear, sustained downward trends.   Only 18
states had a decrease from 96 to 97, and most of these do not look like
they would show a decrease over the two 2 year periods required for the
borius. A few states who appear they might qualify (based on my rough
calculations) are D.C., IL, MI, MS, VA.  Interestingly, some of these have
actually had slight increases from 96 to 97, but the combined rate for the
most recent two year period still appears lower than the two-year base
period.
