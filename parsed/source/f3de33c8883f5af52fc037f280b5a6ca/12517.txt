Elena, Chris and Cynthia -

This a note in preparation for the public charge meeting on Thursday at
2pm. Please let me know if you have any comments, questions or need
further information.  Thanks.

                                 Irene



I.   PUBLIC CHARGE

         A. VP ANNOUNCEMENT IN TX- According to Sarah, the VP's office is
very interested in the VP announcing the public charge reg during his
upcoming trip in TX 5/24-5/26.    Sara may have an update for us at the 2pm
meeting.    Janet is fine with a VP announcement in TX.  I have not heard
from Maria but sent her an e-mail.

        B.   UPDATE ON CLEARANCE OF REG AND GUIDANCE - Agencies have
reviewed both documents and comments have been sent to DOJ/INS.   There are
a few minor issues to resolve. We are meeting this Friday, 5/10 with the
agencies to resolve the issues and I think we can get the issues
resolved.    According to OMB and my discussions with INS and agencies,
the issues are:
                1.    Refugees who adjust status to Legal Permanent
Residency - are they subject to public charge determination if they leave
the country for more than 180 days.
                2.    Clarify that immigrants who are "permanently"
residing in a long-term institution could be found to be a public charge.

        C: LISTENING MEETING ON THURSDAY, 5/6 -    We are holding a
listening meeting with the groups on Thursday.  They met previously with
INS on 5/4. My understanding is that the groups are pleased but have


similar concerns that were raised by us and the agencies.

        D. TIMELINE - I have drafted a timeline to meet a 5/24
announcement deadline (see attached) .


        E.  ROLL-OUT - Early next week, I plan to hold a roll-out meeting
with the ~gencies to discuss a roll-out schedule, to prepare materials
for briefings (fact sheets, qs and as), to compile a briefing list of
groups and Hill staff, and identify other amplification activites
(regional meetings, collaborating with groups, etc)

        F.  FEINSTEIN LETTER - I am working with INS and Feinstein's
staff to draft a letter that addresses Feinstein concerns but does not
give away everything and to discourage her from introducing her public
charge legislation.  I hope to have a draft by Thursday.

II.    NACARA - Related to our discussion on public charge roll-out, INS
will likely raise the timing issue of the NACARA Regs which is targeted
for 5/20 - when the donor nations gather in Stockholm to discuss·
assistance to Central America countries in the wake of Hurricane Mitch.
Their concern is that w~ may under criticism for doing too much for
immigrants - public charge, NACARA, and parity legislation.   I don't
agree and I think it is a good idea and we should not hold up any thing-
these regs have been long -awaited and the President made a commitment on
parity legislation.

Fyi - The NACARA reg was sent to OMB for review formally today and NSC,
DPC, OMB, State Dept. are reviewing the reg.   We expect to get DOJ
agreement to the State Dept. rationale for broad legislation on parity
during the IWG meeting on Thursday but John Morton has indicated that DOJ
may only agree to this broad legislation if they are not required to
provide administrative relief while the legislation is pending (ie
Deferred Enforced Departure [DED]).   I'm not sure if we can make this kind
of commitment and don't think we should tie our hands right now.     I will
work with Scott to schedule the deputy level meeting on the broad parity
legislation.
