TEXT:
These look good.  I think the Daschle proposal will be out by friday so do
you think we ought to include something on that.  The question would be
something designed to divided POTUS and Daschle:   "You've said you want
this procedure banned even pre-viability and since the Daschle approach
would not prohibit abortions using this procedure before viability, aren't
you saying in effect that you do not support the Daschle bill?"

                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

      Question: Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion
      Providers, said this week that he lied about partial birth abortions -- that they're performed more
      frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged and that they're often performed on
      healthy women with healthy fetuses. In light of his statements, are you going to change your
      position?

      Answer: No. My position remains what it has always been -- that so-called partial-birth
      abortions should be banned except when they are necessary to save the life of a woman or
      prevent serious harm to her health.

      Nothing Mr. Fitzsimmons has said conflicts with that position. I've never claimed that
      partial-birth abortions are used only to prevent death or serious harm. What I've said is that
      when the procedure is necessary for these reasons -- in those few cases when there are tragic
      circumstances involving serious harm the woman -- a doctor must be allowed to perform it. But
      when the procedure isn't necessary for these reasons, a doctor should not be allowed to perform
      it.

      So I will say again what I've said before: that I will sign a bill banning partial-birth abortions, but
      only if it has an exception that will protect those women -- even if few in number -- who need
      this procedure to save their lives or prevent serious harm to their health.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

     Question: Didn't you base your veto of the partial-birth abortion bill on false information -- i.e.,
     that this procedure is performed only on a few hundred women in desperate circumstances?

     Answer: No. I based my veto on the fact that there are a small group of women in desperate
     circumstances who need this procedure in order to save their lives or prevent serious injury to
     their health. I've never said that these are the only circumstances in which the procedure is
     used. Indeed, I've acknowledged that there are cases where the procedure is not necessary for
     life or serious health reasons -- and I've made very clear that I would sign legislation banning the
     procedure in those cases.




     Question: If Congress were to add a health exception to the partial birth bill you vetoed last year,
     that bill would prohibit all partial birth abortions -- including pre-viability partial birth abortions
     -- that aren't done for life or serious health reasons. Are you really saying that you would sign a
     bill of that kind -- a bill that prohibited a particular procedure (except if done for life or serious
     health reasons) in the pre-viability period?

     Answer: I have made very clear my condition for signing the partial birth bill. I told Congress
     that I would sign the bill if it protected women who needed the procedure to save their lives or
     avert serious harm to their health. I implored Congress to send me such a bill. I continue to
     take that position. If Congress adds a provision to the bill that protects women who need the
     procedure for life or serious health reasons, I will sign that bill.
