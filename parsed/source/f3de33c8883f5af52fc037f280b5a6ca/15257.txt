I plan to be with the first panel participants from about 9:10-9:50am in
Room 180 OEOB.  please feel free to page me if you need anything.

If anyone missed the First Lady's segment on the Today Show this morning,
it was a wonderful overview of the themes of the Conference (with Pat Kuhl
joining her to talk about language developement) .

Thanks and good luck everyone -- I think today will be spectacular.
