 TEXT:
 Just a reminder that we are meeting tomorrow (Wednesday 7/9) at 1:00 to
 nail down Title V.  Education has agreed to present options for better
 targeting the teacher preparation funds to urban and poor rural areas, and
 to provide estimates of the number of schools likely to participate in the
 teacher preparation program, the number of institutions likely to
 participate in the recruitment program and the number of students likely
 to benefit.

  See you then.
