FYI

We are going to be close enough to the 1 million goal that we can say that
we are on target.  (We'll add 44,000 this year, and will have to add
60,000 kids in each of the next two years to reach the goal).

I think the issue that is difficult is the out years and OMB says ,that they
won't be showing any out year numbers.
