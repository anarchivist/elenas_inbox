TEXT:
Elena,
thanks for your message.  Jim Dorskind wants you to clear my draft letter
to Patsy Fleming -- the bad part is that I need it back right away.  They
are having a good-bye party tomorrow at AIDS Policy and they want to
present the letter. Thanks.
Sarah x65514

As you leave the Administration, I want to thank you for your
hard work and many contributions to the Office of National AIDS
Policy.

During your tenure as Director, the White House Office of
National AIDS Policy made remarkable progress in our battle
against HIV and AIDS.  You oversaw significant increases in
funding for AIDS research, prevention, treatment, and housing
that helped to bring life-sustaining care to thousands more
Americans.  You helped focus a new national attention on the
critical challenges that HIV presents to young people.  The 1995
report on this topic has changed the national dialogue and
empowered young people to protect themselves. This period also
saw the development of the first-ever National AIDS Strategy,
which established goals for our nation and opportunities for
progress in the year ahead.

On behalf of all Americans, thank you for working so hard to end
the suffering caused by this terrible disease.  Hillary joins me
in sending best wishes for every future success and happiness.
