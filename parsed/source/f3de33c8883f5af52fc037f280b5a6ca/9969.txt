TEXT:
There was some confusion about whether the VP will be participating in the
W2W Partnership's event in D.C. on Nov. 18.   As of Ron Klain's scheduling
meeting this morning, the answer is No. There has also been a request
pending for the VP to do a meeting of his Welfare to Work Coalition to
Sustain Success, and that may happen on the 19th. Apparently these two
things got mixed up.
