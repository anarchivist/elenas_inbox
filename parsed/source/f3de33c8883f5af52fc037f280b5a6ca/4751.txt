                                        October 10, 1997


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




        1. Welfare: California Caseload Numbers - New data from California show that
caseloads are finally starting to decline there. While nationally caseloads have declined every
month since March of 1994, the welfare rolls were rising in California through early 1995 due
most likely to state's slow economic recovery. After falling 2 percent in 1995 and 7 percent in
1996, the rate of decline has nearly doubled this year, falling 7 percent in the first seven months
of the year. The LA Times gave this drop some prominent coverage on Thursday. Twenty two
percent of the nation's welfare recipients live in California.

        2. Welfare: Recipients Leaving the Rolls -- Two preliminary studies have been
released tracking welfare recipients leaving the welfare rolls in Maryland and Massachusetts.
Both studies found similar results.

        The Maryland study found that 54 percent of former recipients were working within three
months of leaving the rolls and four-fifths were still off the rolls after six months. The study's
author, Professor Catherine Born of the University of Maryland, did not account for the
remaining recipients, but plans to do so in a follow-up report to be released next year. The
study found, not surprisingly, that welfare recipients with recent work experience were more
likely to be working once they left the rolls (66 percent vs. 54 percent), and those with younger
children were more likely to return to the rolls. Notably, the study found no increase in foster
care caseloads as a result of welfare reform. This research project will track this sample of
recipients for two years.

        The Massachusetts study found that 50 percent of former recipients were working after
exiting the rolls. Of the remaining, nearly a third had other means of support or had left the
state, 9 percent had children who had grown too old to qualify, and 6 percent were in the process
of reapplying for welfare. The average wage of former recipients was $6.72 per hour. As
found in Maryland, the majority of those who went to work were employed in clerical, sales,
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
health care, and service industries. The state Department of Transitional Assistance plans to
release a follow-up study by late next year.

       3. Welfare: Exempting Workfare from FICA Taxes -- We have indicated our support
for Rep. Shaw's new legislative proposal to exempt workfare participants from FICA and
unemployment taxes. This proposal is a significant improvement over earlier proposals that
would have endangered labor protections and weakened the work requirements. Our only
concern is that this exemption should be limited to traditional workfare, so that states are not
permitted to reclassify subsidized private sector jobs as workfare in order to avoid FICA taxes.
But we believe we can accomplish this through regulation. On Thursday, Rep. Shaw tried to
add his amendment to a tax technicals bill in Ways and Means, but since it was non-germane to
the underlying bill, he withdrew it before a vote could be taken.

        4. Welfare: Senator Murray's Proposal - As you may know, Senator Murray has
long advocated a proposal which would exclude individuals with a history of domestic violence
from the welfare work requirements and time limits. Currently, states can exempt such
individuals, so long as they put 30 percent of their overallcase1oad to work and enforce the
federal five year time limit for 80 percent of the caseload. Under Senator Murray's approach, if
10 percent of the caseload were granted domestic violence waivers then only 20 percent of the
total caseload would have to work. Our concern is two-fold: I} this proposal would allow
welfare programs to ignore particularly needy individuals who need intensive assistance to
become self-sufficient; and 2} this proposal would allow states to "game" the work rates and time
limits by handing out waivers to people who don't need them.

       We instead have been planning, through regulations, to provide states with reasonable
cause exceptions to penalties if they fail to meet the work rates or time limit rules because they
granted domestic violence waivers, so long as these waivers were temporary and included
services to help individuals become self-sufficient. We believe this approach has several
advantages: I} it only provides exceptions from penalties if a state provides services to these
individuals; and 2} it significantly limits the "gaming" possibilities by providing some review
by HHS during the reasonable cause process.

       Senator Murray's proposal has passed the Senate several times -- most recently as part of
the Labor-HHS appropriations bill -- it has always been dropped in conference (a pattern started
by former MajOrity Leader Dole when he accepted this and many other amendments to help.
move the welfare legislation off the Senate floor, and then dropped most of them in conference.)
Now that the Labor-HHS bill is in conference, Senator Murray has been lobbying us to support
her proposal and has spoken to both Erskine and Frank Raines. We have shared with Senator
Murray information to help her revise her proposal along the lines described above, while
making clear that the details of the Administration's proposal are still being finalized. She
seems to prefer the absolute, upfront exemption from work rates and time limits created by her
proposal.

                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


        5. Welfare: Social Security Administration's 30-day Review of Children's SSI
Process -In a meeting with you last month, disability advocates expressed concern about SSA's
process for redetermining the eligibility of 288,000 children for SSI benefits under the new
childhood disability standard. At that meeting, you stated that you had asked SSA to send you
a report on its process in 30 days. While that meeting was going on, Ken Apfel was testifying at
his confirmation that he would begin a "top-to-bottom" 30-day review of the process as soon as
he was confirmed. He was confirmed a few weeks later. SSA has requested that, instead of
having two overlapping 30-day reviews, we have a single 30-day one beginning from the date of
Apfel's confirmation. Advocates appear to be comfortable with this revised timetable.

       6. Adoption: Senate Legislation - A bipartisan group of Senators led by Senators
Rockefeller and Chafee and including Craig, Jeffords, Dewine, Bond, Coats, Levin and Landrieu
-- have announced agreement on child welfare legislation called the Promotion of Adoption,
Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act (PASS). As you know, the House
passed a child welfare bill similar to your Adoption 2002 proposal last spring, but Senate action
had been stalled. Mrs. Clinton spoke with Senator Rockefeller just before the agreement was
reached to urge Congressional action and assure the Senator that the Administration would
review the bill quickly.

         PASS incorporates many provisions of Adoption 2002. It also includes other measures
that we support, including judicial reforms and reauthorization of the Family Preservation and
Support Act. However, the Senate bill requires the federal government to pay adoption
assistance for all children in foster care, regardless of income. This provision costs $2.4 billion
and is paid for with an offset that the Administration had hoped to use for other priorities (such
as child care). Because we do not believe that this provision would increase the number of
adoptions, we are working with HHS and OMB to develop an alternative offset and a less
expensive proposal that would guarantee Medicaid coverage to children with special needs. We
and plan to discuss these options with Senators Rockefeller and Chafee as soon as possible. Our
goal is to have an adoption bill on your desk before Congress leaves for recess.

         7. Education: Charter Schools Bill Approved by House Education Committee on
24-8 Bipartisan Vote - On Thursday ten Democrats and fourteen Republicans voted to approve
amendments to the ESEA Public Charter Schools Program. The bill would give priority for new
grants to states which give charter schools a high degree of autonomy over expenditures, allow
the number of charter schools to increase, and periodically review each school to ensure
academic performance requirements are met. The bill also incorporates the President's goal of
increasing the number of charter schools to 3,000 by the year 2000. Prior to committee action
the bill was substantially improved in response to concerns raised by the Department of
Education, and Rep. Roemer joined Rep. Riggs as a co-sponsor. One outstanding issue is that
the bill would allow sub-grants to existing charter schools to be lengthened by two years,
potentially reducing start-up funds available to new schools and risking long-term dependence on
federal funding. Administration staff will continue to work with the sponsors to strengthen the
legislation.

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

        8. Education: National Tests - As the LaborlHHS conference proceeds, Obey, Porter
and a number of others have begun to float possible compromises on the national tests. Each of
the proposals presumes that we receive the funds and authority to develop the tests under NAB's
control. They differ primarily with respect to the circumstances under which test implementation
would be permitted to proceed. Specific proposals include (1) requiring specific Congressional
authorization before implementation; (2) requiring a majority of states to sign up before
implementation could begin; and, (3) making test implementation an allowable state and local
use of Chapter II funds, but providing no specific funding for initial implementation. An option
reflecting a different approach would require that we undertake the R&D to statistically link tests
already used by states and local school districts to the NAEP performance standards so that states
could continue to administer the same tests and provide students with a statistically-derived score
on the national test as well. Most of these altematives have some clear advantages as well as
clear down sides, with none emerging as a clear favorite for us. We are working to identify
modifications that could strengthen each of them, and to identify additional possibilities as well.
As of yet, none of these has gained any significant backing among conferees, or support from
Goodling.

      Goodling and Ashcroft publicly are hardening their opposition to the tests. Ashcroft has
announced that he now has 35 Senators lined up in opposition to the tests (though he has not
produced a list of them), up from the 27 he named a week ago. Both Goodling and Ashcroft
have sent Secretary Riley a series of letters continuing to criticize steps the Education
Department had taken prior to its temporary halt on test development.

      In addition, Goodling announced at Thursday's scheduled mark-up on America Reads that
he was postponing action on the bill until we reversed our position on national testing. In
reality, Goodling is under strong pressure from the right wing on his committee not to advance a
reading bill that reflects our priorities. Consequently, Goodling is now in the position of
blocking two key steps to improve early reading--higher standards and tests and a reading
program that helps families, schools and volunteers help kids learn to read.

        On Wednesday, John Doerr, Jim Barkesdale and 4 additional high-tech CEO's met with
Gingrich, Lott, Goodling, and a number of other Republicans in both houses to urge them to
support the tests. Feedback from their meetings as well meetings Leg. Affairs has had suggest
that both Lott and Goodling are urging that a compromise be found.

       9. Education: D.C. Vouchers - The House passed a voucher amendment to the DC
appropriations bill by a one vote margin (203-202).

       10. Health Care: Surgeon General Confirmation - The Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee held its confirmation hearing for Dr. David Satcher this Wednesday. The
hearing went extremely well, and Senators on both sides of the aisle praised Dr. Satcher. Few
controversial issues were raised. He was not questioned on many of the high profile iss~es we


                                                4
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
were expecting, including needle exchange and AIDS research in Africa. It appears likely that
the final full Senate vote on Dr. Satcher's confirmation will take place as early as the week of
October 20th.

         11. Health Care: New York Provider Tax - On Thursday HHS met with Governor
Pataki and members of the New York delegation as it released its announcement of how the
Administration will work towards ensuring that all states' provider taxes are in compliance with
the law. Clearly Governor Pataki chose to portray our response as being completely
unsatisfactory. This is the case despite the fact that our position on provider taxes is the most
favorable position we could have taken for New York (and all other states with potentially
impermissible provider taxes) within the constraints of the law. If this wasn't the case, we
would not be having to ask for legislation to give the Secretary authority she does not now have
to waive up to all past liability for currently impermissible taxes. It is further validated by those
staff members of the House Committee of Jurisdiction (who hate provider taxes) who are
criticizing us for being too favorable to New York and resentful that we are pushing a legislative
strategy. All things considered, however, we believe that our positioning on this issue is as well
as could be hoped for and most realistically positions us to eventually and most expeditiously
ensure that all states come into compliance.

       12. Health Care: FDA Reform - FDA reform passed the House this week and is now
moving into conference. We are hopeful that the outstanding issues will be resolved in
conference and that you will be sent a bill that we would recommend signing.

        13. Health Care: Kassebaum-Kennedy Implementation - As you know, there was a
story in The New York Times last Sunday that reported that some insurers are giving agents
incentives to not enroll high-risk populations. Such actions are completely inconsistent with the
spirit of the Kassebaum-Kennedy law. We are meeting with HCFA, the agency responsible for
administering this provision of the new law, to review all of the Federal and State statutory
authority to stop such practices. We will keep you apprised as we move forward.

         14. Health Care: Conf"lrmation of Nancy-Ann Min DeParle as HCFA Administrator
     Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, your new appointment for HCFA Administrator, has had two
Senate holds placed on her confirmation. Senator Harkin (D-IA) has placed a hold because of
his frustration with the Administration's lack of enforcement of his fraud and abuse priority
initiatives. Senator Kyl (R-AZ) has just placed a hold apparently because of his concern about
the Administration's opposition to his amendment to reopen up the balanced budget act to allow
physicians negotiate private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries.

       On Wednesday Nancy-Ann met with Senator Harkin's staff and made a commitment to
address many of the Senator's priorities. The Senator and his staff seemed quite pleased and it
appears likely that Harkin will soon release his hold. Since Senator Kyl's hold was placed on
Thursday of this week, we have not had the opportunity to arrange an acceptable arrangement to
remove his hold. We are still conducting a thorough policy review on the Kyl Amendment, but


                                                 5
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
are concerned that it could lead to more fraud and abuse in Medicare and dramatically increase
beneficiary out-of-pocket costs.

        We believe that the fact that Nancy-Ann has not been confinned undennines her ability to.
be as effective as possible in administering one of the most complex and complicated agencies in
the Federal government. We have and will continue to make her continnation one of our
highest priorities this fall.
