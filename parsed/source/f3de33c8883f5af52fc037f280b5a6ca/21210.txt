TEXT:
Labor has double checked. USDA was correct. Under MSPA, the employer is
obliged to provide the weeks of employment specified in the offer of
employment (at the specified wage), unless there is an "act of God." MSPA
also provides a private right of action to enforce the employment
contract.

The one hindrance to enforcement   is that MSPA, unlike the H2A program,
does not require that the period   of employment offered be precise (thus,
could offer "at least 6 weeks of   work, but possibly 8"). However, there
is a possibility to challenge an   employment contract in some cases. as
false and misleading.

Subject: Update for this afternoon's meeting

Elena/Sally:
Contrary to what we were told by the USDA, John Fraser at the DOL says
that he is not sure that the MSPA requires the payment of 100% of the
contract wage.  Labor was at the meeting when USDA asserted this (and we
all discussed it), but they now question whether this is a statutory
requirement. John is checking on this.

What is clearly true is that a U.S. worker who has a work contract that is
broken (b/c promised 8 wks of work, but provided with only 5 wks) could


bring an action against the employer for breach.   This option is less
possible for migrant workers.
