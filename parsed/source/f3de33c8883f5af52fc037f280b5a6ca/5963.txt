TEXT:
In response to inquiries about crop insurance from Senator Conrad, we met
with the folks from Agriculture.  There are two promising ideas on the
crop insurance front, both of which USDA is working on.  One idea is whole
farm insurance, which would insure about 50% of revenues from entire farm
operations. These revenues would be determined by Schedule F tax
filings.  The other idea is a farm IRA, which would not be tax deferred,
and would allow farmers to put up to 20% of their receipts in an account.
Money could only be withdrawn from these accounts if farm income falls
below a certain level.

We are going to follow up on these ideas in the farm working group
meetings that Torn is having. We are going to have the first meeting this
week with Greg Frazier (COS to Glickman), Dave Carlin (legis affairs),
Carl Whillock, and Barbara Wooley. Thanks, Mary
