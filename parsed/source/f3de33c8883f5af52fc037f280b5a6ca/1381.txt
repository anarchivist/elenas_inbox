I would advise against a meeting for that purpose. We need to bring them
along, but we shouldn't really care what OMB and NEC think.  Ken, Gene and
I already basically agreed to endorse the Stenholm bill, with some
caveats. Our mtgs with these guys should be along the lines of "here's
what we're going to do, OK?"
