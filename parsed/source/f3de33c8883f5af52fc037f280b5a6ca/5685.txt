TEXT:
As you know, we get monthly numbers of each federal agency's welfare hires
from the Office of Personnel Management -- the latest numbers (from Oct.
22nd) show 2,098 hires.  In addition, the agencies submitted narrative
reports for FY '97 to the Vice President.  Andrea and I met with the NPR
staff, and we'd like to propose to:

        1) Prepare one page summaries of each agency's accomplishments, to
release at the one year anniversary of the Presidential executive order
(March 8th). Or would you prefer to have them for the State of the
Union?

        2) Hold a DPC meeting in January, possibly attended by the VP, so
that selected agencies can share what's worked for them.

What do you think?
