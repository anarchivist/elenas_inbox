    SUBJECT:      21 st Century Trust Fund

           There is growing bipartisan support for a substantial new investment in biomedical
    research. This support is driven by the great potentials for biological breakthroughs in
    biomedical research and by increasing concerns that the rising costs of caring for the baby
    boomers will overwhelm the Medicare Trust Fund. New investments in research which could
    prevent or delay the onset of costly chronic diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and
    osteoporosis and improve treatment methods have the potential to deliver enormous social and
    economic benefits. We are developing proposals to substantially increase the NIH budget
    through the creation of a new 21 st century biomedical research trust fund. We are considering
    options ranging from $10 billion to $15 billion. However, to double the NIH budget over the ten
    years would cost about $15 billion. We are recommending that this substantial investment be
    funded primarily, if not solely, from new resources from tobacco.

    Background

            Recent progress in biomedical research has ensured that many of the diseases Americans
    faced a generation ago can now be prevented or treated. Smallpox has been eradicated from the
    entire world and polio is gone from the Western Hemisphere. Surgical interventions, such as
    organ transplantation or cardiac pacemakers, can restore normal lives for those who once had few
    treatment options. Because of a combination of new therapies, AIDS patients can plan for a
    future they would have otherwise been denied a few years ago. These successes, and many
    others, would not have occurred without our Nation's strong sustained support of biomedical
    research.

            We are now posed to make even more advances that, with sufficient investment, could
    dramatically alter and improve the way we treat diseases. There are several new technologies in
    medical research that show great promise: important strides in imaging technologies make it
    possible to visualize living cells and entire organs giving new insights into the structure of
    disease; computer-based intervention systems give scientists an entire range of new tools to
    rapidly analyze vast amounts of new data; and we are on the cusp of a host of breakthroughs in
    genetics which will enable scientists to map the entire human genome and revolutionize how we
    understand, treat, and prevent some of our most devastating diseases.
able to pinpoint more effective treatments for prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer and identify
individuals at increased risk for diseases like, heart disease and stroke, Alzheimer, and severe
depression. A more precise understanding of an individual's genetic risks will enable
researchers to develop more targeted and effective medications. Also, new promising laboratory
and clinical research will improve medical treatments. For example, methods for accurately
measuring blood glucose levels and improving metabolic control will enable doctors to prevent
the debilitating and devastating nerve, kidney, and eye complications of diabetes. Finally, there
is great potential for effective vaccines for global threats, such as AIDS, malaria, and
tuberculoses, and new knowledge about the biological basis of craving and addiction will result
in medications targeted specifically to receptors in the brain that playa role in substance abuse.

        The concept of significant increases in NIH has great support in the Congress. In the last
couple years, NIH has received nearly a $1 billion a year increase. In fact, in recent years,
Congress has appropriated more funding in NIH than we have proposed. Earlier this year,
64 Senators signed a letter stating their support for doubling the NIH budget over the next five
years ($40-$50 billion), and Senator Kennedy explicitly called for this investment in his recently
introduced tobacco bill. However, CBO is unlikely to raise revenue anywhere near the level that
Senator Kennedy's legislation assumes. As a result, he and other Members of Congress
interested in such investments, will likely have to scale back their proposals.

Financing a Historic Increase in the Biomedical Research Budget

        Doubling the NIH budget over the next ten years would cost approximately $15 billion. A
$10 billion increase over the next five years would also represent a significant investment, even
assuming the recent large increases in the NIH budget. Your advisors do not believe that either
of these options could be feasible within the context of the current discretionary caps. In fact,
any large investment in biomedical research, if funded within these tight budget caps, would
drown out other priorities. Instead, we believe that this initiative should be paid for in the
context of any agreement we reach on tobacco. Any revenue raised from such an agreement
would be dedicated to a 21 st century research trust fund which would supplement the base
spending in the discretionary budget for NIH. This proposal assumes that the discretionary
budget would have either no increase or a current service level (inflation adjustment).

        Your advisors believe that even funding biomedical research at $10 billion over the next
five years would be significant and would be one of the most substantial items in your budget. It
is not altogether clear that funding more than $10 billion would be a better use of funds than
other priority investments. Having said this, there is a large and growing constituency for
doubling the budget and expectations from the research and patient advocacy community are
high. As a consequence, anything below the $15 billion -- while major by any measure -- may
not be validated by all as a visionary development on the future. Moreover, the investment may
well be outdone by Republicans and Democrats on the Hill.


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
    ,



             Another possibility that has been raised is to place special emphasis on the National
    Cancer Institute (NCI) Budget. Some have proposed doubling the NCI budget ($1.5 billion and
    $4 billion over five years). This would make a significant contribution to cancer treatment, which
    will become the leading killer of Americans in the next century, and there are certainly
    well-documented links between tobacco and cancer. However, we believe that this would have
    to be done in the context oflarge increases in the NIH budget. Linking tobacco only to cancer
    research belies the fact that smoking is associated with a number of other diseases, such as heart
    disease and diabetes. As a stand alone policy, it would be at risk of being overshadowed by a
    more broad-based commitment that will likely come from the Hill. However, we could place a
    special emphasis on cancer and double the NCI budget on top of a $10 billion overall increase in
    NIH.

    Discussion

             All of your advisors support a large increase in biomedical research. HHS explicitly
    wants to double the budget whereas most of your other advisors believe that calling for 21st
    century trust fund and increasing research by at least $10 billion is strongly defensible. A
    substantial investment in NIH will also no doubt receive strong support from public health
    groups, such as the National Breast Cancer Coalition,the American Heart Association and the
    American Diabetes Association. Opponents note that other areas of research at NASA and the
    National Science Foundation which look at areas such as information communications and the
    environment should not be overlooked. They also argue that in the context of an extremely
    limited budget vast increase in biomedical research are excessive. They assume that
    Republicans will still find ways to outspend us in this area. Understanding their concerns, the
    DPCINEC believe that if you take the lead in substantially increasing the NIH budget and are the
    first to propose a credible means to pay for it, that your commitment will be appropriately
    recognized.
