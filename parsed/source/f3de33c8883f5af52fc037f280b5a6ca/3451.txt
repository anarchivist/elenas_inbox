We received this request from Ann.   She told me just now that she needs a
brief blurb on this by tomorrow morning.   Is it possible for someone in
your shop to draft something, since you all are taking the lead on crime
policy issues.  I'll be happy to review anything you all put together, and
I can let you know what I know about GP's case as well if you haven't
heard of it. Thanks!

Geronimo Pratt is speaking at NABJ on Thursday prior to the POTUS speech.
Can you help pull together a statement or response to "Do you feel the
plight of G>P is indicative of the relationship between African AMeicans
and the u.S Justice Department? "

We also need a brief statement on Pratt -- I'm sure this will be a topic
of interest. THanks.
