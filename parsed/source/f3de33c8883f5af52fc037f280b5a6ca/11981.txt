TEXT:
A preliminary planning meeting about the Philadelphia PBOR event took
place this week with WH communications and some House staff.
Communications has requested that we start working with the Hill on press
paper for the event. The Hill has taken a first stab at draft paper.   I
have given this draft to Chris' office to make comments. Bruce/Elena
do you want to see this first draft before comments are made?

As of now, plans for the days' PBOR events are as follow:
D.C. event with members, and possibly VP, to unveil the on-line petition.
[You should have received a draft of this petition.   Please let me know
asap if you have any comments/edits for this petition.]
Other members will take a bus from DC to Philadelphia to participate in a
large, rally-type event with the President. Location has yet to be
determined.

Let me know if you have any questions.     Thanks.
