TEXT:
Jeff Goldberg is working on ·a cover story on the tobacco companies for the
magazine that might run on June 14 or June 21.   He's looking to complete
work on it by the beginning of June. The piece is on how the industry
faces the legislative process and the entire political process -- public
hostility, etc.  He'll have interviews with most or all of the CEO's.

He wants to interview folks around here, and I gave him a few names, but
what he wants most is to talk to the VP.

Seems like a good piece for him to be in.    Reactions?

Let me know.
