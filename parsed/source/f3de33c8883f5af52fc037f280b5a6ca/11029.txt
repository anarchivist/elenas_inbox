Subject:         Re: school construction

I already spoke with USA Today.      (Bill Welch)

In general, we should say "the President fought very hard for school
construction last year, but Republicans in Congress resisted him every
step of the way.  We have an ambitious proposal to modernize America's
schools in this year's budget, and we hope Republicans are more willing to
consider it this year."

On background, Archer's proposal, while expensive, would not do nearly as
much to spur modernization and construction as the President's.

ARBITRAGE DOES NOTHING FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION

Background: House Republicans have proposed extending the period that
local governments could retain arbitrage profits on tax-exempt school
construction
bonds from 2 to 4 years.  Some school associations (e.g. school
administrators)
are supporting the proposal as a step in the right direction.   It is good
that Republicans
are starting to see the importance of the Federal government helping to
address record school enrollment and critical backlogs of renovation
needs. However:

DO      The arbitrage proposal promises nothing for school construction,
and may
        even delay construction. While it allows local governments to
keep more profits
        from investing their bond proceeds, that simply means that the
money is not


        being used on much-needed construction and renovation projects.

DO      The extra profits would not need to be used for school
construction.

DO      Schools that need the most help may get nothing at all.   Only
schools that have
        bond fund sitting in investments would benefit.

DO      Urban schools agree: Arbitrage is not enough.   The NationD,s
largest school
        districts found that D&these limited arbitrage benefits do not
compare favorably
        to the AdministrationD,s school modernization proposal. (Council
of Great City
        Schools, September 22, 1998).
