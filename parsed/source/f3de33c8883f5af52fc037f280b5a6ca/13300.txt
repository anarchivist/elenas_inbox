HI!
I'm trying all the electronic modes to find you! Tried beeper and
voice mail yesterday, so figured I'd try email today.
I understand there is a draft letter on HR1833 floating around. I
would very much like to see a copy. My understanding from Kathy
is that it is a response to Hatch? George and Pat had indicated
they did not want to respond to the Dole letter. This isn't that,
is it?
Call me when you get a moment, 65584. thanks.
