Dear Chairman Kennard and Commissioners:

        Last night in the State of the Union Address I called upon the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) to act to require media outlets to provide candidates with free and discounted
airtime for campaign advertising. Free and discounted time will reduce the need for more
campaign money, and will allow candidates to spend less time fundraising and more time
addressing the concems of our country.

        Spending in congressional campaigns has risen sixfold in the last two decades, more than
three times the rate of inflation, and spending on television is the primary reason. In 1972,
candidates spent $25 million for political ads; in 1996, they spent $400 million. The evidence at
the beginning of this election year is that the cost of media spending by candidates for public office
will continue to spiral upwards. The time has come to free our democracy from the grip of big
money.

       The dawning of the digital age of broadcasting makes now the right time to update
broadcasters' public interest obligation. Broadcasters have been loaned an additional channel
worth tens of billions of dollars for free. The FCC must ensure that broadcasters, given the
opportunity to benefit from their use of a valuable public resource, use this public resource to
strengthen our democracy.

        The Advisory Committee on the Public Interest Responsibilities of Digital Broadcasters
has already begun to examine how broadcasters' public interest obligations can be revitalized in
the digital age. I hope that the Advisory Committee's findings will help the FCC decide how
broadcasters can use the public'S airways to improve our democracy.

       Free and discounted television time can make our most powerfully effective medium a
powerful force for expanding democracy in the infonnation age. I call upon the Commission to
develop policies which ensure that broadcasters provide free and discounted airtime for candidates
to educate voters.

                                              Sincerely,

                                                               Automated Records Management SystelT'
