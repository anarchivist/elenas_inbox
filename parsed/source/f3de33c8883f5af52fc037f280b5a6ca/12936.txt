Today, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act (EPICC) will be
introduced in both the House and the Senate. I urge Congress to pass legislation, which will
ensure that women across our nation have access to the full range of contraceptive care. Family
planning is basic health care for women although too many health plans do not cover the full cost
of this care.

In October oflast year, Congress took a historic step forward in making health care costs for
women more equitable when it approved legislation as part of the FY 1999 Omnibus
Appropriations Act requiring all insurance plans participating in the Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program that cover prescription drugs, to include contraceptive drugs and devices as
part of that coverage. I strongly urge Congress to pass legislation that is similar to that enacted
last year, so those women outside of the federal workforce may share these important benefits.

Even though well over 80 percent of private insurance plans cover prescription drugs in general,
only about one-third cover the costs of oral contraceptives (the most commonly used birth
control method). Yet, research shows that three out of every four women say that cost is an
important factor when choosing between a birth control method that is covered and one that is
not. Moreover, women of childbearing age spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health care
costs than do men.

In addition, we know that improved contraceptive coverage means fewer unintended
pregnancies, which means fewer abortions. This is a goal we all share.

 I urge Congress to pass contraceptive coverage legislation that will put women health care
consumers on a more level playing field, reduce unwanted pregnancies, and improve the quality
of care for women across the nation.
