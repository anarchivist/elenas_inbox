FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      FEBRUARY 5, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The House Appropriations Committee met today to approve Committee Rules
for the 105th Congress. During his opening remarks, Chairman Livingtston
urged the Congress to approve a balanced budget deal this year, so
mandatory programs can be controlled. He indicated that he expects total
discretionary spending to be trimmed.  He expects the CommitteeD,s focus
this year to be on oversight, fine-tuning programs, and trimming programs,
rather than on significant terminations.  He also indicated that all
supplementals would have to be paid for.  The Committee approved a new
rule reducing from three to two the number of days available for minority
members to file their views.

Also today, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee reported
out H.R. 4, the D&Truth in Budgeting Act,DS without amendment and by a
unanimous voice vote. The bill would exempt spending from four
transportation trust funds (Airport and Airways, Highway, Inland,
Waterways, and Harbor Maintenance) from controls imposed by the Balanced
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, including discretionary
caps and pay-as-you-go procedures. While the Chairmahd and Ranking Member
expressed a desire to move the bill to the House Floor as quickly as
possible, no specific schedule was discussed at the meeting.
