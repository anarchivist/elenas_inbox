MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

SUBJECT:       Enforcing the Youth Handgun Safety Act


Each year, firearms claim the lives of too many of our young people. Overall, they are
responsible for 12 percent of fatalities among American children and teenagers, as well as for 1
out of every 4 deaths of kids aged 15 to 19. Firearms have led to a near tripling in the number of
juvenile homicides since 1984, and they are the primary method by which young people commit
suicide.

To address this issue, my Administration has consistently called for toughening our laws to help
reduce youth gun violence. Specifically, my Administration has fought for and gained passage
of: (1) the Brady Act, to allow local law enforcement to conduct background checks before
handguns are sold; (2) the Assault Weapons Ban, to keep deadly assault weapons off the streets;
(3) the Gun-Free Schools Act, to establish a policy of "zero tolerance" for guns in our schools;
and (4) the Youth Handgun Safety Act, to prohibit, under most circumstances, the transfer to or
possession of a handgun by a juvenile.

More recently, my Administration proposed comprehensive juvenile crime legislation that,
among other things, would continue to crack down on youth gun violence by increasing penalties
for transferring a firearm to juveniles, prohibiting violent juveniles from owning firearms as
adults and requiring federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to provide a child safety lock with every
gun sold. I hope Congress will enact these important measures as soon as possible.

Until Congress acts, however, there is more my Administration can do to keep guns out of the
hands of our nation's youth. Existing law already bans the juvenile possession of handguns,
except in specified circumstances, and grants you the authority to prescribe such rules and
regulations to implement this provision. Thus, I hereby direct you to take the steps necessary to
ensure that FFLs are doing everything possible to enforce the provisions of the Youth Handgun
Safety Act, including, but not limited to, the use of signs, labels and other forms of written
notification to indicate that:

        (1) handguns are dangerous and a leading cause of juvenile fatalities;

       (2) federal law prohibits, in most circumstances, for anyone under the age of 18 to
       knowingly possess a handgun, or for an adult to transfer a handgun to such a minor;

       (3) violators of this prohibition will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law; and

       (4) safely storing and locking handguns can help ensure compliance with federal law.



                                                  Automated Records Management System

including state liability laws.

Your response to this directive will help inform gun purchasers about their responsibility under
federal law to keep handguns from our children. It will also ensure that gun purchasers are
warned about the dangers of handguns to our kids -- not unlike the warnings that are currently
included with the sale of household items, such as kitchen cleansers. You should proceed as
quickly as possible to carry out this directive.
