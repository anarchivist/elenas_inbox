           Families of school shooting
           victims begin anti-gun
           campaign

           DENVER (May 1, 1999 8:06 p.m. EDT
           http://www.nandotimes.com) - Amid the tolling of bells,
           families of shooting victims launched a campaign
           Saturday, saying they hoped the Columbine High
           School killings would help spur parents to seek a ban
           on assault weapons.

           The group, called the Bell Campaign, is aiming to
           generate support for more restrictive gun policies in
           the same way that MADD (Mothers Against Drunk
           Drivers) has successfully raised awareness about the
           dangers of drinking while driving.

           Members of the Bell Campaign held a vigil here for
           the victims of the Columbine shooting and rang a bell
           15 times. The two teenage gunmen killed 13 people
           in the school in the Denver suburb of Littleton and
           then apparently themselves.



  The Bell Campaign is calling for a ban on assault
  weapons and the mandatory licensing of all gun
  owners and registering of all guns.

  The vigil came as thousands of anti-gun
  demonstrators marched in Denver to protest the
  annual meeting being held here by the nation's
  largest gun owners group, the National Rifle
  Association. At the meeting a defiant NRA President
  Charlton Heston told cheering supporters that
  anti-gun advocates were wrongly blaming gun
  owners for others' crimes.

  Among the Bell Campaign's founding members are
  Charles and MaryLee Blek, whose oldest son was
  shot to death five years ago while visiting New York
  City.

  Although the weapon was never located, the Bleks
  say results of ballistics tests showed it was the sort of
  cheap handgun that has turned up repeatedly in
  shooting deaths around the country.

  "Enough is enough," said MaryLee Blek. "When you
  sanction that (kind of weapon), all you're doing is
  sanctioning the hunting of other human beings."

  Although most of the members of The Bell Campaign
  have lost family members to guns, the group says it
  believed it has the support of a broader population.

  "We think the majority of Americans think the way we
  do," said Kae MCGuire, another founder. "The victims
  who are leading this effort believe they can reach
  America and America will respond."

  The Bell Campaign members were joined Saturday
  by one concerned parent, Britt Bourque, who said
  she drove from New Mexico in her 20-year old
  recreational vehicle just to protest the meeting of the
  National Rifle Association.

  In an open letter to Heston, Bourqe alluded to the
  former actor"s most famous role as Moses in "The
  Ten Commandments" to urge him to take on a new
  leadership role.

  "Moses, there is a plague in our land and we are
  dying," Bourque said in her letter. "The plague is
  guns .... Moses, we need you to help lead us out of
  this perilous land."
