TEXT:
Had an idea--I was listening to Mandy Patimkin, who is in town and just
had corneal transplants. He has become a major spokesperson for organ
transplants, and listening to the terrible statistics on need and
availability, it seems to me that this is a good project for the President
to push. We could do a really wonderful event, with recipients and with
Mandy, and announce some kind of new initiative where people who interface
somehow with the federal govt.,i.e., Social Security, could sign up to be
a donor.  Mail cards with the checks for two months--something.   Let me
know.
