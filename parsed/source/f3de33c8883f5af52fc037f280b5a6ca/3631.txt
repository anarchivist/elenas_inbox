TEXT:
This was in potus' speech on education today ..

It suggests the tone he wants to strike on Monday
Are we doing enough on education? I don't want to
get in one of these situations where we think the speech
 is on one thing, and he thinks it's on anohter ....

            " And let me say, the Secretary of Education and I are
about to leave to go out to Las Vegas to meet with the governors.
Now, if this event had gone on in 1979 or 1980 or 1983 or 1984, the
governors would have been the first group out there. And they've
been dragging their feet, and don't you believe for a moment that
Dick Riley and I aren't going to tell them wh~t we saw at the
Elementary School Principals convention.  (Applause.)
