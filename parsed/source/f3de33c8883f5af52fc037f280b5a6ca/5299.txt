TEXT:
We've been thrown into a couple of Millennium meetings and the ideas they
are throwing around are what you'd expect-- cultural exchanges, gifts to
the future, etc. We are compiling a list which we'll forward-- there are
a few interesting things.

As an alternative, however, what is the feasibility/desirability of using
this for a different type of agenda? For instance, what about a
bipartisan summit on drastically reducing drug use in the next century?
Other DPC issues might make a decent 21st issue project-- a conference on
the direction of medical research for the next century? Education or
welfare might also be opportunities ...

Regards, Tom
