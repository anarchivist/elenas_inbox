     TEXT:
          Tom and I met with Richard Socarides just to ensure that we had
     covered all bases.  In addition, we talked to Mac Reed in OMB who heads up
     the interagency vetting process. Mac indicated that the process usually
     gets started with a memo to Frank Raines.   We have drafted a copy of the
     memo to OMB with the draft of the actual executive order.   In addition,
     DOJ OLC already has preliminarily reviewed the draft executive order and
     concluded that it looks fine to them.     If you don't have any changes to
     the attached document, we can send it over to Mac and OMB for you.   Let us
     know if there is anything else Mary     ==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ========

MEMORANDUM FOR FRANKLIN D. RAINES

THROUGH:              MAC REED

FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                      ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:            EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROHIBIT DISCRIMINATION BASED ON
               SEXUAL ORIENTATION


        We request that you process this executive order pursuant to Executive Order No. 11030,
as amended. For the reasons described below, we request that you complete this process QY.
Friday, August 15, 1997.

       . The Administration would like to enact an executive order to prohibit discrimination
based on sexual orientation in federal civilian employment. Although most agencies currently
have some sort of policy prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, this
executive order is needed to provide a uniform policy to replace the patchwork of policies in the
agencies. In addition, this executive order should be enacted in August before the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act of 1997, which the Administration supports, is scheduled for a hearing
this fall. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would prohibit discrimination based on
sexual orientation, in both the public and private sectors, with certain exemptions for small
businesses, charitable organizations, and the military.

        Attached is a draft of the executive order which would amend Executive Order No. 11478
entitled "Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government."
DRAFf                                                                          Hex-Dump ConversIon

EXECUTIVE ORDER #

                   Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government

By the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and statutes of
the United States, it is ordered as follows:

SEC 1. Executive Order No. 11478, as amended, is further amended by substituting "age, or
sexual orientation" for "or age" in the first sentence of Sec 1.
