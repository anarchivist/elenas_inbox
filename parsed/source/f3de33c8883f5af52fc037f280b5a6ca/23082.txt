TEXT:
TWO crack White House staffers responded to this morning's Daily Report
reminder with these pieces of wisdom:

On staying healthy:
"When writing about the food, don't forget to warn against drinking open
beverages from vendors - many of whom water down drinks and fill empty
bottles with excess - causing unsuspecting tourists to get Montezuma's
Revenge. "

On staying happy:
"I have little to add other than to remind you that Honduras, and to a
growing extent Nicaragua, are making some of the finest cigars in the
world.  No better way for him to top off that meal."

Don't forget to turn your bullets in for the Daily Report by 4:00 pm.
'.-    r.,
