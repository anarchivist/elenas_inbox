TEXT:
THanks. We need to do the same with OVP, right? HHS called to say they
have changes, that this is a very sensitive political doument, that
they'll give me their comments in the a.m., etc .... sigh. Bruce said o.k.
to get out in a.m.   FYI I'm scheduling your
liability/litigation/disclosure group for Monday instead of FDA rule
group.   (Jerry and I are supposed to go to Maine Sat for the week w/his
family -- we've scrapped that, but Bruce thought Jerry or both of us still
might be able to take weekend and Monday off without any problem. We'll
see how tomorrow goes.)
