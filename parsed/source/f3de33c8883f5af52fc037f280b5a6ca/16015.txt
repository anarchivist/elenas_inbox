  TEXT:
  Crime/Drug Types:

  With respect to General McCaffrey's request to have a Rose Garden signing
  for this bill, I thought I'd sum-up where we are so that we could all be
  on the same page before the 3pm Chief of Staff meeting. Here goes:

  1. McCaffrey would like to see an event before Congress goes out and by
  early next week at the latest. He/his staff feels its a great opportunity
  for a bipartisan drug event focused on community coalitions (the bill
  passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate) .

  2.  Peter thinks its a positive, "feel good" event, and that we're    making
  strides with House appropriators on making sure that the bill will    get
  funded.  If we get fairly solid assurances on funding -- and there    are no
  Senate objections -- he thinks we should look to do an event early    next
  week.

  3. Tracey was checking with Daschle's folks on what they thought, but she
  had concerns that Senate Dems thought we would be letting the R's off the
  hook pretty easy ($10 million in grant authorizations for community
  coalitions next year) by doing a bipartisan drug event when we can't get
  them to support our larger drug/prevention efforts.

  4.  I spoke to Chris Putala in Biden's office who thought that if Hatch
  and Grassley are interested in a bill signing, we should first try and get
  some "bipartisan" assurances from them on including prevention/after
  schools in the Juvie bill. The way it looks now, only Specter is likely
  to vote with us, so we need at least one more vote.

  FINAL ANALYSIS:      While this is generally a positive event for us to do,


    we should think twice about giving the R's any credit without some measure
    of support on appropriating funds -- or if we know they're not going to be
    with us on the Juvie prevention amendment the following week.  In we do
    the event without these assurances, we should use the speech to hold the
    R's accountable on our drug/prevention related priorities (i.e., juvie prev
    ention, safe and drug-free schools, media campaign, ONDCP reauthorization,
    etc. )

    Any thoughts ...
    Jose'
