Congress Eyes Unspent Welfare Money

                            By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unspent welfare money totaling
                            billions of dollars is proving tempting to some
in Congress who
                            want to reclaim the cash windfall from the
states.

                            It's causing a fight among Republicans who want
the money for
                            disaster relief and education, and others who
argue they must
                            keep promises made during the welfare debate
just three years
                            ago, and let states spend as they see fit.

                            --We made a deal, "   House Ways and Means
Committee
                            Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, wrote to Senate
Majority
                            Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.   --As state
legislatures confront the
                            toughest challenges of welfare reform, Congress
is proposing to
                            pull the rug from under them."

                            And Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, a Republican,
said he
                            and other governors will fight any raid on state
money.

                            --There is no question that the Congress made a
pledge, a
                            promise, "   Thompson said Tuesday.   --How can you
ever· be
                            trusted again if on such a serious issue as this
you give your


                          word and give your pledge, and then you go back
on it?   I   I




                          Americans have left the welfare rolls more
quickly than anyone
                          predicted, leaving states with extra money not
spent on welfare
                          checks. A strong economy helped people find
jobs, and tougher
                          rules discouraged people from staying on
assistance.

                          But the amount the federal government gives to
states was based
                          on earlier years when case loads were much
higher. Under the
                          1996 federal welfare overhaul, a total of $16.5
billion is put in
                          federal accounts earmarked for states each year.
Many states
                          have saved the money in case the economy turns
down, and
                          many say it will be needed to provide more inten
sive services for
                          welfare recipients who need the most help
getting off welfare.

                          At the end of September, after two years under
the new system,
                          more than $3 billion promised to the states was
sitting unused in
                          federal accounts.

                          In the Senate, an emergency spending bill would
use $350
                          million of that money. And in the House, a
Republican
                          instrumental in crafting the 1996 welfare law
wants to let states
                          use their welfare money for education programs
that may have
                          nothing to do with the poor.

                          That would let Republicans support popular
school programs
                          without having to find any new cash, responding
to President
                          Clinton's education initiatives while still
allowing for a tax cut.

                          Neither proposal is going over well with other
Republicans who
                          helped shape the 1996 welfare law, which
fundamentally
                          changed how the nation aids its poor.

                          The federal government used to set the rules and
promised to
                          help pay the benefits of each person who
qualified for


                          assistance. Under the new system, states agreed
to live with a
                          set level of funding in exchange for enormous
flexibility in
                          creating their programs.

                          Like Thompson, Archer warned that future
attempts to turn
                          education, child protection, housing, food and
health programs
                          into similar "block grants"      to states will
fail if Congress breaks
                          the welfare deal. Indeed, opponents of the
welfare overhaul had
                          warned that Congress would raid welfare money
when it hit a
                          financial crunch.

                          "If Congress cannot be trusted to keep its word
... it will be all
                          but impossible to enact additional reforms,"
said Archer's letter
                          to Lott, also signed by other welfare overhaul
leaders, Reps.
                          Clay Shaw, R-Fla., and Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.

                          In the Senate, Appropriations Committee Chairman
Ted
                          Stevens, R-Alaska, wants to use $350 million to
help provide
                          disaster relief to the Central American victims
of Hurricane
                          Mitch.

                          States that have spent all their welfare money
wouldn't be
                          punished, but those with money left would lose a
portion. The
                          biggest loser would be New York, which would
forfeit more
                          than $79 million of the $689 million it has
still unspent.

                          Meanwhile, House Budget Committee Chairman John
Kasich,
                          who was central to creation of the 1996 welfare
overhaul,
                          introduced a plan Tuesday to let states use
their welfare money
                          for education programs"    such as building new
schools or hiring
                          more teachers.

                          " I t should be as broadly based on education as
possible, "    said
                          Bruce Cuthbertson, spokesman for Kasich, who is
seeking the
                          GOP presidential nomination.

                          Even Republicans who support flexibility in


federal funding reject
                         that.

                         "Using it for school construction and things of
that nature is a
                         nonstarter, "   said Archer's spokesman, Trent
Duffy.

                         Thompson agreed: "You've got to be in the realm
of what's
                         good for the welfare clientele.' ,
