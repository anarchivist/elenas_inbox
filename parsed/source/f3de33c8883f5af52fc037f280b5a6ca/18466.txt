 TEXT:
 I spoke to Barbara Chow this afternoon, and she is still insisting on a
 separate measure for earnings gain (not combined with job retention for a
 "success in the workplace" measure). Thus, we are at loggerheads, and, as
 Diana has outlined below, after we have moved to try to accomodate their
 concerns.

 In the meantime, OIRA is suggesting we have an Elena-Olivia-Barbara Chow
 meeting tomorrow to discuss this -- i.e, see if we can all work this out
 without having an EOP position. This is a bit dangerous, because OMB and
 HHS agree here, but it could also move the ball forward.  What do you think
 ?

 On another matter, Barbara Chow is also holding firm on changing the child
 support budget language -- as you suggested, I made a pitch for --

 "The Administration will hold a dialogue with the stakeholders of the
 child support program to look at ways to address these problems, and work
 with members of Congress to prepare legislation." or work with members of
 Congress on legislation."

  instead of "in working with members of Congress, will prepare
 legislation. "

 Subject:         hi perf notes -- as an attachment and attached

 Attached is a straight chronology, followed by an attempt (after the
 asterisks) to layout an argument: that we've moved to implement the deal
 we struck with them (they would drop welfare exit if we would drop
 earnings gain), and they still won't compromise. Charts are slightly hard


 to do because most of the time there is no OMB position to measure
 ourselves against.  But I think the best argument is that we agreed on a
 trade and that we have delivered on it.  Now we are arguing about
 window-dressing.
