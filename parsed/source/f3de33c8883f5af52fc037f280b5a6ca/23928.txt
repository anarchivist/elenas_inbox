Fann workers are among the poorest and most vulnerable in our society: Average annual earnings
offann worker families are only about $6,500 and fann workers are employed on average only about
26 weeks per year.

The H-2A "guest worker" program admits temporary nonimmigrant agricultural workers to provide
fanners with an adequate supply oflaborers during the peak periods in the growing season, ifthere is
an inadequate supply of domestic workers. There is no cap on the number ofH-2A visas granted
annually. Currently, there are 1.6 million hand-harvest farm workers in the U.S. of which it is
estimated that approximately 600,000 are undocumented, 1 million are legal (citizens or authorized
resident labor), and 35,000 are in the H-2A program.

Employer Obligations

Under the current program, in order to hire H-2A workers, an employer must demonstrate to
the Department of Labor (DOL) that:

       (a) there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to perform
       the services; and,

       (b) there will be no adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of
       similarly-employed U.S. workers.

To meet these criteria, employers are required to:

     ./   engage in positive recruitment efforts;
     ./   pay workers the higher of the minimum wage, locally prevailing wage, or an
          "adverse effect wage rate" (AEWR), the average wage paid to non-managerial
          agricultural workers in the state;
     ./   provide free and safe housing to workers coming from outside the commuting area;
     ./   reimburse workers' inbound transportation if they complete half the contract,
          outbound also if they complete the contract; and,
     ./   guarantee 3/4 of the hours of the contract the grower offers; and,
     ./   hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies during the first half of the work contract.


Administration Principles on Reform

The H-2A program has been heavily criticized by the GAO, DOL's IG, and the Hill primarily due to
the administrative burdens placed on growers and its failure to adequately protect workers. As a
result, Congress has proposed many different bills to restructure the H-2A program.

The Administration has acknowledged problems with the program and is working administratively
(through administrative actions and the regulatory process) to reengineer and streamline the H-2A
program to ease application burdens while maintaining strong worker protections. The
Administration does not believe that legislation is necessary or appropriate at this time.

The Administration's guiding principles in refonning the H-2A program are to create a system:

     ./   with procedures that are simple and the least burdensome for growers;
     ./   which assures an adequate labor supply for growers in a predictable and timely manner;
     ./   that provides a clear and meaningful first preference for U.S. farm workers and that
          diminishes reliance on foreign workers;
     ./   which avoids the transfer of costs and risks from businesses to low wage workers;
     ./   that encourages longer periods of employment for legal U.S. workers; and,
     ./   which assures decent wages and working conditions for domestic and foreign farm
          workers, and that nonnal market forces work to improve wages, benefits, and working
          conditions.

The Admiriistration is committed to improving the H-2A program to assure growers of an adequate,
predictable labor supply while protecting U.S. farm workers who are among the poorest and most
vulnerable in our society.

FY 2000 Budget Initiative

     The President's pending Budget requests $10 million to fund America's Agricultural Labor
     Network ("AgNet") that would benefit growers and workers by having an efficient
     alternative mechanism to match workers with employment opportunities. AgNet
     would serve as an information broker through an electronic system that allows both
     growers to find workers and workers to find employment opportunities that meet
     their needs (e.g., location, duration, type of crop, etc.).

H-2A Regulatory Reform

     DOL will soon publish a final regulation that will complete an earlier proposal to:

     -reduce the length of time that employers must file an H-2A application from 60 to 45 days
     before the date when employees are needed;

     -reduce the deadline for when employer-provided housing must be available for inspection
     before the date of need; and,

     -modifY the requirement that certified H-2A employers provide notice of the exact date on
     which H-2A employees have departed for the place of employment.

     INS will soon issue a final regulation that will complete an earlier proposal to delegate H-2A
     petitioning authority to DOL. This proposed change would significantly reduce the burden to
     growers when filing for H-2A workers by removing an entire step from the current process.

     DOL has also made additional administrative changes to the H-2A program such as
     modifications to the positive recruitment requirement. DOL intends to consistently meet the
     existing 20 day deadline to issue approved certifications for growers.
