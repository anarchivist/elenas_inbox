TEXT:
Elena,
I just received a message from Earl Gohl at the Labor Department.  This
afternoon, the Labor Department was asked by the Immigration Subcommittee
of the House Judiciary Committee (Lamar Smith's committee) to testify on
April 21st on H1B visas.  According to Earl, they (unclear whether Oem. or
Rep.) intend to introduce an H1B bill before then.  This bill will include
what Earl calls "our two labor protections." I assume that he means the
H1B reforms of no lay-off and recruit and retain.  He is not sure what
else from Kennedy it will include.
I have put in a call to Peter and to Earl to follow up.

Julie
