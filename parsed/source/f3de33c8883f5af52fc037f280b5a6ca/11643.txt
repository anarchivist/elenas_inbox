TEXT:
The scheduling office received a letter inviting the President to attend
this event in New York on April 29. The President is not scheduled to be
in New York on this day. Anne Lewis commented to scheduling that she
thought it was worth discussing, and wanted to know what DPC thought.
Does anyone feel that we should consider this? Maybe a video or suggest a
surrogate?


Alan J. Patricof, Co-Chairman of Patricof and Company Ventures, and Lisa
Belzberg Bronfman, President of PENCIL, invite POTUS to participate in
PENCILO,s Fifth Annual Principal for a Day program by visiting a
participating New York City school and/or addressing the Principal for a
Day Town Meeting later that evening.
