TEXT:
In the face of unified opposition by all the farmer groups, the companies
backed down a bit -- a "stay of execution" as the farmers put it and won't
got to the contract system.    (Some of the farmers also said they turned
down free trips to the meeting on the company jets). They won't go to
contract buying this year, but the companies do plan to start a pilot
program next year.  The groups are gathering this month to put together a
proposal for reforming the quota system to send back to the companies.
Then Rod Kuegal (KY) would like to come talk to us, sometime around the
first of June.  While it is good for the farmers that the companies backed
down, it is obviously troubling that they are now cosnidering negotiating
compromises on the quota program.   I'm trying to gather more info.
