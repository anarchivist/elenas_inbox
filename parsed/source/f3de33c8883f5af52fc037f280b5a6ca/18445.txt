TEXT:
Julie Fernandes has figured out the best way to deal with the number of
testers question: HUD says some tests are done by the same people-- you
should talk about the number of tests not the number of people doing
them. This new program is about 500 tests nationwide (an average of 25
per area).  HUD urges this be a new number because this program is
essentially "taking the tempreture" of housing discrimination around the
country and can't be compared to prior programs.

When pushed, they said there are 50 programs/organizations they fund that
may be doing testing now, but it is complaint driven and they don't know
how many tests an individual organization does.
