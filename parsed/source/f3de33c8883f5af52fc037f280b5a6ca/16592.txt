      NEW DIABETES INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE TREATMENT, PREVENTION, AND
                   RESEARCH FOR AMERICANS WITH DIABETES

Today President Clinton announced that the balanced budget he signed into law on Tuesday
contains a package of investments that will improve the lives of the 16 million Americans who suffer
from diabetes. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) claims that "taken together, these new
investments in diabetes, announced by President Clinton today, are as important for people with
diabetes as the discovery of insulin in the 1920s."

(1)    An important new preventive Medicare benefit which will help the millions of older
       Americans who suffer from diabetes better manage their treatment, thereby helping avoid
       serious and costly complications of diabetes;

(2)    A new $150 million investment in diabetes research to be allocated by HHS Secretary
       Donna Shalala for finding ways to prevent and cure Type I (often known as juvenile)
       Diabetes;

(3)    A $150 million investment for prevention, treatment for Native Americans with diabetes; and

(4)     A government sponsored effort with the private sector to develop medical criteria that will
        guide diabetes patients, health plans, and health providers across America and help
      . consumers receive appropriate quality care.

A New Medicare Benefit to Help People With Diabetes Better Manage Their Care
The balanced budget expands Medicare's coverage of benefits for people with diabetes by an
estimated $2.1 billion over five years. Previously, Medicare covered diabetes outpatient
self-management training only in hospital-based programs. Under the new balanced budget, more
Medicare beneficiaries will be able to take advantage of outpatient self-management training by
expanding coverage furnished by physicians and other certified providers. It would also expand
Medicare coverage of all blood glucose monitors (including testing strips)    to all beneficiaries with
diabetes, whereas Medicare currently only covers insulin-dependent patients.

Diabetes self-management education is an essential component of diabetes care. Expanding the
number of people eligible for these important self-management tools will increase the number of
Americans who are properly managing their diabetes, thereby helping prevent the debilitating and
costly complications too often associated with diabetes.

A New $150 Million Investment to Help Research a Cure for Type I (Juvenile) Diabetes.
This new investment provides $30 million annually for five years for research to help find the cure
for diabetes. The HHS Secretary will have discretion to target these funds to the HHS
agencies that can fund the best available scientific opportunities. Children who develop
diabetes should not have to suffer the devastating consequences of this disease. Studies show that
even those who receive the best treatment and care may suffer from many severe complications.
Only when we find a cure will people with Type I diabetes truly live in peace. In FY 1997, HHS
will spend an estimated $345 million on diabetes research at the National Institutes of Health,

Centers for Disease Control, and Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. The new
diabetes initiative will enable HHS to increase its annual funding for diabetes research by
nearly 10 percent.
$150 Million Investment to Help Prevent and Treat Diabetes Among Native Americans. The new
funding provided IHS ($30 million annually for five years) will be used to provide services for
diabetes prevention and treatment in partnership with Tribes, Urban Indian Health Centers, IHS
Facilities, and other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), such as
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new diabetes program, which will have a
special focus on children and youth, will test community-based outreach programs in an effort to
increase knowledge about such primary prevention techniques as reducing obesity, promoting health
and wellness, and reducing the onset of Type II diabetes. In accomplishing these objectives, the
new program will seek to improve linkages between families, public health service~, schools, and
nutrition programs.

A New Diabetes QuaJity Improvement Project
There are numerous studies by organizations such as the ADA and National Committee on Quality
Assurance (NCQA) that have documented that many physicians are not delivering the care known
to reduce diabetes complications such as blindness and amputation in order to diminish the personal
toll of diabetes. Today the President is announcing a major year-long collaborative effort to
develop a set of performance and outcome measures for people with diabetes. Such measures
could detail the care that should be delivered (for example, an annual eye exam) or health outcome
that should be achieved (such as blood glucose levels). These new criteria would help ensure that
physicians have the necessary information to provide patients with high quality diabetes care, and
thereby help avoid costlier complications later.

The performance and outcome measures are being developed by a coalition of four organizations:
HCFA, the largest purchaser of health care for the diabetic population; the ADA, the largest and
leading voluntary health agency dedicated to improving the lives of people with diabetes; NCQA,
which develops and maintains a set of standardized performance measures used by more than 90
percent of health plans; and the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT) are dedicated to ensuring
that consumers have adequate information to make health care decisions. Together, these
organizations will work to ensure that millions of consumers, purchasers, and health care providers
adopt these new criteria.

                DIABETES: WHO IT AFFECTS AND THE COSTLY COMPLICATIONS

Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death.   Middle-aged Americans with diabetes have death rates
twice as high as other Americans.

More likely to suffer from heart disease, high blood pressure, and more likely to suffer from strokes.
People with diabetes are 2 to 4 times more likely to suffer from cardiovascular disease, and middle
aged Americans are about 2 to 4 times more likely to die of heart disease and 2 to 4 times more at risk
for a stroke. High blood pressure affects nearly two-thirds of people with diabetes.

The leading cause of end-stage renal disease, non-traumatic amputations, and blindness.
Thirty-six percent of new end-stage renal disease (ERSD) cases are people with diabetes, causing
20,000 Americans to develop this disease each year. 54,000 amputations are performed on diabetics
each year, and up to 24,000 adults are blinded each year from diabetes.

The National Institutes of Health estimates that we spend $92 billion per year on diabetes care.    ($45
billion is costs directly attributable to diabetes, whereas $47 billion is indirect medical costs, such as
work loss, disability, and premature death).

DIABETES AND MEDICARE

Of the 8 million diagnosed with diabetes, 3.2 million are adults age 65 and over. Approximately
40-45 percent of persons age 65 years of age or older have either Type II diabetes or Impaired
Glucose Tolerance (IGT). Approximately half of all diabetes cases occur in people older than 55
years of age.

Twenty thousand Americans develop end stage renal disease from diabetes in 1992 and this number
continues to climb each year. Medicare pays for ERSD for the non-elderly population as well.
Medicare expenditures per person with diabetes on kidney dialysis averages $38,700 annually.

NATIVE AMERICANS AND DIABETES

Diabetes occurs at rates dramatically higher among AllAN than in the general U.S. population. One
third to one half of adults in various tribal groups have diabetes (420,000 to 630,000 individuals). The
death rate from diabetes is 2.7 times higher in the AIlAN population than in the U.S. population.

Native Americans develop type II diabetes at a younger age -- as young as age eight -- and suffer
higher rates of complications including blindness, vascular insufficiency leading to amputation, and
ESRD.             .

TYPE I DIABETES

Between 700,000 and 1 million Americans have Type I diabetes and as many as half of these are
children. Each year about 30,000 new Americans -- many of whqm are children -- are diagnosed
with Type I diabetes.
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

Almost all Americans with Type I diabetes will likely suffer from at least one of the many complications
from diabetes, including serious eye disease (e.g. blindness), amputation, heart disease, or kidney
disease.
