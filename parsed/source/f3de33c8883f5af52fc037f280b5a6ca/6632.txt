Honorable Lamar Smith
Chairman, Subcommittee
    Immigration and Claims
Committee on the Judiciary
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Smith:

        This letter presents the views of the Department of Labor on H.R.
2377, entitled O&Temporary Agricultural Worker Act of 1997.08 This bill
would establish a pilot program to provide another means to bring foreign
workers into the United States to provide temporary or seasonal
agricultural services.

        The Department of Labor opposes enactment of H.R. 2377.  As the
General Accounting Office (GAO) has recently reported, the existing
temporary foreign agricultural worker program already assures an adequate
and dependable labor supply for agricultural producers, while it seeks to
protect the employment, compensation and working conditions of the U.S.
agricultural labor force.   As with any program, there are difficulties in
implementing the H-2A program. However, none of these difficulties
require legislation; all can be effectively addressed administratively.
The GAO made several such recommendations that the administering agencies
have agreed to take the necessary steps to implement.

         Consistent with the findings and recommendations of two
bi-partisan commissions -- the Commission on Agricultural Workers and the
Commission on Immigration Reform -- the President opposes a new
guestworker program. He has, however, directed that, if efforts to halt
illegal immigration contribute to agricultural labor shortages, the
Departments of Agriculture and Labor should work cooperatively to improve
and enhance existing programs to meet the labor requirements of our vital
agricultural industry consistent with our obligations to American
workers.  The recent GAO report found that O&le supplies of farm labor
appear to be available in most areas,08 although there is some possibility


of localized shortages relating to specific crops or geographic areas.

        In response to concerns regarding localized shortages, the
Departments of Agriculture and Labor have held discussions under the aegis
of the Domestic Policy council to determine means of streamlining the
current H-2A program to make it more responsive to the needs of
agricultural producers, and more effective in protecting u.s. workers.   In
addition to changes in the program that respond to GAO recommendations
such as shortening the lead time on submitting H-2A applications from 60
to 45 days, other possible H-2A program changes are being considered that
address issues contained in H.R. 2377. These include reducing the lead
time for completing housing inspections from 30 to 20 days prior to date
of need; providing expedited certification for employers who reduce their
use of H-2A workers by 25 percent or more over the previous year; and
other changes to strengthen worker protections arid enforcement.

        In view of the PresidentD,s position, the GAOD,s findings and
accepted recommendations, and the cooperative efforts of the Departments
of Agriculture and Labor to develop ways to administratively restructure
the H-2A program, the Administration is strongly opposed to H.R. 2377.
Furthermore, if H.R. 2377 were passed by the Congress and presented to the
President, I would recommend that he veto the bill.

        The Office of Management and Budget advises

                                                Sincerely,



                                                Alexis M. Herman====================
