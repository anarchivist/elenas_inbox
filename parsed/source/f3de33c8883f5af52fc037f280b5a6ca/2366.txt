     Dear Friends:

             I am writing to thank you for your tireless efforts to promote the public health. I admire
     your efforts on issues ranging from cancer research funding to reducing teen smoking to
     encouraging Americans to eat healthier diets. I regret that I cannot be with all of you in Los
     Angeles for your annual meeting and wish you the best of luck.

             As you know, the President and I are committed to drastically reducing the number of
     young people who get addicted to the deadly habit of cigarette smoking. We feel that the
     agreement reached with the Attorneys General and the tobacco industry last June represents an
     unprecedented opportunity to truly change the face of this epidemic. As you would agree, the
     President and I will not support any legislation that does not include: a comprehensive plan to
     reduce youth smoking, including tough financial penalties on tobacco companies if reductions in
     youth smoking are not met; full authority to regulate cigarettes by the FDA; changes in the way
     the tobacco industry does business, including ending the marketing and promoting of tobacco
     products to kids and requiring the disclosure of certain industry documents; investing in other
     public health goals and protecting farmers and their communities. No legislation is better than
     any legislation that allows the tobacco industry to continue to hook thousands of kids to their
     deadly products every year.

             As you may know, the President asked me to travel around the country to get ideas and
     build support for this effort. I have met with young people and their parents, public health
     experts, doctors, nurses, police officers and teachers in Florida, in Iowa and in Washington, D.C.
      From these meetings I have gained new insights and have a newfound respect for the efforts to
     reduce youth smoking that are happening at the local levels. I look forward to continuing these
     meetings in other parts of the country and bringing what I learn back to Washington, D.C. so that
     I can push for legislation that will truly make a positive difference for millions all Americans. I
     support a very open and honest discussion on this important issue and look forward to working
     with Congress this winter.

            I very much appreciate all the work that you all have done and look forward to working
     with you in the future. Best of luck with your conference.
