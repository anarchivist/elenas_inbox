Subject:         Letter clearance

Here's my proposed draft for the Anthony Pilla letter we emailed about
previously:

Thank you for your most recent letter regarding the issue of late term
abortion.  While I continue to opposed late-term abortions except, as
the Supreme Court requires, where necessary to protect the life or
health of the mother, I believe the procedure should be permitted as a
last resort when doctors judge it necessary to save a woman's life or
to avert serious consequences to her health.

I am aware of the recent statements by the American Medical
Association, and I respect their expertise and knowledge.   However,
members of the medical community with whom I consulted during my
struggle with this issue advised me that, in those rare cases where a
woman's serious health interests are at stake, the decision regarding
whether to use the procedure should be left to the best exercise of a
physician's medical judgment.  For that reason, I remain opposed to
H.R. 1122.

I appreciate your continuing counsel on this complex and sensitive
issue.

This was taken from a letter signed by the President to Joe Bennett, an
old
friend from Arkansas, in 10/96.
