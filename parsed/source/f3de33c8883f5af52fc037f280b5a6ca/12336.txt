     I have reviewed this roll-out proposal. with some edits, I think this
     document is fine but I agree with the sentiment that I think was expressed
     by you at the race book meeting last week - ie. we don't know what the
     final book will look like and how the final product will be received and
     therefore it seems premature to make a final decision about the roll-out
     plan.

     hi. please find attached a draft of our options memo for your review and

     However, if there are strong preferences for another option, please let us
     know.  We are looking to submit this memo by COB today. Please feel free
     to contact us if any questions. Thank you.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BEN JOHNSON
               KATHLEEN AHN

SUBJECT:       BOOK ROLL OUT STRATEGY/ONE AMERICA EVENT


I.       INTRODUCTION

The release of your book/report to the nation, which was committed to as part of your
Initiative on Race, provides a unique opportunity to frame both the past and the future
of your lifelong effort to build bridges between people of different backgrounds. It
offers a chance to recap the many accomplishments of the Initiative and its Advisory
Board and to close that chapter. Likewise, this release offers an occasion for you to
lay the foundation, personally, for the next chapter - the final efforts of your
administration to close opportunity gaps and promote racial reconciliation.

While, in some respects, the new chapter officially started with the announcement of
the White House Office on the President's Initiative for One America, an event around
the book release would be your first statement on the creation of your new office and
your intentions for it. The release of the book also would serve as a link or transition
between the work of Initiative and the new office, in terms of policy and in terms of
community efforts, both of which your book addresses.

This memo describes the activities that should take place prior to the release of your
book, in order for the rollout and the book to be most effective. In addition, we have
provided you with several options for events at which the book could be released. Only
one of those options, Option E, focuses narrowly on the book. The other options focus
more broadly on the book and its context, as described above.

II.      PRE ROLL-OUT

A)       Confidential Review

We recommend that a small group of your top confidantes receive a copy of the book
for confidential review as far in advance of the roll-out as possible. Their feedback will
be invaluable in the final editing as well as in planning for the marketing and rollout.
Please find below some suggested names. We recommend that this group be no
greater than 5-7 individuals.

Mary Francis Berry                       Bill Lann Lee
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
Taylor Branch                            Angela Oh
Henry Cisneros                           Federico Pena
Andrew Cuomo                             Rodney Slater
John Hope Franklin                       Vice President
AI From                                  Gov. William Winter
Bill Galston
Alexis Herman

B)     Media Outreach

We recommend a press roundtable with 3-4 key reporters who have covered the
initiative regularly since the June 1997 commencement address. This roundtable
would give you the opportunity to discuss directly address (1) the achievements of your
Initiative on Race (2) your expectations for the new WH Office on the President's
Initiative for One America, and (3) the connection between your overall policy initiatives
and efforts to close opportunity gaps that affect people of color. At the same time, you
would lay the foundation for the roll-out.

We would draw from the following list of reporters:

Bill Douglas - Newsday                   Mimi Hall - USA Today
Jodi Enda - Knight Ridder                Steve Holmes - NY Times
Michael Fletcher - WP                    Sonya Ross - AP
Sam Fulwood - LA Times                   Ann Scales - Boston Globe

C)     Validators

We recommend that a broad group of individuals who can serve as validators and
surrogates to the media and the public be briefed on the contents of the book and the
rollout plan. With your approval, we would contact these individuals a day or two prior
to the book's release. (We have attached a list for your review.)

D)     Book Distribution

We need to finalize a distribution strategy for the book as soon as possible, before
moving ahead with a rollout plan. A decision to sell the book at retail outlets versus
through the GPO presents different considerations for the rollout plan.

III.   ROLL-OUT OPTIONS

A)     WH South Lawn or East Room event I Cabinet members at various sites

You would speak to a large audience on the South Lawn or a smaller group in the East
Room. Audience members would be mutliracial - African Americans, American
Indians, Asian Americans, Hispanics, and whites -- and w9uld include people from
around the country and from organizations that have worked with the Race Initiative to
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
further your goal of achieving One America.

On the same day, Cabinet members would host events in cities across the country
where your Race Initiative sparked efforts to promote racial reconciliation.

The large event on the South Lawn, similar to the Arab-Israeli Peace signing would
maximize the number of people in attendance and allow significant diversity in the
audience and the stage. The East Room provides a more intimate setting.

The Cabinet events would build on the accomplishments of different efforts in cities to
fight intolerance and promote diversity. This option highlights your efforts, the
Administration efforts, as well as community efforts toward reconciliation.

B)    Outside Beltway Event I Cabinet members at various cities

This option is similar to option A, except you would deliver your speech to an audience
outside of D.C. In choosing a site, we would look for a location where, as a result of
your Race Initiative, efforts are underway to further your goal of achieving One America.

As in option A, Cabinet members would host events on the same day in cities across
the country where your Race Initiative sparked efforts to promote racial reconciliation.

Option B calls attention to the same themes as option A, but, by spotlighting a specific
example, places the emphasis on what a community can accomplish, working together.

C)    White House East Room I Sectoral Leaders events

You would speak to sectoral leaders and invited others, convened in the East Room,
following a half-day of simultaneous mini-conferences in DC hosted by the various
sectoral leadership groups. These mini-conferences would be organized in
conjunction with your office on the President's initiative for One America. Each would
focus on the workplan detailed in your book and how the specific sector could
implement a course of action.

Before your speech, you would meet privately with the sectoral leaders hosting events
to hear about the efforts they plan to undertake.

We recommend that 3 sectors be selected to host mini-conferences from among the
following communities: education, faith, organized labor, legal, human rights
commissions, and the media.

Option C highlights efforts started during the Race Initiative and continuing through your
Office for the President's Initiative on One America to mobilize various communities to
help bridge racial divides. This option enables sectoral groups to demonstrate their
ongoing commitment to achieving one America, while focusing more specifically on the
book than Options A or B.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
D)    White House Conference on One America

You would speak to participants of a WH Conference on One America, similar to the
WH Hate Crimes Conference. The conference would feature panels, presentations,
and discussions on the challenges toward building One America -- such closing gaps in
education, healthcare, civil rights enforcement, economic empowerment and police
conduct -- as well as efforts that are underway to promote racial reconciliation.

Option D shines a spotlight, again, on issues raised during your Initiative of last year
and in the book. These are the same issues your Administration and your new White
House Office on the President's Initiative for One America are attempting to address.

In order to be successful, the conference must advance these issues beyond where the
Initiative, at least, left them. The planning to achieve that objective as well as to
arrange the logistics for such a conference would require putting the book release off
for several months, at best.

E)    Book release in WH East Room

You would announce your book's release to a multiracial audience with Cabinet
members behind you. You would speak almost exclusively about the book and its
retease.

Option E emphasizes the book, over the context in which it was developed.

RECOMMENDATION

We recommend that you choose option A, WH event with Cabinet members hosting
events in cities around the country.     We suggest the White House site be the South
Lawn, which would allow for a truly inclusive event - A Celebration of One America".
The imagery of you, America's President, at America's house with representatives of at!
of America's people is fitting for your vision for unity.

We believe that the combination of a WH South Lawn event and successful local
events led by Cabinet Secretaries would highlight the accomplishments of your Initiative
on Race -- dialogues, policies and actions in local communities.     Such a combination
of events also looks forward to the continued work of your Administration to close
opportunity gaps that affect people of color. That work, spearheaded by your policy
shops and your new White House Office on the President's Initiative on One America,
will involve individuals attending the WH event, individuals attending the Cabinet events
and individuals like them in every American community. Your book would offer these
individuals a guide to what the future could look like and how they can get there.
