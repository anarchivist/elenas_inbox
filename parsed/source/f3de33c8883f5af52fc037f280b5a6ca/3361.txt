TEXT:
genetic screening is on for Monday -- and Jen is right, it is the genetic"
screening program which includes Shalala, victim, Slaughter and POTUS.
Erskine wanted to kill pediatric labelling b/c he wanted it included in
the immunization event on the 23rd b/c he and scheduling felt that was the
day of child health messages and we" should just pile them all into one.  I
think they realize now that combining it with the 23rd event is a bad
idea, so now we can try to get it on the schedule for August but there is
no guarantee. So, again, I think the best bet for a pediatric labelling
hit is to push for a Radio Address.
