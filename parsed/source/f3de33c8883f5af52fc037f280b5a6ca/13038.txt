On Friday, I circulated to you for review and comment testimony from Joel
Klein
for a hearing tomorrow morning before the House Judiciary Committee on
legislation that would create an antitrust exemption for certain
physicians.
JUSTICE strongly opposes the legislation. Also, the FTC has publicly
opposed
this legislation.

Justice is anxious·to get its statement to the Committee - please give me
your
comments/signoff by no later than 3:00 p.m. today. Thanks.
