WE ARE SENDING THE SENATE DEFENSE FLOOR SAP WITHIN A FEW t-lINUTES (ON
SENATE FLOOR NOW).  CALL ME IMMEDIATELY AT 5-4790 IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS.

    S. 2132 -- DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsor:  Stevens (R), Alaska)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
Administrationo,s views on S. 2132, the Department of Defense
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee. Your consideration of the Administrationo,s views would be
appreciated.

        The Committee has developed a bill providing requested funding for
many of the Administrationo,s priorities. We appreciate the Committeeo,s
decision to fully fund the military pay raise and readiness programs at
requested levels. Also, we are pleased that most of the modernization
priorities of the Departme.nt of Defense are funded at or near requested
levels. However, the Administration is disappointed that the Senate,
based on OMB's preliminary scoring, has provided $475 million below the
President's overall request for this bill due to increases in lower
priority military construction projects. Also, as discussed below, the
Administration has serious concerns about certain provisions included in
the Committee bill, which must be addressed satisfactorily as the bill
moves through the process.

Funding for Bosnia

        The Administration regrets that the Committee did not include
funding for our ongoing operations in Bosnia. U.S. military presence,
albeit at lower force levels, is critical for continued progress in
implementing the Dayton Peace Accords.  Although funding requirements for
operations in Bosnia were not known when the FY 1999 Budget was prepared,
the Administration created a funding reserve in the budget to cover these
costs, and on March 3, 1998, the President requested funding for this
purpose. A secure funding source at the start of the fiscal year allows
the Department to manage its readiness accounts effectively throughout the
year. The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide emergency
funding in the Defense Appropriations bill to support the U.S. troops in
Bosnia.

Unrequested Funding

        The Committee bill increases funding for programs that due to
higher priority military requirements are not in the Future Years Defense
Program (FYDP), or, that should not be funded at the expense of DoDO,s FY
1999 requirements. These increases include $50 million for continued
operation and modification of excess B-52 bombers, $255 million for three
additional C-130J airlift aircraft, $287 million for National Guard and
Reserve equipment (not including C-130 aircraft), $94 million for the
Space Based Laser program, and $50 million for advance procurement of the
LHD-8 amphibious ship. Moreover, to complete procurement of the LHD-8,
extensive funding will be required in later years.  These increases would
be at the expense of higher priority defense programs.

Reduction in Request for Intelligence Budget


        The Administration objects to the Committee's significant
reduction to the FY 1999 funding request for U.S. intelligence. The
Co~~itteeO,s reduction would slow the Administration's efforts to
strengthen our Intelligence capabilities. The Administration urges the
Senate to appropriate the full amount of the President's request to ensure
that the Intelligence Community can meet the most pressing needs of our
national policy makers and combatant commanders. The Director of Central
Intelligence will provide additional detail on these classified issues
prior to the conference on the Defense appropriations bill.

O&M Adjustments

         The Administration appreciates the billO,s emphasis on preserving
military readiness through strong funding of most O&M programs. However,
force readiness could be threatened by the billO,s reductions to other O&M
efforts, such as civilian personnel pay. The PresidentD,s request is very
tightly constructed within the discretionary caps agreed to in the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement. Any adjustments must be carefully evaluated
to ensure that sufficient funding is available for DoD operations and
support programs. The Administration is also concerned that additional
restrictions may be placed on O&M accounts that would further hinder the
ability of field level commanders to meet mission requirements quickly in
a constantly changing environment. The Administration would like to work
with the Congress to address these issues prior to final congressional
action on the bill.

Reduced Funding for the Next-Generation Aircraft Carrier

        The Committee bill would reduce funding for research and
development of CVX-78, the next-generation aircraft carrier, by $116
million, a 61-percent decrease from the presidentD,s request. A reduction
of this magnitude would jeopardize the Navy'S ability to design and
deliver new aircraft carrier technologies and would make it difficult to
achieve life-cycle cost reductions, a major goal of the aircraft carrier
development program. The Administration urges the Senate to restore
funding to this important development effort.

Reduced Funding for Dual Use R&D

        The Committee has provided $36 million for the Dual Use
Applications Program, $30 million below the President's request, and $73
million for the Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative, $30
million below the request.  The Administration urges full support of these
programs, which are needed to ensure that DoD systems employ technologies
used in

commercial products to good advantage. These dual-use technologies will
help lower production and support costs and help modernize many DoD
systems more readily than could be done through use of DOD-unique
technologies.

Next Generation Internet

        The Committee has provided only $30 million for Next Generation
Internet (NGI) funding, $10 million less than requested.  Funding this
program will support research into high-rate data networking technologies
that will be needed by DoD's information-intensive systems in the near
future.  The Administration urges full funding of the NGI request.

Potential Objectionable Amendments



        The Administration understands that several amendments may be
offered which would undermine the PresidentO,s prerogatives as
Commander-in-Chief and potentially harm U.S. national security. These
amendments would: prescribe a force drawdown in Bosnia; potentially
require prior congressional authorization of actions taken by the
President to protect our national security pursuant to his authority under
the Constitution; and, alter the current commercial satellite export
licensing jurisdictions of Executive Branch agencies. The presidentO,s
senior advisors would recommend veto of this bill if it includes
amendments such as these.
