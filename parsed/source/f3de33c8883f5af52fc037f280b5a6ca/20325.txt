      In no particular order, and preliminarily ...

      1. Youth gun signs/CAP legislation. We've considered supporting child
      access prevention legislation for some time (Durbin/Chafee have a bill)
      that would generally hold adults/parents liable if they allow kids easy
      access to guns. We could announce support for this bill (or a more
      limited version preferred by Justice) and unveil our signs warning gun
      purchasers about their responsibility to keep handguns away from
      children. Last June, the Pres. directed Treasury to require federal gun
      dealers to post such signs, and they are finally prepared to issue a final
      reg on this.

      2. Drug Strike Force. DOJ is prepared to announce -- ASAP -- that they
      will be dedicating some 300 federal agents and 20 prosecutors to form a
      drug strike force in Chicago. Mayor Daley has been pushing for the feds
      to focus more on drugs in Chicago, and the AG has finally agreed to shift
      more resources there. This would be a good hard-hitting drug
      announcement, and the VP is currently considering it.  However, we've
      committed to Daley to do it very soon.

      3. Drug Courts.   In last week's weekly, the President indicated that he
      wanted to do an event on drug courts. DOJ has $30 million this fiscal
      year for them, and grant applications were due this spring. Though I'm
      not sure, my guess is that we will be in a position to award some of these
      grants during the summer -- and they could serve as a basis for a drug
      courts event.

      4. Household Survey. ONDCP has indicated that the Household Survey --
      one of two major drug surveys on teen drug use -- should be out by
      August.  Last year's survey was the first to indicate a dip in teenage
      drug use, and this year's is likely to show the same.  If so, the survey's
..
     release could serve as an organizing point for another drug event.

     5.  Safe and Drug-Free Schools.  Ed has been sitting on a Safe and
     Drug-Free Schools report for some months now.  The latest word is that it·
     will be out in August.  I'm not too confident, and I'm not sure what the
     report will make news, but it could serve as a backdrop for talking about
     school safety.

     6. COPS in Schools. The Police/Schools grants we announced in March were
     due to DOJ this week.· It's likely that these will be ready to announce by
     the end of summer, along with the AG/Secretary of Ed's overall.
     recommendations for getting more police in and working with s·chools (per
     today's speech). Also, DOJ expects to use some of the COPS in Schools
     money to hold a big conference. We should try and time all three of these
     things.

     7. God and Gangs. The NRA may have Moses, but we're turning to the God
     of Abraham himself.  Rahmie's project to look for innovative (read
     constitutional) ways to fund faith-based anti-crime programs is under
     consideration at Justice.  In fact, Rahm spoke to Reno today about this.
     Hopefully, we will be in a position to announce a handful of demos by
     summer's end.

     8.  Smart Gun Challenge. Although, I am not crazy about it, Rahm really
     wants to do this. Justice and Treasury are okay w/uschallenging
     government and industry to work together to get a child proof gun on the
     market by 2000.  Ugh ... let's give this one to the Millennium folks.

     9. COPS, COPS, COPS. As always, there will be several opportunities to
     announce cop grants over the summer -- including meth cop grants and
     extensions for small cities. We could link one -- or both -- of these to
     a general COPS announcement, and continue to talk about falling crime
     rates.

     10.  Pulse Check. On June 25th, ONDCP and HHS are scheduled to release
     the biannual Pulse Check -- a survey of local law enforcement, treatment
     providers, ethnographers -- that describes what's going on in local drug
     markets.  For instance, heroin from Mexico is on the rise and cheap in
     Baltimore; meth is stable, but serious in St. Louis; crack is down and
     less available in NYC ... stuff like that. The survey is by no means a
     national sample of drug use/availability, and it usually only makes local
     news. Nonetheless, it gets some attention, gives specific descriptions of
     local drug problems, and gets some coverage.

     11. Media Campaign.   Just in case this is not already on the schedule, we
     should announce the national roll-out of the $195 million media campaign
     in July.  ONDCP would buy a "roadblock" on network TV that night, unveil
     new ads and host local events in scores of participating cities. Also, we
     may be able to release the new DUF/ADAM data that day, which measure drug
     use among the arrestees. Last year, the data showed meth use declining in
     key cities, and crack down.  There could be similar news this year.

     12. Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. July represents the 2nd
     anniversary of the President's gun tracing initiative. Last year, we
     released a report and announced that 10 new cities were being added (total
     27). This year the report is running late, but it may be a candidate for
     a good cops/guns/juvie hit by the end of the summer/early fall.  As you
     know, the President's budget this year asked for $28 million to expand
     this initiative and to hire 6 ATF agents in each of the cities to crack
     down on gun traffickers. The House approps subcommittee fully funded this

·
    request last week, but the Senate will probably not be as generous.   If we
    fight and get funds for this during the summer, this will be a huge
    victory -- and maybe worth doing an event with or without the report ... at
    least I think so ...
