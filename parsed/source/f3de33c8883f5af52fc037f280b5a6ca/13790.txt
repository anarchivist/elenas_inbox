TEXT:
There were some significant developments this week, which everyone probably saw
but which I'll memorialize anyway.
1. Dole introduced a campaign finance bill just before he resigned.   It's
basically a warmed-over version of a commission that he and Mitchell endorsed
back in 1990. The eight members would send to Congress recommendations on which
seven members agree. Congress would then vote on all the recommendations
together on an up-or-down basis (like the base-closing commission) .
2. House GOP efforts to work out the details of their package continued, with
the PAC ban the object of contention. Armey endorsed a ban but many members
disagree.
