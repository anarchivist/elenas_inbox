           Subject:         Comments on Tobacco draft

           The draft is good. We forgot to give you something on the settlement.
           Here are a few suggestions to put the EO in context.

           p. 1, graph 1: Today I want to talk to you about what we are doing to
           reduce smoking, especially by young people, and to protect Americans from
           the dangers of deadly ...

           p. 1, graph 3: Add a new second sentence, along the lines of "We told the
           tobacco companies to stop marketing to young people: sell to adults if
           you wish,  but draw the line at children."

           p. 1, graph 4: Here's the place to say more about our overall effort.
           Something like:

                   We must do more to protect all Americans from the dangers of smoking.
           The balanced budget I signed earlier this week includes a 15-cents-a-pack
           cigarette tax that will help states provide health care for up to 5
           million uninsured children, and help prevent many young people from taking
           up smoking in the first place. This fall, I hope we will begin an
           important national debate on additional measures we can enact to reduce
           smoking, especially by children.

                   I applaud the state attorneys general and public health advocates
           for providing us an extraordinary opportunity to build on our efforts on
           tobacco. One very important part of the attorneys generals' plan is a
           proposal by Rep. Henry Waxman of California to protect those who don't use
           tobacco from the threat of second-hand smoke.

           p. 1, graph 5: Drop the first sentence ("Many of us are offended ... " --
           sounds elitist) and the last sentence ("And of those deadly substances"
              no point apologizing for asbestos)

           p. 2, graph 1: Drop the last half of the last sentence (" ... and their
           efforts have improved the quality of life etc." -- makes it sound like
."
     what we're doing today is already donel
