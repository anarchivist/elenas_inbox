                    Discretionary Budget for the Department of Education
                                          Summary

TOTAL. This Budget is a 4.7 %, or $1.4 billion, increase over FY 1998, a total of$30.9 billion.
It funds important new initiatives, maintains or increases major base programs, and continues
progress on your previous commitments.

        While the increase is substantial, it is half the size of dollar increases Education received
each of the last two years. Still, it is a large increase given the caps, and we are working on
other investments on the mandatory side (such as school construction and class size).
Nevertheless, you can expect Secretary Riley to make a case for a much bigger discretionary
increase.

       Other than the new initiatives (already described), the budget includes:

Base Programs:

Education testing: $16 million. The full amount needed to maintain progress on test
development.

Pell Grants: $3,100 maximum. Increasing the maximum grant by $100 (3.3%) requires an
investment over FY 1998 of$289 million (3.9%). We could spend another $150 million to
increase the grant another $50; as already noted, doing so would take about $150 million that
could be used instead to increase our investments in the After-School program and Head Start.

America Read. $260 million. In FY 1998, Congress "advance appropriated" $210 million for
FY 1999 for the Education Department's portion of America Reads, contingent upon enactment
of the authorization bill, which has passed the House. The increase to $260 million reflects our
original first-year plan for the Education Department.

Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged. Grants to LEAs: $ 7.725 million. A $350 million,
4.5% increase over FY 1998 to serve an additional 400,000 children in poor communities. The
education groups will look at this line in the budget to see if we have made a sufficient
investment in base programs; Secretary Riley requested $492 million.

Goals 2000: $510 million. A $10 million increase over FY 1998, to maintain momentum in the
States for school reform.

Comprehensive School Reform: $175 million. A $30 million increase over FY 1998 for
demonstrations of school reform models. We hope to gain Congo Obey's support of our
Education Opportunity Zones by establishing a close linkage between his program and ours.

Adult Education: $394 million. A $33 million, 9% increase over FY 1998 for basic education
and English language training for the disadvantaged, immigrants, and welfare recipients. This is
part of the investment in improving education for Hispanic Americans.


Special Education: $4,811 million. This is the same as the FY 1998 level, which was increased
by $775 million over FY 1997. Secretary Riley will be particularly concerned about lack of an
FY 1999 increase. Weare convinced that no increase will satisfy the advocates, and would
prefer to negotiate this level in the context of competing demands in the appropriation bill, rather
than use up scarce funds in your Budget now.

College Work-Study, $915 million. A $85 million increase over FY 1998, to accelerate toward
your goal of 1 million Work-Study positions by FY 2000. With the reduction in Perkins loans
(below), this increase keeps the campus-based aid programs at level funding from FY 1998.

Reductions in the Base

A number of programs have been reduced to make room for initiatives and major base programs,
including: Impact Aid (-$92 million), the Education Block Grant (-$350 million), Perkins Loans
(-$85 million). Each ofthese, and others, has a vocal constituency. We believe we can make
the case that our funding of initiatives and base programs are all higher priority than these
programs.
