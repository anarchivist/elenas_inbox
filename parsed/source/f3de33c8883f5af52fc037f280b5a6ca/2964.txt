    TEXT:
    As you are aware, earlier this afternoon, I circulated a draft OMB letter
    to the Senate Finance Committee for comment by 2:30 p.m. today.   The
    letter addresses the Committee's mark up of welfare-related reconciliation
    language.

    The following paragraphs have been proposed for insert into the draft OMB
    letter.  Please provide me with comments on the insert, as well as the
    rest of the letter, by today's 2:30 p.m. deadline.

    Thank you for your assistance.
