TEXT:
By the way, I hope you are thinking of the farmers piece as a good ground
to attack Nickles on. He is evidently including Lugar as his farm
section.  This approach likely results in a windfall to companies as
prices decline (we've asked USDA for an estimate, preliminarily it would
be about $35 billion), removes any limits on the amount of tobacco grown
and leads to a decrease in the price of tobacco, and arguably fails to
protect the family farmer.
