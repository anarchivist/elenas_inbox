                        President Clinton: Helping to Keep Our Schools Safer
                                            April 23, 1999

    In a statement today, President Clinton will announce new assistance for the community of
    Littleton, Colorado and added resources for communities to help keep students safe at school.
    Specifically, he will announce: (1) up to $1.5 million in immediate funding from the Justice
    Department to assist the victims, their families, and the Littleton community with expenses
    relating to the recent school shooting; and (2) $70 million in Justice Department grants to help
    fund more than 600 school resource officers in 336 communities across the country.

    Expanding assistance to victims. In response to the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, and
    subsequent requests from Colorado authorities, the Justice Department will provide up to $1.5
    million in immediate funds from the Crime Victims' Fund to support:

                   Direct compensation to victims and their family members for funerals,
                   uncovered medical expenses, lost wages of parents, and private mental health
                   counseling for victims;

                   Additional personnel and overtime costs for critical incident stress
                   management services for first responders to the crisis; and

                   Added victims services and counseling personnel to help meet the immediate
                   and longer-term support needs of the community.

    Helping schools work with law enforcement to prevent crime and violence

    ·      Adding over 600 police officers for schools. School r~source officers provide schools
           with on-site security and a direct link to law enforcement agencies. The President will
           announce that the Justice Department COPS Office will release $70 million to fund more
           than 600 police officers in schools in 336 communities across the country. Today's
           announcement is the first installment in meeting the President's pledge made at the White
           House Conference on School Safety to provide funds for up to 2,000 officers in schools.

    ·      Building on the President's successful community policing initiative. In addition to
            helping communities hire school resource officers, the COPS Office is providing $17
           million through a School-Based Partnerships initiative. This initiative emphasizes
           using community policing principles and problem-solving methods to address the
           causes of school-related crime. The grants will help strengthen partnerships
           between local law enforcement and schools, and help them to focus on school crime,
           drug use and discipline problems. Schools have until the end of April to apply for
           these funds.

    Encouraging communities to adopt comprehensive school safety strategies. In addition to
    today's announcements, the President will urge communities to apply for funds through the Safe
    Schools/Healthy Students Initiative, which will provide up to $180 million this year -- and a total



                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
     of $380 million over the next three years -- to help 50 communities develop and implement
     community-wide responses to school safety and youth violence. This initiative, which was also a
     product of the White House School Safety Conference, represents an unprecedented collaboration
     between the Departments of Justice, Education and Health and Human Services to provide
     comprehensive educational, law enforcement, mental health, juvenile justice, and other services to
     help communities prevent youth violence and drug abuse, in and out of school. Communities
     have until June 1, 1999 to apply for as much as $3 million each through this initiative.

     Sending out 150,000 additional guides on the early warning signs of violence. Next week, the
     Departments ofJustice and Education will distribute 150,000 additional copies of Early
     Warning Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools. The guide, aimed at teachers, principals,
     parents, and others who work with young people, provides infonnation on how to identify and
     respond to the early warning signs of troubled youth that can lead to violence in schools. In
     addition, the guide also instructs schools on how to develop a violence prevention plan and
     provides a crisis procedure checklist for schools to use if violence occurs. Finally, the guide
     lists actions students can take -- such as listening to troubled friends, involving trusted adults,
     and asking law enforcement to conduct school safety audits -- to help create safer schools. More
     than 200,000 guides already have been distributed to schools across the nation.
