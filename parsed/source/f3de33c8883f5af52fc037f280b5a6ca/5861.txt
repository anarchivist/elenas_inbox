TEXT:
Last week I told Elena that HHS was planning to post information
summarizing states' TANF Financial Reports for FY 1997 on their web site
yesterday.  We provided comments and suggestions on the document,  then
learned that they've decided to delay release until after they brief
Secretary Shalala on TANF implementation, including this data, on 1/16.
New target data for posting information is 1/19. As of last week, 43
states had submitted data, but HHS now says they've got reports from a few
more.  The delay will allow them to incorporate data from more states and
clarify some issues that should make the data more useful. We'll make sure
we get the updated information and keep you posted.

Elena had asked what we know about the 11 states reporting separate state
programs.  Right now, all we know is the general categories for which they
are reporting expenditures in a separate state program. Of the $111 M
reported by 11 states:
 $55 M is for 'cash and work based assistance' (CO, FL, HI, NY, VA, WI)
 $39 M is for child care (AL, AZ, CO, IA, VA)
$17 M is for 'Other Expenditures' (AZ, CO, FL, IA, ME, RI).
HHS is supposed to be getting more info.  Cash and work based assistance
could reflect spending for immigrants not eligible for federal funds, or
two-parent families.
