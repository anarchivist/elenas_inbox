We need to discuss this. I continue to think that the language represents
a good compromise. Janet is currently meeting with McCaffrey on this
issue. Dan.

Dan -- Thanks for the opportunity to comment on the proposed language --
Have not yet taken this to Barry McCaffrey but but in our view the new
language is contrary to Administration policy.  It would appear to put the
President and BRM out on a limb. Understand that HHS has some concerns,
but have to ask if we really want to reopen this door now? Janet
