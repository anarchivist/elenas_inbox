TEXT:
PRINTER FONT 12 POINT COURIER
Thanks for your comments on the memo to the President.    I will
make the changes you suggest.
As per my rambling voice mail, Carol's comment on the New Mexico
TANF item I included in the draft memo was that she thinks the
President will ask if HHS can take a new look at their
interpretation, and ask if your office agrees with HHS.
I have reprinted below the New Mexico TANF item, but I have just
added the sentence underlined at the end ("Counsel's office is
examining HHS's interpretation.")
Please let me know in the a.m. if that item should be updated to
say that we agree with HHS (or disagree).    I will be running
around till 11 a.m., so beep me or call Jeremy if you have news.
Otherwise this will go in as is.    (It's actually going to Carol
tonight. )
I think the relevant section of the law is Sec. 116 of Title I
 (the last section of that Title) .
New Mexico -- New Mexico is one of the few states that is
disadvantaged by the conversion to a block grant, because its
case load is increasing. The state has said it may have to cut
welfare benefits by 12% to live within the new law.    Senator
Domenici is endeavoring to intercede on the state's behalf with
either a legislative or administrative fix.    He has proposed that
the state get access to the Contingency Fund, but HHS responds
that the state is not eligible until it converts from AFDC to
TANF.   New Mexico has threatened to sue HHS over its position
that the law does not allow the state to draw down more in
Federal funds than the block grant amount in FY1997.    Counsel's
office is examining HHS's interpretation.
