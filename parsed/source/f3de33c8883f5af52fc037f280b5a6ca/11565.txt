TEXT:
You will recall that last month, after a bit of discussion, the SG filed a
petition for cert in Grijalva, seeking review of a Ninth Circuit decision
finding that Medicare HMOs are state actors subject to the Due Process
Clause when they deny coverage to beneficiaries, and asking the Court to
hold the petition pending its decision in Sullivan, an already-argued case
involving similar issues as to the Pennsylvania workers compensation
law.    The SG urged that if the Court found no state action in Sullivan,
it should grant the Grijalva petition, vacate the injunction , and remand
the case to the District Court to reconsider in light of the Sullivan
decision.                                                        As
you may have heard, the Supreme Court on Wednesday decided Sullivan,
holding that the private insurers' action in denying payments to workers
whose claims they rejected, pending appeal, was NOT state action, despite
the fact that they are administering a state-authorized program and the
state had changed the statute to permit the insurers to hold off payment
during the appeals process.   The Court went on to reach the merits of the
due process claim anyway, as to the State of Pa defendants, holding that
the state statutory scheme permitting the suspension of payments during t
he appeal process did not viola'te due process.
         I assume that the plaintiffs in Grijalva, whose opposition to our
petition for cert is due next week, will try to distinguish Sullivan,
e.g .. on the ground that in Medicare the HMOs are operating with Govt
money, but it seems likely that the Court will grant, vacate and remand as
we requested.
         The Court's reaching of the due process issue in Sullivan as to the state
defendants serves as a useful reminder that even if Medicare (or
Medicaid) HMOs are not state actors subject to constitutional constraints
themselves, beneficiaries can still sue the Federal or State agencies for
a judgment that the statutory or regulatory schemes permitting the HMOs to
deny them rights are unconstitutional.
         Let me know if you want a copy of the Sullivan opinion.
