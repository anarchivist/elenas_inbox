TEXT:
Today's crack meeting was primarily a run through of where DOJ and ONDCP
stand on contacting the Hill. Things are going fairly slow so far;
critical meetings/discussions with key Republicans have yet to take
place. Needless to say, we are still without any Republican interest at
this point in time.

An issue arose regarding changes to the 10-year mandatory sentence.   Jose
and I would like to discuss this with you separately.

In addition, the question was raised again as to whether the original
AG/Director letter to the President could be released.   At the last
meeting which DPC hosted, you mentioned that you would check in with
Counsel to see if we could release it. Jose and others are less clear as
to whether we should release it , regardless of whether we are able to.
We should resolve this point soon since there is a CBC event this
Thursday-- DOJ and ONDCP are going to be looking for releasable items to
explain our position in case they are asked.
