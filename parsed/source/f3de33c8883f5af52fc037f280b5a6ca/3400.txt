                  Suspension of Deportation for Central Americans
                                   July 11, 1997

                                   Questions and Answers


Q.     What did the Attorney General announce yesterday regarding Central American
       migrants?

A.      The Attorney General announced the Administration's three-part course of action relating
to a humanitarian form of relief called "suspension of deportation." The 1996 bnmigration Act
severely restricts eligibility for suspension of deportation-- traditionally available to deportable
aliens who have resided in the United States for 7 years, could show good moral character, and
that deportation would cause extreme hardship.

        These actions are aimed primarily at fulfilling the President's promise to ease the harsh
effects of the new law on Central Americans-- many of whom came to the U.S. in the 1980's
fleeing civil wars and political persecution. The three-part course of action is as follows:

       1.      The Attorney General has decided to vacate and take under review a controversial
               administrative decision, Matter ofN-J-B. that made it much more difficult for
               individuals to qualify for suspension. While she reviews the decision, the
               Attorney General has ordered the INS not to deport anyone who would have been
               eligible for suspension but for that decision.

       2.      Next week, the Administration will send a legislative proposal to Congress that
               will provide for a more fair and humane transition to the new, more restrictive
               rules governing suspension. Under the legislation, applicants for suspension who
               were in the administrative pipeline before April I, 1997 will be required to meet
               the standards that applied prior to the effective date ofthe new law. Suspension
               applications filed after April 1 ofthis year will continue to be subject to the tighter
               criteria.

       3.      If Congress is unwilling to pass the proposed legislation, the Administration is
               prepared to consider other available administrative options to protect certain
               Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Nicaraguans who would have qualified for
               suspension but for the new rules.


Q.     Why is the Administration taking this course of action?

A.       As the President learned during his recent trip to Central America, peace and democracy
are still fragile in that region. The sudden return of tens of thousands of Central Americans,
who have been living in the U.S. for many years, could jeopardize these important
accomplishments. The President believes that it is vital to the national security to assist in any
                                                                            Hex.Dump Conversion .
way he can in bringing stability to that part of the world.

       The Administration also recognizes that many of these individuals, after years of being
authorized to remain in the United States, have developed important ties to the country and
should be treated fairly in light of the recently-passed legislation.


Q.     Isn't this basically a huge new amnesty program?

A.      Not at all. The Administration's approach would only ensure that those people with
immigration cases already in the oipeline prior to April 1 are able to benefit from the old
suspension rules in effect prior to that date. Those who apply for suspension will still have to
meet several legal requirements and appear before an immigration judge who has the discretion
to grant or deny the application. Not all individuals who apply for suspension will qualify.


Q.     How many people are affected by these decisions?

A.     The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) estimates that as many as 280,000
people might be eligible to appear before an immigration judge to request suspension. Of this
number, INS estimates that about 160,00 might actually decide to apply for suspension.
However, because suspension is decided on a case-by-case basis, it is extremely difficult to
estimate how many people will be given this remedy under our proposal.


Q.     Isn't the government being sued right now on some of these issues (the Tefel case)?
       What will this mean for cases currently in litigation?

A.      This question would be best answered by the Attorney General. It is our understanding
that the Department of Justice is currently reviewing its posture in these cases in light of this
announcement. The government's position will be made clear in the very near future.


Q.     What has been the response by the Hill?

       We have just begun to notify members of Congress of our proposal. Over the past few
months, we have received requests from over 125 Members and Senators asking us to look at
what we could do administratively or legislatively about this problem. We will continue to work
with them for a just and proper resolution to this matter.
