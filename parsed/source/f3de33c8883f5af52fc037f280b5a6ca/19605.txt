A.      The Education Department will announce later today the
AdministrationO,s opposition to CaliforniaO,s Proposition 227, the Unz
Initiative. This Initiative would virtually end bilingual education and
instead limit students who are not proficient in English to just one year
of O&English immersion08 instruction before they are placed in regular
classrooms. In addition, the Education Department will announce a set of
principles the Administration believes should guide a reform of the way in
which students are helped to become proficient in English.
