     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                 BRUCE REED

     SUBJECT:              Talking Points for Telephone Calls to Senators Lugar & Ford re: Tobacco
                           Bill Fanner Provision


     Current Status
             Senators Lugar and Ford have competing provisions relating to fanners that are each
     included in the tobacco bill. Senator Lugar's measure would end the tobacco program within 3
     years and buy-out farmers at a cost of $18 billion over those three years. Senator Ford's
     measure would continue the tobacco program, giving farmers the option of being bought out. It
     costs $28.5 billion, but the cost is spread over 25 years. Late Tuesday, Senator Ford offered a
     motion to strike the Lugar provision from the bill and that motion is currently pending.

             Senator Ford has previously communicated a possible compromise to Lugar: Ford would
     be willing to end the program in 15 years, offer the states the opportunity to institute state or
     regionally-run programs, scale back the cost of his program to $22.5 billion, and accelerate
     payments to fanners as much is practicable. Senator Lugar said he did not want to accept a
     provision that would continue a production control program, even at a state level, unless there
     was a parallel free market that fanners could choose. This is unacceptable to Senator Ford who
     believes a free market cannot coexist with price controls. Senator McConnell has allied himself
     with Lugar, and has promised Kentucky voters that the $18 billion will be forthcoming in three
     years. The continuation of the program and the speed of the payments are the key issues to
     resolve.

     Talking Points for Call to Senator Lugar

     *      I know that you are deeply concerned about youth smoking and that you want the
            Congress to pass a corr:iprehensive bill that will really do something about this problem.

     *      I also know that you have strong and principled views about the farmers piece of this
            legislation and that you have worked hard on a proposal to protect tobacco farmers, while
            moving toward a free market system.

     *      The problem now is that the fanners issue could hold up the whole bill. I think we need
            to reach a compromise on this issue, so it is not divisive and does not give some senators




                                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
              a way to put the entire bill in jeopardy.

       *      I understand that Senator Ford has suggested a possible compromise -- a proposal to
              tenninate the program over a number of years, while pennitting states to put some pricing
              measures in place ontheir own. I hope you will work with him to come up with a plan
              you both could accept.

       *      If I or Secretary Glickman can be of any help in promoting a compromise approach, we
              would be very glad to do so. We all have a common interest in solving this problem and
              moving the bill forward.


       Talking Points for Call to Senator Ford

       *      I want to thank you for your work in crafting the LEAF Act and in trying to gain
              bipartisan support for the measure.

       *      As you know, I have insisted that any comprehensive tobacco legislation protect tobacco
              fanners and their communities, and I have expressed strong support for your proposal.

       *      I have just talked to Senator Lugar and urged him to move in your direction. We should
              be able to agree on an approach that keeps the federal program going for more than three
              years and allows states to pick up where the federal program leaves off.

       *      I'd like you to work with Lugar to fashion a compromise. I think we can reach a
              compromise that will protect farmers and will be politically acceptable to you. We
              shouldn't let the Republicans use the farmers issue to kill legislation that they don't like
              for other reasons. If Secretary Glickman or I can assist you in any way, you should let us
              know immediately.
