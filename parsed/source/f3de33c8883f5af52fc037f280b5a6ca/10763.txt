Consequences for Low Performance. As we have previously indicated, our overall approach
to accountability requires that individual schools and every school district make continuous
improvement in student achievement. States are required to take immediate steps to intervene in
the lowest performing schools, and your FY 2000 budget includes $200 million to support this
effort. In our plan, corrective action by states, working with the local school district, would first
include extensive teacher training, support to improve school discipline, and implementation of
proven approaches to school reform, such as Reading Recovery, Success for All, or the
designed developed by New American Schools. If these efforts do not lead to improved student
achievement in 2 years, additional corrective actions would be required, including steps to make
wholesale changes in school staff or closing the school and reopen as a charter school. In
addition, the Secretary of Education would have specific authority to withhold the state's'
administrative funds (approximately 1% ofthe state's Title 1 allocation) of if the state fails to
take effective corrective actions at any point in the process. Since state education agencies are
heavily dependent upon federal funds for administrative purposes, this approach involves a
significant financial and public relations consequence to states.

In addition, our Title 1 proposal requires that school districts demonstrate continuous
improvement in student achievement. If a school district fails to accomplish this over a three
year period, states are required to take corrective actions. Ifthe state's intervention fails to lead
to improved student achievement for the school district as a whole, then the Secretary of
Education would have specific authority to withhold half of the school district's administrative
funds under Title 1 (local districts can use 2.5% of their Title 1 funds for administrative
purposes) until the district demonstrates improvement.

In both of the approaches described above, our intent is to fashion a negative consequence that
will be significant for the leadership of state and local school systems, be small enough to be
seen as a credible threat that the Secretary of Education would carry out, and would not withhold
funds that would otherwise go to schools to serve disadvantaged students.
