TEXT:
Tuesday, April 21
statement following Congressional meeting in Oval:

        Time:           12:00 statement
        Location:       Rose Garden steps
        Program:        President, Vice President, Daschle, Gephardt
        Press:          Open
        Audience:       None
        Remarks:        *President - School Modernization, 5 weeks to go,
couple                  of other         important issues left, here
are a couple, and the                            CMB amendment vote
                        *vice President - school Modernization, speaks of
                                 community forums that he held around the
country via conf.                        call, partisan hit on diverting
money vs. investing in future for                        our kids.
                        *Daschle - Lack of Republican agenda, especially
on this,                         we have an education plan, they do not.
                        *Gephardt - after 2 Congressional sessions they
still have                       not done this, indicative of the lack
of focus and                                     unwillingness to make
education a priority/or work hard at it.
                        (Gephardt's office still working this out-will
know more in am)
