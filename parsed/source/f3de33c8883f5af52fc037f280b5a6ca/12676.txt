TEXT:
Just a reminder - please send me your comments on the INS naturalization
roll-out documents Wednesday morning, 5/19.

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, INS plans to brief the Hispanic
Caucus on the INS naturalization plan on Friday, 5/21 and has tentatively
scheduled a briefing unless of course, there are major problems with the
INS naturalization plan.

Thanks.
