TEXT:
We spoke to a couple of staff at the Education Department who have a good
sense of where the hispanic community is on this.

Also, the Department has informed us that Jeffords has asked for the
testimony this afternoon, so we should give them any comments by 3 -- or
3:15 at the latest -- in order for them to be incoprorated before the
testimony gets sent to the hill.  Please page me when you need -- I will
be in a meeting until about 2:45.               -- Jon
