TEXT:
I didn't know about the Conference, but I don't think it's a big deal --
in fact, I think a call from us, encouraging them to down-link the
satellite feed of the WH Conf into some part of their conference would
solve our problems. Do you want me to follow-up directly with Conyers'
office and then the Conference organizers?
