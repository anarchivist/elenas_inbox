TEXT:
Elena,

This morning at the 8:30 mtg you mentioned that you were waiting for
something from Counsel's office -- I thought it was regarding the Child
Support Bill for Wednesday, but I may have misheard.  Rob Weiner didn't
seem to know what was needed. Would you clarify for me what it is that
you need from Counsel?

Thanks,    Peter
