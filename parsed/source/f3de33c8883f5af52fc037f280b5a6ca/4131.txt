          Here is a draft letter from the VP to Harkin stating Administration
          support for Harkin's amendment to fully fund FDA's tobacco enforcement.
          The vote will occur next Wed am. We promised Harkin a letter by
          tomorrow.  The VP's office has asked for DPC clearance of the letter.   I
          have read it and it looks fine.  I also checked with OMB and FDA and they
          have signed off.  Please advise.



          PS I am concerned that although we are much better prepared than last
          time for the vote we are likley to lose again.==================== ATTACHMENT    1

                                                   August xx, 1997

     The Honorable Tom Harkin
     United States Senate
     Washington, D.C. 20510

     Dear Senator Harkin:

     I am writing to inform you of the Administration's strong support for your amendment to fully
     fund the anti-youth access to tobacco initiative in the fiscal year 1998. As you know, every year,
     there are more than $1 billion in illegal sales of tobacco products to children and adolescents in
     the United States. With approximately 500,000 retailers in the country who sell tobacco, it is
     critical that the Food and Drug Administration's request for $34 million in funding be granted in
     order to stop these illegal sales to our children.

     The requested funding is intended to enforce the age and photo ill provisions of the FDA rule,
     upheld by the Federal District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina. The bulk of the $34 million
     will be spent on contracts with states that want to joint FDA in ensuring retailer compliance with
     these provisions. While the FDA is in the process of providing initial funding for 10 states to
     begin conducting compliance checks, the $34 million is needed to allow state officials in all
     interested states to undertake compliance checks in fiscal year 1998.

     The remaining funds are intended to educate retailers and the public about the new rules. We
     believe that the vast majority of retailers in this country will comply with the age and photo ill
     requirements if they understand their responsibilities and recognize the important role they can
     play in protecting children from tobacco and its consequences.

     Funding of the FDA initiative is vital if we are to have a credible national youth tobacco program
     in the upcoming fiscal year; the $4.9 million provided thus far by the Senate will not enable us to
     do so. This amendment has two important elements: first, it requires no additional funding for
     the Agriculture Appropriations bill at issue. In fact, the offset would merely reduce by about
     $30 million in fiscal year 1998, the $1 billion in annual expenditures on USDA's automated data
     processing and information technology equipment and services. The Administration has
     determined that this modest limitation will not impair the ability of USDA to carry out its
     programs and provide services to the public.

     Second, this amendment would sunset government funding for FDA's tobacco program in the
     event that tobacco settlement legislation provides alternative funding from the private sector
     during fiscal year 1998. It is critical that full funding of FDA's youth tobacco initiative begin
     now and not be delayed pending the possible enactment of tobacco settlement legislation.

     Once again, let me assure you that the President and I remain strongly committed to protecting


    young people from tobacco and its consequences. Your amendment would allow the
    government to have in place a meaningful enforcement and outreach program that will ensure the
    safety our children.

                                 Sincerely,
