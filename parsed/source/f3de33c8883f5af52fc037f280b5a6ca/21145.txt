TEXT:
I talked to Becky Blank who thinks the report is less far off than I think
it is.   She thinks the findings support extending FMLA and child care.
She'd like to come in and talk with you about the draft report and how we
might utilize the report.    She'll call your offices to try and set up a
meeting.
