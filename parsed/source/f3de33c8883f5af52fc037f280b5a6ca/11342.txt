TEXT:
The Department of Education is hosting a Charter Schools National
Conference March 15-17 in Denver, CO. Cabinet Affairs submitted a
proposal to the Scheduling Office for POTUS to attend the conference, but
since he will not be traveling that area at that time, the request was
regretted.

However, the President is scheduled to tape videos next week, and John
Schnur and I thought that it might be a good idea to submit this for a
video proposal. Would you be in support of a joint scheduling proposal
(DPC/Cabinet Affairs) to request a POTUS video to be played at this
conference?
