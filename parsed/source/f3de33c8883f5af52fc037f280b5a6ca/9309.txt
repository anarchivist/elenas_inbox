      Julia Carol offered the following interesting observation:

      The federal government has mounted the largest social marketing campaign in
      history to try to curb drug use by kids.  Organized by the White House
      Office
      of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the project includes a paid $200
      million per year advertising and public relations effort (with another $200
      million being contributed by the media in various ways) .

      In an effort to get the campaign off to a quick start, ONDCP
      ?single-sourced?
      the media campaign to Bates Advertising of New York City, an agency which
      had a
      federal government advertising contract (for Joint Military Services
      recruiting) that could be ?piggybacked? onto.  In essence, without a
      competitive review, Bates ~as handed a $150 million account!

      Meanwhile, ONDCP began a ?normal? competitive bid process for the next four
      year phase of the campaign_  A number of firms submitted proposals,
·

    including
    the incumbent, Bates.

    Here?s the rub: Bates handles Brown & Williamson tobacco.    In a BIG way.
    They
    are the creators of the Lucky Strike campaign which is obviously VERY youth
    focused.  They?ve done such a good job on Lucky?s that about a month ago
    they
    were awarded the KOOL and CAPRI accounts, which target African Americans
    and
    young females (worth about $50 million in billings per year) .

    It seems an absolute conflict of interest for an advertising agency that?s
    charged with preventing kids from abusing drugs to be promoting tobacco at
    the
    same time to a so-called ?young adult? target audience, which we all know
    is
    really kids.

    Legally, the government could NOT list tobacco products as a ?conflict? to
    prevent Bates from bidding on the ONDCP account. On the other hand, it is
    stated in the ONDCP plan that they ultimately intend to ?take on? tobacco.
    And
    they chose to give Bates the incumbent advantage by ?single sourcing? them
    the
    original contract.

    What kind of job is Bates likely to do when faced with that task?
    Marketing
    research has shown that the most effective anti-tobacco ads for youth are
    those
    that attack the industry. How likely is Bates the Lucky Strike, KOOL,
    CAPRI
    agency going to be to go after an industry that pays them $50 million a
    year?

    The ONDCP's website is:
    <http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/>http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/

    You can e-mail them from there.

    Please feel free to pass this information along to other concerned citizens
    and/or media.
