         URBAN SCHOOL SYSTEMS ACROSS AMERICA JOIN MOVEMENT FOR
             NATIONAL STANDARDS AND TESTS IN THE BASIC SKILLS

         In a speech to the National Association of Elementary School Principals, President
         Clinton announced today that 13 urban school districts -- with the support of of local
         school boards, superintendents, and teachers organizations -- will participate in voluntary
         national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th grade math that reflect high national standards.
          These tests will be administered for the first time in the Spring of 1999.


 GROWING NATIONWIDE SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL STANDARDS AND TESTS:
 Thirteen urban school systems, including the three largest (New York City, Los Angeles, and
 Chicago) and six of the seven largest, have pledged to participate in the President's voluntary
 national testing initiative. Located in ten states, together, they represent XXX percentage of the
 nation's 4th and 8th graders. The committment of these large school systems demonstrates that
 support for the President's call for national standards and tests is truly nationwide. Students from
 Ft. Lauderdale to Seattle, from New York to Los Angeles, from El Paso to Chicago, will be
 prepared to meet the same basic skills in reading and math, and students, schools and school
 systems can and will be judged against common standards, and on the same measures. For the
 first time, parents, teachers and the public in these communities will know how well students
 perform compared to national standards in reading and math, international benchmarks in math,
 and to students in other cities and states throughout the nation.

  HIGH STANDARDS FOR ALL STUDENTS: With this announcement, urban educators and
  communities send a clear signal that students in inner city schools can and should be held to, and
  measured against, the same challenging standards that are being set for all students throughout
  the nation. Rejecting the notion that students from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot learn to
  the same standards as more advantaged students, these communities recognize that setting high
  standards in the basic skills for all students is a prerequisite for improved teaching and learning.
  Research and experience shows that students can meet high standards, and that low expectations
  lead to low achievement While this step alone will not improve teaching and learning for
  students in urban schools, it will guide and catalyze efforts to strengthen curriculum, provide
. training to teachers, increase parental and community involvement, and support the necessary
  investments at the local, state and national level to improve our schools.

 A CHALLENGE TO EDUCATORS: USE TESTS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND
 ACCOUNTABILITY: President Clinton challenged local educators to use the test information
 to improve teaching and learning and to strengthen accountability. The U.S. Department of
 Education will make available information that describes the knowledge and skills students must
 master in order to meet the national standards. Each year once the tests are given, the test items
 will be released to the public to further clarify what students must know and be able to do to meet
 the standards. Educators should use this information as well as the state or local standards set
 for their students to take steps such as upgrading the curriculum, stengthening teacher preparation
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
and professional development, and promoting parental and community involvement and learning.

The President also challenged educators to use these test to strengthen accountability, by
incorporating the results into school and school district report cards, by reporting the
performance of subgroups of students (such as by race, gender and other background
characteristics), and by providing needed help to low performing students and schools.

A CHALLENGE TO THE NATION: PROVIDE STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS WITH
THE HELP THEY NEED President Clinton challenged the nation to support students in urban
areas and throughout the nation so they can reach high st~dards in the basics, and continue to
learn for a lifetime. He called on the Congress to [whatever we need to say about taxes, and to
enact his proposal to promote early literacy and to recruit and prepare teachers for urban and poor
rural areas.
