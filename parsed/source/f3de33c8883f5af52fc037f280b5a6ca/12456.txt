   TEXT:
   Update - During the Immigration meeting today, we reminded DOJ that we are
   waiting to hear from them on their view of the State Dept. rationale and
   they should be prepared to discuss at the next IWG meeting so we can move
   forward on getting decision on the parity legislation.   Needless to say,
   I don't think we need a separate meeting on this issue at this time.

   I'm happy to pull that group together but frankly, I'm more concerned that
   we get to them on public charge and/or INS naturalization before NACARA
   parity. Which issue do you all think is more urgent.   I'm not sure we
   should load up our meeting too much and discuss all these issues.  Please
   advise.

        Subject: Parity Legislative Proposal- State Dept. rationale

        Scott Busby received a draft of the State Dept. rationale for a broad
        parity legislative proposal. We would like to pull a meeting together of
        the group that has been meeting on this issue that you have convened in
        the past to discuss the State Dept. paper and to prepare a deputy level
        meeting to decide this issue.    Do you want to schedule or would like me
        to schedule the meeting?

        please advise.

        Thanks.
