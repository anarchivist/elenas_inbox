Good morning everyone.
I have run this top ten list past a couple of you - a couple
haven't seen it. This is my best count of the hot issues of the
week - and where I think we are. Can you guys all look at the
list and in particular items with you name and provide us all any
updates if appropriate.
No particular order:
1. SSI Imms - POMS/40 Qs/Refs/etc. - SSA had a key meeting
yesterday to resolve remaining issues. They hope to get their
guidance out Monday. Steve/Diana -- can one of you check in with
SSA to see how yesterday went?
2. SSI Kids - decision - memo in process
3. USDA 18-50s - decision - memo in process
4. Means Tested - as of late Wed, next step was conversation Ken
with Kevin - then possible WH/HHS conf call. Ken/Elena -- any
update?
5. Cost Neutrality - Meeting Friday 11:00
6. Medicaid Waiver - (b)/(d) issue - HCFA mtg Wed eve.   Diana--
are they coming to brief us on which states, etc.
7. Medicaid bucket - Elena -- did you talk further to Anna? To
Cindy? What's next step?
8. Disability Reg - Diana calling meeting Fri/Mon. Is it set?
9. Cuban/Haitians - Further meetings required.   Emily -- what's
new?
10. TANF timing question ($ flowing vs. time limit in effect) --
HHS to look at more closely.   I will talk to Monahan about this
one.
Just making sure we're on top of all these things. please email
to all of us with updates.
Thanks.
