Subject:         Joint Immigration Letter from Senior & Disability Groups

We expect to have a  letter today signed jointly by the key senior and
disability umbrella organizations that will express their concern with
Shaw's immigration proposal.   The letter will be from the Leadership
Council On Aging (representing the 43 national aging organizations) and
the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (120 disability
organization) .

Jack, I hope to have the letter to you by noon for your meeting with Shaw.

Bill (6-7032)
