TEXT:
Here is skeleton for workgroups for your consideration/edit. USDA,
Treasury, DOL all told me after meeting which groups they want to
participate on.  Once we assign chairs, I'll do list of contact
people/agencies for each so they can convene meeting. One of us should
call each chair with that info.  Let me know when you're ready to discuss.
