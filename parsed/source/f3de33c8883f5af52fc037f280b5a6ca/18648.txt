Subject:         Call to Harkin

The VP just spoke to Senator Harkin.  Unfortunately, two minutes before
the VP got back Harkin had called the VP, but he did call right back.   It
was a good call and the VP was totally on message.

Harkin expressed the concerns we expected him to raise and the VP told him
that he wasn't going to endorse Conrad's bill, that he would support
Conrad's bill and any other that included the President's five
principles. He told Harkin that he would participate in an event w/
Harkin and others when they intro their bill. He told Harkin that he
would take his suggestion and say that "whatever passes has to be a good,
strong, bipartisan effort."  (I think we have that language already in his
speech) .

Anyway, that's it.    Thanks Bruce for your help.
