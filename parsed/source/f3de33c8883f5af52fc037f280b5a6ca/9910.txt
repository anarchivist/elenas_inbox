TEXT:
Consumer ratings for public schools: A perfect new Clintonian policy idea
would have four attributes:
        I-it would address a top-ranked voter concern, such as education.
        2-it would conform to the votersD, belief the federal government
should not be creating big new programs but should be providing citizens
with D&tools,D8 especially information, which they can use to improve
their own lives.
        3-it would likely cause open dissention among congressional
Republicans--sparking lots of extremist anti-government rhetoric--but
would also have a good chance of eventually winning sufficient if grudging
Republican support.
        4-it would actually work if we tried it.

        HereD,s an idea with, I believe, all four attributes: Have the
President announce during the SOTU that in order to help parents make more
informed choices about which schools to send their children to, he is
calling on the federal government to collect and disseminate information
about the performance of every k-through-12 public school in the country.
In other words, information that can be used to rate public schools.
        When parents chose a public school for their children, they do so
with little solid information. They go by reputation, SAT scores,
teacher-to-pupil ratios, spending-per-student, and the race and
socio-economic class of the student body.  These are proxies for school
quality. They measure inputs and norms, not actual performance. Though
not wholly unreliable, these measures fail to capture the thing parents
care most about (or should care about): how much improvement of learning
goes on in this school compared to other schools? If my child begins the
year with x level of learning, what are his or her chances of getting to y
by the end of the year in this school compared to other schools? In other
words, what is the D&value addD8 of this school?
    ARMS                                                                           Page 2 of2


             The President could make this rating system happen by requiring
     (with congressional approval) that the Department of Education collect, on
    a nationwide basis, the following three new sets of data :
             I-student achievement tests broken down to the school level.   The
    federal government already has a reliable measuring rod in the National
    Assessment of Educational Progress.    Broader use of the NAEB would be
    expensive and controversial, but it would work.
             2-graduation rates for every high school. Currently each state
    calculates graduation rates differently and the data they gather is
    incomplete.   Federal standards would make the information much more
    reliable and comparable
             3-data tracking student sO, achievements 3-toS years after
    graduation (job, income, further education, etc).
              ItO,s important to note that Washington would merely be providing
    data that would make rating systems possible.    The federal government
    would not be doing the actual rating of schools. That job is better left
    to private organizations, such as newsmagazines and education reform
    groups.   Each of these organizations would be free to weigh the data
    differently and to throw other criteria into the mix, such as SAT scores
    or extracurricular programs. The point is, without the federal government
    providing the above data, no rating system can work (which explains why no
    one has tried to put one together) .
             Choosing a school can be the most important choice a parent will
    ever make for a child.   Such ratings would empower parents to make better,
    more informed choices. More than that, it would be a powerful engine for
    school reform. Numerous experts have noted that the vast majority of
    parents have the Lake Wobegon view that their kidsD, schools are above
    average.   This system might help shake off that complacency. Experts have
    also noted that the mere act of grading institutions causes managers of
    those institutions to make improvements.
             Republicans will probably object that this idea means more federal
    spending and federal intrusion into state and local education matters.    If
    fact, measuring school performance is less intrusive than other policies,
    such as setting high academic standards (and the measurement system can
    probably be done on a voluntary basis).    But just as the standards debate
    highlighted an internal contradiction in conservative ideology (you cannot
    be for local control and high standards), this debate will highlight
    another (you cannot be for parental D&choiceD8 in education but against
    giving parents the information they need to make those choices wisely) .
