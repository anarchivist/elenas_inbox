It would be OK to say something about the new tobacco advertising, which
is designed only to play politics and do anything to keep us from passing
bipartisan legislation to protect kids.

Just make sure it's not too arch or whiny. We don't get any points for
beating up on the tobacco companies -- only by debunking their arguments.
