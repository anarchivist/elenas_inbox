TEXT:
I just faxed to both of you Glickman's proposed testimony on country of
or~g~n labelling for 9 a.m. tomorrow.  Glickman says that he is
"sympathetic to the idea of providing consumers with information about the
country of origin" and then he lays out the pros and cons.   He does not
take a definitive position on the issue, however.
