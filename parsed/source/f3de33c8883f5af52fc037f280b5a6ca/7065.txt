Laura:

Here's this week's news.  It's a bit long, but important and substantive
stuff. Mike: check out the public/private school comparison.   Though
we're not highlighting these points, I thought it was important to include
the raw facts in the President's weekly.  What do you think? jc3

Crime -- This weekend, DOJ's Bureau of Justice Statistics and Education's
National Center for Education Statistics will release a joint report
comparing school crime in 1989 and 1995. The report is based on
interviews with a nationally representative sample of approximately 10,000
students ages 12 to 19. Key findings include:

Little or no change in the overall level of school crime. The overall
level of vict,imization in schools in 1995 was similar to that in 1989
(14.6% versus 14.5%). Violent crimes increased slightly (from 3.4% to
4.2%), and property crimes decreased slightly (from 12.2% to 11.6%).

Drug availability up slightly. The overall availability of drugs
increased slightly (from 63.2% to 65.3%), with marijuana remaining the
most readily available drug -- and 6% more students reporting that it was
easy to obtain (from 30.5% to 36.4%).

Gangs in schools nearly doubled.  The number of students reporting gangs
in their schools increased dramatically (from 15.3% to 28.4%).  Increases
were reported in central cities (from 24.8% to 40.7%), suburbs (from 14%
to 26.3%) and non-metropolitan areas (from 7.8% to 19.9%).

Few students report guns in schools.  In 1995, less than one half of one
percent of students reported taking a gun to school.  However, 5.3%
reported seeing another student with a gun at school, and 12.7% reported
knowing another student who brought a gun to school.

Relationship between gangs, guns, drugs and violence confirmed. In 1995,
similar to 1989, the report found that where students reported the
presence of gangs:


  they were about 3 times more likely to be victims of violent crime (7.5%
versus 2.7%);
- they were more likely to indicate drug availability in their schools
(79.5% versus 61%);
- they were 3 times more likely. to know a student who brought a gun to
school (24.8% versus 7.7%); and
- they were more than 4 times as likely to see another student with a gun
at school (11.9% versus 2.8).

Also, students were about 3 times more likely to be victims of violent
crime if they reported seeing another student with a gun (12.4% versus
3.8%), and more likely to indicate drug availibility if they had been a
victim of violent crime (72.9% versus 65.3).

Gangs, guns, drugs and violence all more likely in public schools.
Specifically, the report found that, as compared to their private school
counterparts, public school students were:

- about twice as likely to report being a victim of violent crime in 1995
(4.4% versus 2.3%), an increase from 1989 when public and private students
were about as likely to be victims of violent crime (3.5% versus 2.9%);

- more likely to report the availability of drugs in their schools (67.2%
versus 48%), about the same as in 1989 (64.8% versus 47.2%).

- more than 4 times as likely to report the presence of gangs in their
schools (30.6% versus 6.8%), a significant increase -- especially for
public schools -- from 1989 (16.4% versus 4.4%); and

- about 3 times as likely to have known or seen another student who
brought a gun to school than were private school students (i3.6% versus
4.4%, and 5.7% versus 2.0%, respectively).
