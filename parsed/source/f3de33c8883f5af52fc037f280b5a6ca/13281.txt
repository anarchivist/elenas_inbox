HEADLINE: Timber Land Bid by Environmental Group May be Rejected

HIGHLIGHT:
The environmental group, Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, put in the highest bid
on a 275-acre tract of burned forest land, but the u.s. Forest Service may
reject it because the group won't sell the burned timber.
BODY:
   BOB EDWARDS, Host: An environmental group has been declared the high bidder
in a federal timber sale in the state of Washington, but the u.S. Forest
Service says it may reject the bid because the group has no intention of
harvesting any of the trees. Jennifer Schmidt [sp) , of member station KPLU,
reports from Seattle.
JENNIFER SCHMIDT, Reporter: In 1994, wild fires swept across the West,
blackening millions of acres of forest land. On the Okanogan National Forest
in Northcentral Washington state, nearly 20,000 acres burned. The Forest
Service is now selling some of that damaged timber as salvage for logging. One
parcel, called the Thunder Timber sale, lies at the heart of a large tract of
undeveloped forest land that provides habitat for Chinook salmon, and one of
the last remaining populations of lynx in the lower 48 states.
MITCH FREEDMAN, Director, Northwest Ecosystem Alliance: The area that we're
talking about is high elevation, continuous beautiful forests.   We see this as
the last bastion of refuge for the rare wildlife that really needs these
places.
JENNIFER SCHMIDT: Mitch Freedman is director of the Northwest Ecosystem
Alliance, a local environmental group.   Freedman contends the 275-acre Thunder
salvage sale violates water quality and other environmental laws. His group
might have sued to stop the sale, but it can't. Last year Congress passed a
law that prohibits most legal challenges of federal salvage timber sales.
MITCH FREEDMAN: We're helpless, so when this sale came across our desk and our
hands were tied, the only thing that I could think to do was to put our money
where our mouth was, and try and buy it.
JENNIFER SCHMIDT: So, at a recent timber auction in Eastern Washington, the
alliance bid higher than two other logging companies, offering $29,000 for the
sale. But, there's still no guarantee it will ultimately win the contract.
Brad Flatten [sp) of the u.S. Forest Service is the head of timber sales for
the Okanogan National Forest. He says the alliance might not get the contract
because it says it won't cut down any of the trees.
BRAD FLATTEN, U.S. Forest Service: We've heard what they've said in the
newspapers and on the radio, and they're saying the same thing to us, and
that's reason for concern on our part. We would not be acting, probably, in
good faith to enter into a contract - this is a contract with the American
people - to cut and remove timber, and we will probably not enter into that
contract unless we have some indication that they really intend to comply with
the provisions of the contract.
JENNIFER SCHMIDT: But the alliance's Mitch Freedman says at least from a
financial standpoint the contract doesn't make much sense.   It costs the
federal government more than $300,000 to auction the tract. Freedman says no
matter who buys it, it's a bad deal for tax payers.
MITCH FREEDMAN: The big question in my mind is why the Forest Service even sees
a need to do this.  The public is still only going to get 10 cents back on the
dollar that we invested. The market is bad. There's no economic value in this
timber, and they're still going to do environmental damage. Why?
JENNIFER SCHMIDT: Forest Service officials say the main objective is ensuring
..    '0'

     the area will provide timber into the future, and the best way to do that, they
     say, is to remove the burned timber now while the wood still has value, and
     replant to speed the growth of new trees.  As for loggers, they see the timber
     as primarily an economic resource. Ron Simon bids on Forest Service tracts for
     Longview Timber, which operates a mill near the sale.
     RON SIMON, Longview Timber: Right now the salvage sales are very important to
     local economies. That wood was meant to provide jobs for manufacturing, for
     the folks that were actually going to do the logging, that type of thing. So,
     the problem with it is, is the economic benefit is not gained by leaving the
     wood out there.
     JENNIFER SCHMIDT: Environmentalists say in some cases, though, the forest is
     more valuable preserved as a place for wildlife and recreation, and
     increasingly they're making their point by going to the marketplace instead of
     court. Over the past decade, environmental groups have bought federal grazing
     allotments, water rights and the permits companies need to discharge
     pollutants. Harvard environmental economist, Rob Staven [sp] , says he thinks
     it would be a mistake for the Forest Service to reject bidders based on how
     they plan to use the land. He says that decision should be made in the
     marketplace.
     ROB STAVEN, Harvard Environmental Economist: I think the important principle is
     that lands do go to their highest valued use, and that some lands within the
     national forests are going to be in their valued use for timber cutting. And
     some lands within those national forests are going to be in their highest
     valued use for recreational purposes. And the flip side of this is that if
     environmentalists want to be able to participate in these markets, that
     environmentalists should recognize, as I think they do, but they certainly
     should recognize that it also means that they're going to lose some of the
     bidding.
     JENNIFER SCHMIDT: Staven says some government regulation of the land is needed,
     but he says federal timber is one resource where free market environmentalism
     can work.  The Forest Service is expected to make a decision on the Thunder
     salvage sale in the next few weeks.  The Northwest Ecosystem Alliance says if
     their bid is rejected, they'll appeal to the u.S. Department of Agriculture.
