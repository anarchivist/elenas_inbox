TEXT:
Elena,

Mike and I both attended the meetings today with Maria re: Puerto 'Rico.
To summarize:  there is a bill going to the house floor on Wednesday that
would authorize the citizens of Puerto Rico to vote on whether they want
statehood, commonwealth status or Independence (the "status choice"
bill). Congressman Soloman has proposed an amendment to this bill that
would: (1) make English the official language of the U.S. as presently
constituted; (2) require all communications between Puerto Rico
(individual and govt.) to the U.S. to be in English; (3) require all
federal activities in P.R. to be in English; and (4) provide that only
English would be used in the public schools. All agree that this language
is worse than that contained in the "English Only" bill that the President
threatened to veto in 1996.

Some on the Hill supporting the Soloman amendment are doing so in order to
kill the plebicite. An alternative to the Soloman amendment is being
drafted ("Soloman lite") that will hopefully give the
pro-English/pro-plebicite folks a place to go (i.e., they can vote 'for
Soloman lite to express their support for English, while not voting for a
pro-English amendment that would kill the bill) .

Tomorrow, the Admin. will issue a SAP that endorses the "status choice"
bill. We will then issue a separate SAP that states that if the President
is presented with a bill that includes the Soloman amendment, he will veto
it. We should be getting a draft of the latter soon.

Julie
