activities?

Let me see if I can clear up some of the misunderstandings on this issue:

        In FY 1999 Congress included in the child survival account the
regular activity of $545 million + $105 million for UNICEF. This is the
$650 million referenced on page 977 of the budget appendix.   The
Administration requests funding for UNICEF in the International Operations
and Programs account, not in the child survival account. On an apples to
apples basis, the Administration is requesting $555 million for child
survival + $101 in UNICEF, for a total of $656 million, slightly above
last year's regular appropriation.

        In addition to the regular child survival appropriation discussed above,
last year there was also an emergency (so designated to avoid budget caps)
one time appropriation of $50 million to the child survival account.
Within this $50 million, Congresswoman Pelosi wanted to use $10 million to
help children with AIDS. The confusion over the direction of AIDS spen
ding comes when you include this funding, as the table below shows:
;.




                             FY 1998 FY 1999 FY 2000
 AIDS reg. prog.             $121 million    $125               $128
 Emergency                                     $10


     Not counting the emergency money, AID will spend $3 million more on AIDS.
     counting the emergency money, AID will spend $7 million less.

         A final point of confusion is that the AIDS level is set by AID,
 not by OMB. We've tried to allow AID a degree of program flexibility
 given numerous Congressional and Administration mandates to satisfy.    The
 AIDS spending level is AID's number, not an OMB-dictated number.    We can
 of course ask AID to spend more, but when you combine the various mandates
 we are levying on AID. (Africa, Asian financial reform, population,
 environment, etc) Brian can in fairness complain about micromanagement.

     Hope this explanation clears things up a bit.     If not, give me a call.
