Brady Report

Q: If the Brady Law has helped to detect and block over 400,000 illegal gun sales, how
many of these persons who tried to buy guns illegally have you prosecuted? The gun lobby
and its supporters say that if you really wanted to strengthen the Brady Law, you would
focus on putting all of these criminals behind bars. What is your response?

A: We do focus on putting gun criminals behind bars. Since the NICS was implemented 6
months ago, the FBI has been actively referring cases to ATF and state and local law
enforcement for further investigation and potential prosecution. Ultimately, we won't take every
case, but we have asked Congress for more funds to hire ATFagents and federal prosecutors to
do the best follow-up possible. I would also note that, prior to the NICS' implementation, Brady
denials were the responsibility of designated state and local law enforcement officials. With the
NICS now up and running, we expect to take more Brady-related cases.

Unfortunately, some of you in the press have been taking the gun lobby at its word, and you
simply have not gotten the full story on this issue. Let's review the facts:

1. The Brady Law has stopped over 400,000 illegal gun sales. By surveying local law
   enforcement officials and tracking the number of gun applications rejected by the FBI, we
   know this to be true. Prior to Brady background checks, guns were bought and sold on the
   honor system.

2. Two-thirds of the illegal gun sales we stop involve persons who have been previously
   convicted or are currently indicted for a felony crime. The remaining third involve domestic
   violence misdemeanors and restraining orders, drug addicts, mental deficients, and other
   prohibitions in state and federal law. Although some of these persons may not be serious
   criminals - or may have committed their crimes many years ago and are no longer a threat to
   public safety - it is very reasonable to assume that, by stopping them from buying a gun, we
   have prevented gun crimes and violence.

3. Gun crimes are down by virtually every measure. FBI crime statistics confirm that, since
   1993, gun-related crime is down by more than 25 percent. The overall number of violent
   crimes is down, and so too is the percentage of violent crimes committed with guns.

4. The number of gun criminals doing time in state and federal prisons is up by 25 percent since
   1992 (from 20,681 to 25,186), and the number of serious gun criminals (those serving
   sentences of 5 or more years) in federal prison is up by nearly 30 percent. This is because we
   work more closely with state and local law enforcement - who investigate and prosecute
   most gun crimes - to vigorously enforce gun laws.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

5. This Administration has increased funding for state and local law enforcement by more than
   500 percent, helped local law enforcement trace a record number of crime guns, proposed
   increased funds for new ATF agents and federal prosecutors, and more. We need these
   resources to investigate and prosecute more gun cases. Unfortunately, the gun lobby and
   critics of our enforcement record have not backed up their tough talk with resources.


Q: Have all 400,000 of these attempted gun purchases been referred to law enforcement
for further investigation?

A:      The FBI refers all persons who are denied guns to the ATF. The ATF then screens these
potential cases, and sends a portion of those cases to appropriate ATF field offices for further
investigation. At the field level, ATF works with their local U.S. Attorney's office to determine
which potential cases warrant the additional investment of federal resources and prosecution.
Federal prosecutors and ATF attempt to target the most serious and dangerous offenders for
prosecution.



Q:    The report states that 312,000 sales were stopped through background checks
through 11/29/98. How did you arrive at the 400,000 total?

A:      While the report only contains information during the interim Brady period, today, the
Justice Department released additional, up-to-date information on background checks since the
NICS took effect in late November. The FBI keeps current information on the number of
background checks conducted by the NICS and by state points of contact. Thus, the 400,000
total includes an additional 90,000 gun sales that have been blocked in the first 6 months of the
NICS.

         During this six month period, over 4.1 million background checks were conducted -
about half by the FBI (2 million), and the other half by the states (2.1 million). The FBI confirms
that it has denied over 42,000 applications for gun sales of the total number of checks it
conducted, and estimates that state points-of-contact have denied another 48,000 applications for
gun sales.


Q:     The 400,000 gun sales stopped is based on an estimate that States have denied about
48,000 applications for gun sales since the National Instant Check System took effect.
What did you base the 48,000 figure on?

A: The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) based the 48,000 figure on two key pieces of
information. First, the FBI can confirm that states conducted about 2.1 million background
checks in the first six months of NICS. BJS then applied the average denial rate during the entire




    interim Brady period (2.4 percent) to the total number of state checks conducted (2.1 million)-
    which comes to an estimated total of 48,000 gun sales denied.


    Q: The report contains some state breakout data on the number of gun sales denied. Why
    is there so much variance between states in their denial rates?

    A: There are a number of factors that can impact state denial rates. For instance, states may have
    in place additional laws to disqualify individuals from buying guns that exceed federal law. For
    instance, some states may prohibit gun sales to individuals based on arrests alone, without
    requiring a conviction. In addition, law enforcement access to, and computerization of records
    on critical information which impacts gun eligibility (e.g., mental illness, domestic violence
    misdemeanors) can have a significant impact on denial rates.


    Misc. Gun

    Q:     Yesterday, the Vice President said that youths between the ages of 18 to 20 years-old
    could go into gun stores, pawn shops and gun shows and legally buy a handgun. Isn't this
    wrong?

    A:     As the Vice President's office clarified yesterday, currently, 18 to 20 year olds can legally
    buy handguns from gun shows, friends, neighbors, private collectors and other unlicensed sellers.
    However, they may not legally purchase handguns from federally-licensed gun shops and
    pawnshops. This is already prohibited under current law.

            More importantly, however, current law allows 18 to 20 year-olds to possess handguns
    regardless of where they obtained them. The Vice President strongly believes that we should
    close this loophole by making it illegal for 18 to 20 year-olds to generally possess handguns. The
    Justice-Treasury report the Vice President released yesterday on the disproportionate amount of
    gun crime committed by 18 to 20 year -aIds confirms the importance of passing into law the
    Administration's proposal to ban transfer to and possession of handguns by this age group.
