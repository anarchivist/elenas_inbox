                       Statement by the President on Release of Consumer Product Safety
                                  Commission Report on Phthalates in Toys
                                               December 2, 1998


                  I congratulate Chainnan Ann Brown and the Consumer Product Safety Commission on
          the release of a comprehensive and thoughtful report examining the potential exposure and health
          risks to children from teethers, pacifiers, rattles and toys containing chemicals called phthalates
          that are used to soften plastic. The report makes clear that the best scientific evidence shows
          that children are not at risk ofhannful exposure to these chemicals. It also provides
          infonnation to consumers about the safety of products that may contain phthalates, and outlines
          the Commission's plans for further study. I also commend the many manufacturers and retailers
          who are taking the additional, precautionary step of discontinuing the sale of products designed
          for children to put in their mouths that contain the phthalate DINP. This should allay any
          remaining fears that families have about these products.

                 The CPSC report and supporting measures by manufacturers and retailers will go a long
          way toward calming concerns about the safety of products used everyday by our nation's
          youngest children. This report also commits the Consumer Product Safety Commission to
          pursue additional rigorous work in this area. The Administration will support both the
          Commission's continued efforts to investigate any risks to children from phthalates, as well as
          govemment and private efforts both here and abroad to take appropriate precautionary measures.
