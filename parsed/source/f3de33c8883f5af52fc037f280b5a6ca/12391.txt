      TEXT:
      I thought you should be aware of this complaint that came into the WH
      comment line.   I'm not sure if we need/should do anything about it ... maybe
      someone on the DPC staff or Scheduling staff could call her ... we can
      always send a letter, but I'm not sure what it would say.   Let me know
      what you think.

      as discussed.  let me know if there is anything else we should do.  i'm a
      bit reluctant to give out a means for special treatment, especially if
      this woman plans to publish it in her letter. thanks.
