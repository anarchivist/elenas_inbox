TEXT:
Elena,

Justice agreed to your word change in the first paragraph of the section
in dispute.  Education and Justice objected to taking out the second
paragraph, however, because of the need for clarity regarding the correct
legal standards that apply, as explained in the footnote, which you did
not receive on the last version.  It is copied below.  To address your
concerns, though, Chuck suggested that we take out the language suggesting
that the court "correctly held that a recipient can use a cutoff score .
     and instead simply state that the court "applied" the legal standards
and then cite to this footnote.  I hope that this compromise works for
everyone.

        1/ The district court mentioned, but did not apply to Title VI,
the 1991 amendments to Title VII that require a defendant to bear both a
burden of production and persuasion on its business necessity
justification.   37 F. Supp. 2d at 697.  See 42 U.S.C. 2000e(m),
2000e-2k(l) (A). Although the alleged discrimination in this case occurred
after 1991, the court appears to have applied the previous standard, set
out in wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989), that the
defendant bears only a burden of producing evidence that the challenged
employment practice has a legitimate business justification.   If this
Court agrees with the district courtO,s ruling that the NCAA failed to meet
its burden under Wards Cove because it O&has not produced any evidence
demonstrating that the cutoff score used in Proposition 16 serves, in a
significant way, the goal of raising student-athlete graduation ratesOB (37
F. Supp. at 712), it will be unnecessary for the Court to determine
whether the district court erred in failing to require the NCAA to satisfy
the heavier burden imposed by the civil Rights Act of 1991. Cf. Elston v.
Talladega County Bd. of Educ., 997 F.2d 1394, 1407 n.14 (11th Cir. 1993).
In any event, this Court should not resolve this important issue without
the benefit of full briefing from the parties (see NCAA Br. at 47 n.19,
Cureton Br. at 36 n.19).
