SUBJECT:       Long-Term Strategy Memorandums

       Thank you for the initial survey of important issues in your area and their current status.

         We would like you to build upon what you have given us and construct a strategic plan
for the next six months for each of the major policy areas within your Council. The purpose of
the strategic plan is, for each major issue area, to describe our goals, our best vehicles and
initiatives, the optimal timing and legislative/political context for advancing our initiatives, what
opposition we will face, and how we will overcome that opposition. What follows is:

       A.      A list of the major policy areas and designated Council(s) to take the lead in
               drafting the strategic plan;

       B.      A schedule for your reference of the four major time periods over the next six
               months;

       C.      Formats for two submissions: (1) issue-oriented strategic plans in the major policy
               areas of your councils and (2) a list of significant upcoming challenges that will
               require Administration responses;

       D.     Executive actions or other non-legislative actions the President can take
       regarding policy initiatives within or outside of the major policy areas.

       Thank you for your hard work on this project, we are confident that it will result in an
excellent tool for constructing a successful strategy for the next six months.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion     .


A.     Thematic Topics and Lead Policy Councils

       A.      Social SecuritylMedicare -- NECIDPC

       B.      EconomylBudgetiTaxes -- NEC

       C.      Crime -- DPC

       D.      Education -- DPCINEC

       E.      Environment -- CEQ

       F.      Health -- DPC

       G.      Strong America -- NSC

       H.      Other Priorities (initiatives that do not logically fit in the above areas but you feel
               are important).

B.     Time Periods and Issue Context.

       For your reference, we have broken down the next six months into four major time
periods, each of which has had its own distinct thematic rhythm in the past.

               I.     March thru April 4 (Easter)

               II. April 4 to May 31 (Memorial Day)

               ill. June 1 to July 4th (recess)

               IV. July 4th thru August (recess)

C.     Suggested Formats for Submission

       (1).         Format for Strategic Plans

       [The goal of the plans is to concisely layout what we want to accomplish, what
opposition we will face, the context of our challenge, how we will acJ1ieve our goals, and an
explanation of the best timetable for our actions.]
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       The plans should be fonnatted in the following manner:

I. General Policy Area (Crime)

       (General goals for the issue area including brief description of what we have
       accomplished and what we seek to accomplish over the next 6 months).

       A. Specific Agenda Item, such as the Crime Bill. Please limit plans to only major
       agenda items. Describe proposal very briefly (e.g. legislation to add an additional
       100,000 police officers and ... ).

       B.   Pos~iblePresidential Actions (announcements, Executive Orders,
                studies, events.)

       C. Republican agenda and likely response.

       D. Timing and Strategy. Describe when we should act and why. Include important
       deadlines or events for the initiative. In considering the timing please describe legislative
       status (hearing or markups in the next six months), consider the general political context,
       indicate significant related events (e.g., the ending of the school year for an education
       roll-out, a significant anniversary), and concisely explain how the strategy will enable us
       to achieve our goal. In laying out your plan, please consider how your plan will build over
       time or indicate the series of steps that you want to take to reach a successful conclusion.

       (2) Format for Submissions for Challenges that Require Administration Response

        [As we discussed in our meeting this week, we expect a number of significant issues will
present challenges to the administration between now and August. Some of the ones we
discussed are: Military Readiness; NATO; The G8 ,including financial architecture; Tongas
Management Plan; The Census; Israel; ChinaIMFN; Renewal of the Haze Rule and Ireland. We
ask that you review your list of challenges (which may include some of the ones listed above)
and within the suggested fonnat set out below, develop a strategy for an appropriate response.]
In your submission, please:

                I.     Indicate the topic of the challenge and briefly describe it.

                          A.   Timing. Explain when the issue is likely to come to the forefront
                          and why.

                          B.    Responses. Describe what the Administration response should be
                          and what preparation is required to be ready for an appropriate response.

                     C. Presidential Action. Indicate whether a Presidential action will be
                     required, what it is likely to be (statement, etc), and its probable timing.
D_     List of Executive of Actions
                                                                               ~N)ump ComrelSlOn



        Anticipating that the Congress may not be in a position to enact legislation, we also ask
that you outline possible unilateral Presidential announcements or executive orders, including
those that may fall outside the scope of major policy areas. Also, include the dates when you
believe the administrative action can be taken. Our objective is to have a set of administrative
announcements that are prepared or will be prepared for a date certain. Please list the action, the
background, the date when it will be ready and when (optimally) used, an assessment of its
priority, and any reasons it should not be used.

       If you have any questions, contact Karen Tramontano at x61987. Please submit paper to
her by COB Tuesday.
