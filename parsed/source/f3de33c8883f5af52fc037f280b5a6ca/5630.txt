                               ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION #1
                                Fairfax, A Microcosm of Change:
        What can we learn from the growing diversify in the Fairfax County Public Schools?

Goal:           Begin to follow up on the President's interest in Fairf~ County... Talk to people in one of
                the most diverse school districts in the nation to help us learn about the road which led
                them to where they are today and to help chart the nation's course toward One America.

Format:         Moderated question and answer. Time for Q&A from the audience and Advisory Board.

Moderator:      Local Faiifax TV personality or First Lady

Participants:   Fatema Kohistani, Senior, Annandale High School
                Parentfrom a Fairfax County public school
                Chris Yi, Teacher, Holmes Middle School
                Carol Franz, Principal, Bailey's Elementary School
                Cindy Hook, Teacher, Annandale High School (Teacher who's been in school system for
                30 years as both a student and teacher)

Possible Questions:
1. What did Fairfax County's citizens look like 30 years ago? Paint us a picture of how Fairfax
   has changed and how Fairfax schools have changed? (Hook)

2. How do you teach in an environment with 36 languages? What special skills does it require
   and how were you prepared to manage the diverse classrooms like the ones you have at
   Annandale High School? (Teacher Yi)

3. Moving from the classroom level to the school level, how does a school deal with such a
   diverse student body? What are some of the strategies you have had to put in place to ensure
   success for all students? (Principal Franz)

4. Ms. Franz highlighted parental involvement as a key strategy of success in her school, do you
   think parental involvement is important? How has it improved the educational environment
   for your children? (Parent)

5. Ms. Franz, your school underwent dramatic demographic changes over the past two decades,
   but not without a fight from many (mostly white) parents. You have a very deliberate policy
   of mixing students of different abilities and backgrounds. How have you been able to
   assuage the fears of parents that their children can learn in an environment where their
   classmates are still learning English?

6. What are the benefits ofliving, working and going to school in a place as diverse as
   Fairfax? (to all)

7. What is the social environment for students like at Annandale High School? Do students of
   different groups interact or do they sit separately in the cafeteria?

8. Ms. Franz, the schools districy spent $3 million in 1991 to improve Bailey's and tum it into a

                                                    1
                                                                           Hex·Dump Conversion

   magnet school, are there lessons to learn from Bailey's that don't cost $3 million?

9. Is diversity a benefit in and of itself or must a school have programs in place to capitalize on
   this asset?




                                      LUNCH ROUNDTABLES


Goal:            To hear additional voices of students, parents and teachers from Annandale High School
                 in a more intimate setting.

Format:          Advisory Board members break up into groups of two and meet with Annandale High
                 School students, parents, and teachers. Discussion is kicked off with viewing ofPSA.
                 Open press.

Possible Questions:

             1. Do you think what the young people said in this PSA is true?

             2. Has your experience in this school or in your community taught you that you're
                "really not that different" as the PSA says?

             3. Have you ever experienced racism?

             4. Do students of different groups interact or do they stick to their groups? What do
                students in this school think about interracial dating?

             5. What would you like the President to know or do to improve race relations in
                America?

                                 ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION #2
             Experiences and Challenges Associated with Race in Public Education

Goal:            To answer the question: is there equal opportunity in American schools?

Format:          Moderated question and answer (no opening remarks from participants.) Time for
                 question and answer from the audience and from the Advisory Board.

Moderator:       Judy Winston

Participants:    William J. Bennett, Director, Empower America, and Former Secretary, U.S. Department
                 of Education
                 James Comer, renowned education reformer and Professor of Child Psychiatry, Yale
                 University
                 Jonathan Kozol, Author, Savage Inequalities
                 Waldemar ("Bill") Rojas, Superintendent, San Francisco Public Schools, and Chair,
                 Council of Great City Schools

Possible Questions:
1. Why does race matter in education?

2.   Is there equal opportunity in America's schools? Yes or no? If yes, what's the evidence? !fno,
     what are the consequences of failure to provide equal opportunity?

3.   Are there different resources available to minority children and white children? Paint us a
     picture through your experiences.
       · Are there differences between teachers who teach minority kids and teachers who teach
          white kids?
       · Are there differences in the courses they take?
       · Are there differences in facilities and other resources such as computers?

4.   Do resources matter for learning and for future success? Some school districts that spend the
     most money per pupil still have the worst test scores so how can you say that resources matter?

5.   Can school funding problems and inequitable resources be solved through vouchers which
     give students an opportunity to select the school they attend? Can charter schools address
     these issues?

6.   At the President's town meeting recently, an African American student said that a guidance
     counselor discouraged him from taking the toughest courses. Do we have different
     expectations for our children based on race? Is this a more subtle form of racism?

7.   Why do African American and Hispanic children continue to score below average in tests of reading
     and math?

8.   Why, despite closing the gap between black and white dropout rates,      are Latino and Native
     American children continuing to drop out at alarming rates?

                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
9.    This morning we were celebrating the diversity of Fairfax schools, yet many of our inner city
      schools are increasingly racially isolated. Is this a problem?

10. What are the benefits of diversity in schools? Should we do something about the increasing
    self-segregation within our schools?

                                     ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION #3
                                     Promising Practices and Strategies

Goal:             To illuminate some promising approaches for addressing the various challenges that have been
                  raised throughout the day

Format:           Moderated question and answer (no opening remarks from participants.) Time for question
                  and answer from the audience and from the Advisory Board.

Moderator:        Judy Winston

Participants:     Diana Lam, Superintendent, San Antonio Public Schools
                  Robert Moses, The Algebra Project
                  Deborah Meier, Principal, Mission Hill Charter School
                  Gary Orfield, Professor of Education, Harvard University
                  Conservative TBA

Possible Questions:

1. We have heard all day about the challenges our schools face ... how do we reduce disparities that
   continue to exist among races?

2. Dr. Moses, tell us about the Algebra project. What are the keys to its success?

3. Why do expectations matter?

4. Ms. Meier, you founded Central Park East Secondary School, a school with a track record of
   success serving children of color, what does it take to make a school successful for all children?

5. Across the country we see that children of color are disproportionately tracked into special
   education and lower level courses. How does this happen? How do we ensure that we are
   challenging all students?

6. Does the way we teach children of color differ? Should it?

7. In our earlier panel, we heard a Fairfax principal talk about the challenges ofteaching classes with
   students of many different language backgrounds. Is bilingual education the right way to help
   these children learn? Why or why not?

8.   Some parents want to send their kids to neighborhood schools. Do we still need desegregation? Why is
     segregation bad? Does it prevent us from serving the needs of all children?

    9. Can charter schools make a difference in serving the needs of all children?
