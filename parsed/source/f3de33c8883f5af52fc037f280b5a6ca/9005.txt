TEXT:
Elena, Bruce and Gene--I am forwarding this to you to underscore
Edley'sfrustration and ask for assistance.  I just had a very good
conversation with Elena in which I relayed the gist of the conversation
with Gene yesterday--I made very clear to Gene and to Christopher that we
needed to accomplish two things in this book project:  1) we must respect
the process needs of the policy councils to ensure that ideas presented to
the President have in fact been considered and opined by all necessary and
appropriate parties and, just as importantly, 2) we must respond to the
President's desire that this book on race have some bold policy thinking
and that can only happen if the policy councils are engaged in this
process in a wholehearted way.  Now Gene said he would task his staff to
work with Christopher, while Gene's away.  Elena has indicated that she's
discussed with you Bruce how hard this is going to be but that DPC has to
be fully engaged to ensure that the President really has the benefit of
the diversity of opinions of his staff.            .

I suggested to Elena that the ambitious nature of this project requires
some brainstorming and then some triage of ideas, otherwise there is
simply too much on the plate. A suggestion I had that I give to all of
you for consideration is that in each of the four areas:  education,
economic opportunity, criminal justice, civil rights , you should within
two-three weeks identify the three/four big ideas that could then be
developed through intensive policy process by end of September--keeping in
mind that at the same time the policy councils will be working on
budget/sotu and therefore, these ideas could be factored into that process
as well. Thus, for example, you could, after some brainstorming, decide
that in education the President should consider saying something about
opportunity to learn standards, the advisability of continued efforts to
integrate schools, school financing--and then engaged in intensive work
that would present pros and cons for President's consideration.

At any rate--I ask that you work with me to try to achieve both of these
goals--sooo, in that context, why does Christopher have to wait until
Michael Smith comes back from vacation--wouldn't a meeting this week to
set the universe of ideas and get some thinking about how to explore some
of these ideas be useful--Michael Smith as well as other key folks will
