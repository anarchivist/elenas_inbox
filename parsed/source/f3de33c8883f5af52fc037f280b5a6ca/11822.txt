TEXT:
I was just at an impromptu meeting about the Nursing Home bill. There was
a general consensus that people want to get at least a small signing with
members only on the schedule next week. However, if there is some policy
to announce they were interested in doing a slightly larger event on
Tuesday or Wednesday.  I was asked to get back to the
Communications/Press/Leg. Affairs group by the end of the day today to let
them know what the prospects are.  Please let me know what, if anything,
we think we could do early next week.

Thanks!
