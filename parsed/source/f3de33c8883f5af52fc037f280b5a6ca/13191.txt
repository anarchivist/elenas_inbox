    TEXT:
    We have received many calls about the Federal Government's
    potential shutdown beginning Tuesday, November 14.  In that
    regard, please pass along the following message to the staff in
    your offices:
    Please DO NOT PANIC! We will be operating BUSINESS AS USUAL, and
    will continue to operate in the hopes that we will not shutdown.
    Please report to work on Monday as usual.  However, on Monday, if
    shutdown is imminent, all personnel will be notified of this
    status.
    If your position is deemed as "Emergency personnel", you will be
    informed in writing that you must report to work on Tuesday
    morning.
    If you plan to take leave on Monday due to the holiday weekend,
    please report to work on Tuesday regardless of the shutdown
    status.
