      This may be a little much-- its a brief description of the bills.   I
      included some of the material from the weekly item (the lawyer fee bills
      part) I  sent on 10/31, I'm not sure if it got in before. Also, I don't
      mention the Graham (D-FL) bill to prohibit HHS from treating Medicaid
      related funds, recovered as part of state litigation from the tobacco
      companies, as overpayments under the Medicaid program.    ==================== ATTACH

     Legislation in Congress on Tobacco
             In response to your announcement of a plan for tobacco legislation and the subsequent
     meeting with bipartisan Congressional leaders, a number of bills have been introduced in the last
     few weeks. Senator Hatch has introduced legislation that increases the cost of the proposed
     settlement from $368 billion to $397.5 billion, raises the limits on company payments if
     underage smoking fails to reach target levels, but differs with public health groups on FDA
     authority by not treating cigarettes as "drug delivery devices." The bill bans future class-action
     suits against the companies and provides punitive damage protection for past misconduct.
     Senator Kennedy's bill raises the cost of the settlement to more than $600 billion, increases the
     tobacco tax by $1.50 over three years, and fails to provide tobacco producers with protections
     against lawsuits. Senator McCain has introduced a bill that is directly patterned on the
     settlement language itself. Senator Lautenberg has introduced a bill that would cost $494 billion
     and give cigarette makers no relief from lawsuits.
             In addition to these comprehesive tobacco bills, more specific bills involving the
     settlement have also been introduced. Several House members have legislation to limit fees
     paid to attorneys involved in the settlement. Senators Ford and Lugar have bills that differ from
     each other regarding the maintenance of the price support system for farmers and the buying out
     of farmers' quotas. Also this week, Speaker Gingrich said the House may break the national
     tobacco settlement into separate bills, such as teenage smoking and industry liability, and act on
     each as a consensus emerges. Finally, Congressman Bliley held the first in a series of hearings
     this week during which he publicly pressed the tobacco industry for the release of 864 documents
     that are at issue in a lawsuit filed by the State of Minnesota.
