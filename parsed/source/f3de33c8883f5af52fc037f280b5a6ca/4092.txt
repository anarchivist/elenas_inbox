Agencies to Release Information on Legal Immigrants' Access to Federal Programs -- Last year's
welfare reform law says that legal immigrants who arrive after August 1996 may not get "federal
means tested benefits." During last year's debate, the Republicans tried to include a broad
definition of this term into the new law, which would have placed a large number of federal
programs out of the reach of these newly arriving legal immigrants. However, that definition
was struck under the Byrd Rule, leaving the Administration to define it.

Federal agencies have worked together and with the Department of Justice to develop a common
definition of "means tested benefits." Tomorrow, HHS and SSA will publish the
Administration's interpretation that no discretionary spending programs fall into this category.
This means that only a few programs are off-limits to newly arriving legal immigrants -- SSI,
food stamps, TANF, Medicaid, and the new child health program. HHS and DOJ have already
advised Rep. Lamar Smith of this interpretation, and in a letter to the Attorney General he
strongly criticized the Office of Legal Counsel's opinion that the definition is legally permissible.
 In the past, Smith has threatened to try again to enact into law his preferred, broader definition.
Immigration advocates and state and local governments will be very pleased with our action.
