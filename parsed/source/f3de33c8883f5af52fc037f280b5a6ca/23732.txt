I guess I should keep up to the minute with my e-mail but I just found
this. To be honest, there's no way it should have been this late if we
were serious about it. And second, she needs to know that she should let
us know when a final statement is headed in our direction. We'll put it
out but it will be pro forma at this time of day.

Bruce Reed has reviewed this statement:

Today, Achieve Inc, an education reform group comprised of governors and
corporate leaders, announced the formation of a math partnership to help
students in this country perform as well in mathematics as their peers in
other countries.  I applaud the news of this partnership between states,
governors, business, educators and others to help improve middle school
math and help students reach world class standards. The Third
International Math and Science Study (TIMMS) showed us that while the
performance of our 4th graders ranked near the top, by eighth grade our
students are only performing at the international average. We must do
everything we can to help our children master the basics. This effort by
Achieve will respond to the TIMMS results and help our students to meet
world class standards.   I welcome this effort by Achieve to improve their
curriculula, strengthen teacher training and provide tools to measure
whether kids are meeting world class standards.
