               MORE JOBS, HIGHER WAGES, AND LOW INFLATION
         AMERICA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW STEADY AND STRONG
                                                            February 6,1998

     TODAY, THE LABOR DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE ECONOMY CREATED
     358,000 NEW JOBS LAST MONTH, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE REMAINED AT A
     24-YEAR LOW, AND WAGES CONTINUED TO RISE. The economy as strong as its been in a
     generation. It is clear that President Clinton's three-part economic strategy -- reducing the deficit,
     investing in our people, and tearing down foreign barriers to American goods -- is working for
     America's working families.

     ·      1.1 MILLION NEW JOBS IN PAST 3 MONTHS -- MORE THAN 14.7 MILLION NEW JOBS
            UNDER PRESIDENT CLINTON. In the past three months, the economy added 1.1 million
            new jobs -- 358,000 new jobs last month alone. During the Clinton Administration, the
            economy has added 14.7 million new jobs -- a faster annual rate of job growth (2.6 percent per
            year) than any Republican Administration since the Roaring 1920s. The economy has added 3.3
            million jobs over the past year. [Source: Based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics survey.]
     ·      STRONG PRIVATE-SECTOR JOB GROWTH. Last month, the economy added 349,000
            private-sector jobs. Since President Clinton took office, the private sector of the economy has added
            13.7 million new jobs -- with 3.0 million jobs added in the past year. Under President Clinton, 93
            percent of the 14.7 million new jobs under President Clinton have been in the private sector -- that's a
            higher percentage than any Administration since President Warren G. Harding. [Source: Based on data from
            BLS.]


     ·      REAL WAGES RISING AGAIN. After stagnating or declining for years, real wages are rising
            again. Over the past 12 months, wages have risen 3.8 percent -- that's twice as fast as the rate of
            inflation. [Source: BLS]

     ·      UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINED 4.7 PERCENT -- ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN 25 YEARS. The
            January unemployment rate was 4.7 -- its lowest level since 1973. The unemployment rate has
            been below 6 for 41 consecutive months and at or below 5 for 10 months now with no signs of
            inflationary pressures. In 1992, the unemployment rate was 7.5 . [Source: BLS.]

     ·      TURNING THE CORNER IN BASIC AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. Under President Clinton,
            basic American industries, such as construction and autos, are coming back and leading the world.

            o       1.3 Million New ConstrUction Jobs. After losing 667,000 jobs in construction during the previous four
                    years, more than 1.3 million new construction jobs have been added since January 1993 -- that's a faster
