TEXT:
Update: DOT is planning to release the fatality data at the MADD event in
Kentucky tomorrow morning.  The event ~ommemorates the lOth anniversary of
the worst drunk driving crash in the nation's history.  MADD got wind of
the fatality data, and started to push hard on DOT to release for the
event. Aside from the fact that no one wants to anger the President of
MADD (whose daughter died in this crash), DOT was hoping to get the data
out this week.   DOT reps and MADD will be pushing the .08 message at the
event.
