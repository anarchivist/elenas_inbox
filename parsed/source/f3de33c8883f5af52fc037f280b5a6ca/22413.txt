       Fund To Help Tobacco Farmers

       By ESTES THOMPSON
       Associated Press writer

       DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's four largest cigarette companies agreed
       today to set up a
       $5.15 billion trust fund to help tobacco growers who face a shrinking
       market due to settlements of
       lawsuits that have sharply raised the price of smoking and stepped up
       anti-smoking initiatives.

       The agreement climaxed two days of private meetings between company
       officials and representatives
       from 11 tobacco states. For a time, it appeared the trust fund was in
       jeopardy because R.J.
       Reynolds balked at participating. The company said a better way to help
       the farmers would be to
       buy more of their tobacco.

       But during negotiations today, R.J. Reynolds relented and signed onto the
       trust fund, which was
       restructured. Previously, the four companies -- R.J. Reynolds, Philip
       Morris, Brown & Williamson
       and Lorillard -- would have paid into the fund over 10 years; the
       agreement extends that to 12 years.

       "There are many, many details yet to be worked out,"   said Phil Carlton,
       the lawyer representing the
       tobacco companies. "One of the concerns was one of the companies in
       particular had a problem
       with paying the money out that would have been its share in the first
       couple of years.' ,

       Tobacco farmers have been worried about their future as the drive against
       smoking intensified,



     Costly settlements of state claims against tobacco companies seeking
     reimbursement for the cost of
     treating sick smokers have sharply raised the price of cigarettes and that
     is expected to reduce
     demand.

     The trust fund initially was proposed by Philip Morris after the major
     cigarette makers agreed to a
     $206 billion settlement with 46 states over health care costs last
     November. Part of that agreement
     required the companies to meet with state officials to discuss the trust
     fund for farmers.

     Philip Morris announced last week it would deposit $300 million into the
     fund this year, even if other
     companies chose not to participate. But the No. 1 tobacco company said its
     future participation
     hinged on the other companies joining the fund.

     During the fund's first year, the companies would put in $380 million,
     with Philip Morris' $300 million
     contribution making up the bulk of the payment.

     The second year, the companies would deposit $280 million; the third year,
     $400 million; years
     four-10, $500 million a year; the 11th year, $440 million; and the 12th
     year, $150 million, the
     officials said.

     North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said each state will receive a share of the
     fund equal to the amount of
     tobacco it grows.

     States participating in the discussions are North Carolina, Ohio, South
     Carolina, Tennessee,
     Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, virginia and west Virginia.

     Hunt said the directors of the trust will determine the amount of the
     payments and when they are
     disbursed.

     "We all leave here today winners with a positive outlook for a measure of
     financial assistance for our
     tobacco farmers, " Hunt said.

     During discussions wednesday, R.J. Reynolds' senior vice president, Tommy
     Payne, said his
     company had concerns about how the trust fund money would be spent and
     whether it might raise
     antitrust issues. He said Reynolds' plan to buy more tobacco would not p
     ose such problems because
     antitrust laws "do not preclude companies from coming to independent
     decisions. ' ,

     Others, however, dismissed Reynolds' concerns and questioned whether they
     were the real reason
     for the company's reluctance to sign onto the fund.
