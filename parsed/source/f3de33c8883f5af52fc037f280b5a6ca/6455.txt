TEXT:
Looks like there won't be any announcements by VP next week. Secretary
Herman will likely announce HI,KA, and MN at NAPIC on Monday.   TN has
been a little delayed--when it's ready, the VP will do a press release
(Lee Anne and Lynn Jennings have discussed this) .  GA has been more
delayed--apparently DOL had 'defunded' the Atlanta PIC under JTPA so they
cannot receive WtW funds.  The state plan needs to be revised to address
this issue. Tomorrow afternoon, DOL will have a better idea of the
revised time frame for TN and a firm fix on whether the other 3 will be
ready for Monday.
