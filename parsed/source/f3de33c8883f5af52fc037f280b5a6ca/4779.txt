TEXT:
Unless I hear otherwise by 10:00 am, tomorrow, October 15th 1997,  I will
assume you have no objection to LRMs REJ286, dated 10/14/97. The LRM
asked for comments on a draft DOJ letter strongly opposing H.R. 1252,
Judicail Reform Act of 1997.

If you (1) need another copy of the LRM, (2) intend to comment but need
more time, or (3) have provided comments that I may have overlooked,
please let me know by answering this E-mail.


Thanks,



Ron Jones
