TEXT:
Attached is a rough asssessment of the possible components of an enhanced
civil rights initiative. This proposal would result in a $101 million
civil rights initiative for FY 2000. This total does not include a
proposed $25 million to fund a Civil Rights Corps initiative (outlined as
part of the attached).  This also does not include the $27.7 million Wage
Discrimination (Equal Pay) initiative.

OMB's recommendation would result in a $40.5 million increase for civil
rights enforcement over FY 1999 funding levels (including EPA civil
rights, tribal courts, and Community Relations Service -- three items not
included in the civil rights package last year) .

The attached chart compares FY 1998 actual, FY 1999 actual, FY 2000
request, FY 2000 pass-back, and FY 2000 suggested enhancements.

     FY99 actual: $279 million
     FYOO request: $355 million
     FYOO OMB: $288 million
     FYOO JF:     $312 million (= additional $24 million)

     Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $33 million

     Last year, the EEOC received a $37 million increase, from $242 million to $279 million,
     to reduce the average time it takes to process a complaint from over 9 months to 6
     months, and the current backlog from 64,000 to 28,000 cases, by the end of2000. For
     FY 2000, the agency requested an increase of$76 million. These additional resources
     would be used to: (1) continue progress in reducing the backlog; (2) outreach to
     underserved communities; (3) wage discrimination enforcement initiative and outreach;
     (4) data collection; and (5) technology improvements and training. OMB has passed
     back a $9 million increase for FY 2000. EEOC has appealed, and now asks for an
     additional $40 million over the OMB mark (for a total of $328 million). This would
     represent a 17% increase over the FY 1999 funding level.

     Last year's increase of$37 million was significant. The FY 2000 budget should
     continue to demonstrate our commitment to this agency's work. The $9 million increase
     recommended by OMB does not demonstrate such a commitment. We could
     recommend an increase of$24 million over the OMB mark for FY 2000 to support (1)
     enhanced technology and training ($10 million); (2) streamlining the federal EEO
     program to ensure compliance with the requirement that those requesting a hearing obtain
     one within 180 days ($6 million); (3) increasing investigative staff ($6 million); (4)
     maximizing the effectiveness of ADR activities by hiring additional ADR staff for field
     offices ($1 million); and (5) outreach to underserved communities ($1 million).

     These increases do not include the $17.3 million that the EEOC has asked for their Wage
     Discrimination (Equal Pay) initiative.

     FY99 actual: $40 million
     FYOO request: $67 million
     FYOO OMB: $42 million
     FYOO JF:     $57 million (= additional $15 million)

     Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $17 million

     Last year, the Administration proposed a $22 million increase for Fair Housing and Equal
     Opportunity at HUD to increase emphasis on reducing discrimination and ensuring equal
     opportunity in housing. Part of this increase ($10 million) was to support a nation-wide
     testing initiative to "take the temperature" of housing discrimination throughout the
     country. HUD received a $10 million increase for fair housing activities, including $7.5
     million for the testing initiative. This year, OMB is recommending a $2 million increase
     for fair housing activities at HUD.

     For FY 2000, HUD has requested $67 million -- a $27 million increase -- to support fair
     housing activities. Of that total, $15 million is proposed to fund a new partnership
     initiative (the Fair Housing Partnership) to focus on new and underserved populations by
     ensuring the full protection of the Fair Housing Act and other civil rights laws (including
     immigrants, rural populations, people with disabilities, and the homeless). The request
     includes a $7.5 million set-aside for both the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP;
     funds state and local enforcement agencies) and the Fair Housing Initiatives Program
     (FHIP; funds private fair housing groups). In order to receive a portion ofthe proposed
     Partnership set-aside, State and local fair housing enforcement agencies and eligible
     private entities would be required to submit applications outlining the duties of each
     applicant, and the process by which they will work together. The Partnership would
     require state and local law enforcement agencies (which have enforcement authority, but
     have had limited success in reaching out to underserved populations) and private groups
     (that are traditionally community based, but without any enforcement authority) to engage
     in strategic planning in order to focus and coordinate their fair housing activities.

     We could recommend an additional $15 million to fund the Fair Housing Partnership.

     FY99 actual: $ 68 million
     FYOO request: $ 79 million
     FYOO OMB: $ 76 million
     FYOO JF:     $ 84 million (= additional $8 million)

     Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $16 million

     Last year, the Administration proposed a 10 percent increase for the Civil Rights Division
     -- from $65 to $72 million -- to permit the Department to continue its efforts in enforcing
     the laws that provide civil and criminal protections from discrimination, including the
     Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
     The Civil Rights Division received an increase of approximately $3 million in the final
     budget package, resulting in a total budget of $68 million.

     The Civil Rights Division has requested $79 million for FY 2000. OMB has
     recommended a $8 million increase to $76 million.

     This increase, while respectable, could be improved upon. We could propose an
     additional $8 million for the Civil Rights Division that would include: (I) a $2 million
     increase for criminal civil rights enforcement (hate crimes; violence against abortion
     clinics; worker exploitation; and misconduct by law enforcement); (2) a $2 million
     increase in enforcement against housing and lending discrimination; (3) $2 million to
     continue and further expand the Division's ADA initiatives; and (4) $2 million to prepare
     for the review, required by the Voting Rights Act, of numerous redistricting that will
     follow the 2000 Census, and to obtain necessary technology improvements.

     FY99 actual: $66 million
     FYOO request: $73 million
     FYOO OMB: $71 million
     FYOO JF:     $73 million (= additional $2 million)

     Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $7 million

     Last year, the President proposed a $6 million increase for the OCR at Education -- from
     $62 million to $68 million -- to fund technology improvements to increase productivity
     and customer service. These additional funds were also designed to be used to enable
     the Department of Education to continue to invest sufficient resources in higher education
     desegregation reviews and to focus on building partnerships with States to address
     statewide compliance with civil rights laws. In the final budget agreement, OCR
     received $66 million.

     For FY 2000, OCR has requested $73 million, a $7 million increase over FY 1999.
     OMB has passed back a $5 million increase, to $71 million. We could recommend full
     funding of OCR's original request, equal to an additional $2 million, which would allow
     them to fund (I) a demographic survey of the universe of elementary and secondary
     public school district, (2) necessary technology enhancements, and (3) increased
     provision of on-site technical assistance. The survey would be the first in over 25 years
     to provide a comprehensive demographic picture of the nation's at-risk students and
     would a useful tool for both enforcement and compliance work. Data from the survey
     could provide information on trends to Department of Education components, other
     federal agencies (such as DOJ and HHS) and other stakeholders (such as public schools,
     advocacy groups, and research organizations).

     FY99 actual: $21 million
     FYOO request: $23 million
     FYOO OMB: $22 million
     FYOO JF:     $25 million (= additional $3 million)

     Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $4 million

     Last year, the Administration sought and received an increase for HHS's Office of Civil
     Rights, increasing its funding from $20 to $21 million. For FY 2000, HHS has requested
     a $2 million increase -- to $23 million -- to continue its focus on preventative activities
     such as compliance reviews and technical assistance to ensure that persons do not
     encounter discrimination in HHS programs, including in the areas of managed care,
     access to care for minorities and people with disabilities, inter-ethnic adoption, provision
     of services limited English proficient services, and the T ANF program. OMB has
     recommended a $1 million increase for FY 2000. We could seek an additional $3
     million, bringing their total to $25 million for FY 2000. This increase would further
     support existing efforts including technology enhancement, staff training and skills
     development, and program travel. Funds could also be directed toward improving data
     collection regarding the extent of discrimination in the provision of health care or welfare
     services.

      FY99 actual: $8 million
      FYOO request: $9.5 million
      FYOO OMB: $9.5 million
      FYOO JF:     $13 million (= additional $3.5 million)

      Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $5 million

      The Community Relations Service (CRS) was funded at $8 million in FY 1999. They
      requested an increase to $9.5 million for FY 2000 to enhance their current ability to
      respond to racial unrest in communities (like Jasper, TX) by increasing staff (with an
      emphasis offield and regional conciliators) and enhanced technology. The OMS
      passback reflects this increase. We could recommend an additional $3.5 million to (1)
      provide community mediation and conflict resolution training to local governrnents, law
      enforcement, community groups and other stakeholders (techniques that can be used by
      communities as an alternative to litigation); (2) better allow the CRS to fulfill their
      commitment to provide technical assistance on hate crimes to the 93 U.S. attorneys
      around the country; and (3) support their effort to serve as a clearinghouse for racial
      dialogues and promising practices (picking up on the Race Initiative's work).

9.    Tribal Courts

      Tribal courts are essential to the maintenance of law and order in Indian communities,
      and thus provide an important part of the infrastructure necessary for community security
      and economic development. Our continued support for tribal courts is vital to the civil
      rights and self-determination interests of Indian people. In its FY 2000 budget, the
      Department of Justice asked for $10 million to support tribal courts. OMS has passed
      back $5 million. We could recommend that DOJ receive the full $10 million to support
      tribal courts.

      Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $5 million

10.   Civil Rights Corps
      Chris Edley has suggested a program to support state attorneys general in their civil rights
      work. This could be structured as a $25 million initiative that provides formula grants to
      states to support civil rights work in their attorney general offices (similar to HUD's
      Federal Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) that provides funds to state andlor local fair
      housing agencies). This could provide $500,000 per state, which would allow for the
      hiring of staff and technical assistance to local law enforcement entities (including county
      and city attorneys).

      Proposed total increase over FY 1999 = $25 million

                     1/ The FY 1998 supplemental bill added $2 million to civil rights programs at the Department of
            Agriculture, bringing the FY 1998 enacted level to $17 million, from $15 million. The President's initiative
            included the original $15 million for the Department of Agriculture, which is the number used in the totals on this
            spreadsheet.
