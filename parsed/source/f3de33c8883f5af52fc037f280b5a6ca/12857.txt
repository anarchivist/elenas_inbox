              Fair Inquiry on Media Violence

        President Clinton's decision Tuesday to open an inquiry into
                            how the entertainment industry markets violent
movies, video
                            games and other products to children should not
be allowed to
                       turn into a hunt for scapegoats. But it will be
useful if it sheds light on
                       negative industry practices and helps parents
understand and control
                       influences on their children.
                            No one is suggesting that Hollywood alone has
stoked the violent
                       youth culture that surrounds the recent rash of
school shootings in the
                       United States. Myriad social problems, from
inadequate public
                       education to failed gun control, are also to blame.
Still, entertainment
                       industry executives like Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman
Jr.--who has
                       said that teen violence is a "societal problem," not
"an entertainment
                       problemn--need to give serious consideration to the
role that violent
                       entertainment plays in real violence. It is
difficult if not impossible to


                      link a specific video or film to a specific violent
act; it is another thing
                      to link, as more than 300 studies have done, violent
behavior to
                      sustained exposure to violent entertainment.
                           The inquiry should give special attention to
the role of highly
                      violent "point-and-shoot" video games, which, as
former West Point
                      instructor David Grossman showed in recent testimony
to Congress,
                      might be desensitizing some children to killing.
                           Though Washington must keep in mind the
entertainment
                      industry's free speech rights, the inquiry should do
two specific things:

                            * Spotlight inappropriate marketing. Clinton
was right to ask the
                       Federal Trade Commission to study whether violent
material rated for
                       adult viewing is being marketed to kids. As the
trade journal Daily
                       Variety recently pointed out,   "It's hard to imagine
that Hollywood
                       does not count on kids to help pay for violent
R-rated fare like 'I
                       Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Scream.' "
                            * Encourage the entertainment industry to adopt
voluntary
                       reforms, notably a ratings system to go along with
the television
                       V-chip. That device, which lets parents block racy
or violent
                       programming, is increasingly available in new TV
sets. Federal
                       Communications Commission Chairman William E.
Kennard recently
                       praised CBS TV President Leslie Moonves and ABC
Group
                       Chairman Robert Iger for their advocacy of a V-chip
ratings system.
                           The rest of the industry needs to follow
Moonves and Iger's lead,
                      recognizing, as movie producer Robin Swicord put it
in a recent
                      Times article, that "stories and movies do change
lives."
