TEXT:
I was copied on a note from Jack to you about a retainer agreement for Strauss
and Stone.
Can you please raise this with Amy (unless there is a reason that you want me to
do it)?
Your note also mentions that we might meet on the 26th -- I'm for it, too, and
think that we should insist on a draft by that date (since filing is due the
following week, right?)
