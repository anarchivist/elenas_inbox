I understand the final Update on National Tests is now complete and out. I
have a new copy. The change we discussed on page three (adding
"Republican" was not added. I assume others did not agree with us. This
continues to bother me because it is not accurate as stated in my view but
in the end, I understand this is your call.)

After our meeting today, Michael and I continued our discussion regarding
a WH Conference of Mayors on Public Schools. We agreed that I should try
to pull a meeting together next week as early as possible with OPL,NEC and
DPC to discuss the possiblity with an eye towards announcing this
conference at the OCT. 15 meeting in Detroit of the Great City Schools and
USCM. What say you on this?
