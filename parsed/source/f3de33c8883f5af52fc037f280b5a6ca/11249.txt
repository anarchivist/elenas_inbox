TEXT:
Stephanie Streett called me to give me a heads-up that Eli called her
today reo the new wtw numbers. He was lobbying for the President to do an
event next Wednesday (day of the Ghana State Visit).   Stephanie called me
to 1) give us the heads up that he called, is waiting to hear from Bruce,
and may be .calling other people in the building, and 2) to see if we felt
strongly about trying to get something on the President's schedule for
Wednesday.

Have we gone any further with this in terms of the VP's trip, and how do
we want to proceed?
