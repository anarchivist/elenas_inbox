TEXT:
Late Friday I got the impression that the radio address for this coming
Saturday will now probably be Millenium, which I took to mean the
education tax cuts/getting ready for college one is back off. Folks at ED
need to know whether they should be doing work-up for a radio address, and
if not whether Riley can release the "Getting Ready for College" booklet
in time for all the various Back to School Activities.   They have also
been working on a "Parents' Guide to the Education Tax Cuts."   Do you
know what the latest is on this?

Thanks.
