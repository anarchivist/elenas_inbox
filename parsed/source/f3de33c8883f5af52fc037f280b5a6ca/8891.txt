TEXT:
HHS has gone back and double checked and confirmed that MD does in fact
have a statewide waiver of the 100 hour rule waiver.  We are not going to
change our paper, but wanted you to be prepared in case it should come up
in briefing.

On August 16th, just before the welfare reform law was signed, HHS
approved MD's request to expand a number of its welfare reform waivers,
including the 100 hour rule, from sub-state pilot to a statewide program.
The state didn't actually implement the waivers until October 1996.  The
background paper on 100-hour rule distributed earlier says 20 states +
D.C. did not have statewide waivers (including MD).  In fact, MD did not
belong in this list provided to us by HHS.
