TEXT:
Members of the Race Working Group:

On July 29th, from 5 to 7 pm, HUD will sponsor the second of the VP's 2020
Conferences, and the topic of discussion will be -- "Access, Opportunity,
Mobility: Making Diversity Work in American Cities.   Invited to speak at
the event are Kweisi Mfume of the NAACP, Linda Chavez-Thompson of the
AFL-CIO and Race Commission, and Professor Randall Kennedy of Harvard Law
School.  Secretary Cuomo's Deputy Chief of Staff, Rhoda Glickman, and
others would like to come over to the White House and brief interested
members of the Race Working Group on this event.   I would like to try and
schedule a briefing/meeting Friday morning -- maybe lOam -- for members of
the Race Working Group to get plugged into this event.   If you're
interested, and this time works please let me know bye-mail. If not, I'll
try and schedule something for next week.   In the meantime, I'll send an
info-pak around to everyone by inside mail.

Thank you,
Jose'

(NB: Andrew, am I missing any key folks from this distribution list?)
