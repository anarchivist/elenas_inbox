Language

1.0MB's is more cryptic and has less sympathetic rhetoric for farmers.
I think this brevity will be less reassuring to farmers.  Also, it
doesn't mention that we are watching what is going on and doesn't imply
we will continue to fulfill the commitment we made depending on the
outcome.  But Bruce seemed to agree in our staff meeting that our line is
that we are a backstop for farmers depending on the outcome of their
negotiations.
