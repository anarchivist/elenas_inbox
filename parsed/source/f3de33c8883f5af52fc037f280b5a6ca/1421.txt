TEXT:
Prep with the Women's group has been channged to 1:15. We had scheduled
the tobacco mtg. at 1, and are unable to change it to later and Bruce is
going out of town with the President tomorrow and Friday. Do you want to
go at 1:00 and hope EB is running late, but possibly leave after 15
minutes or do you want to reschedule for next week even though something
may happen on Monday? Please let me know asap.   Thanks!
