How's this:

October 1 Education Event: We are working with Sen. DaschleO,s and Rep.
GephardtO,s offices to plan a rally involving you and Congressional
Democrats to insist that Congress devote one day before it leaves to
taking up your education agenda.   Though we have not yet finalized the com
bination of new initiatives and appropriations items to highlight, it is
virtually certain that some form of Patty MurrayO,s class size initiative
will be a centerpiece.   Sen. Murray has introduced your class size bill,
including offsets that fully pay for it.   Together with Sen. Harkin, she
has also prepared a scaled-down class size initiative that would provide
approximately $500 million in additional Title 1 funding for the purpose
of reducing class size.
