TEXT:
Elena,

I left you a phone message, but I thought I should try all routes.   I am
faxing you a draft of the memo to the President drafted by NSC (though
from Berger and Bruce) re: recommendation for DED for the Haitians. NSC
has asked me for a short turn-around (by tomorrow morning) on this.   I
told them that I couldn't make any promises, but that I would see what we
could do.  Let me know if you would like to talk about all this.   Thanks.

julie
