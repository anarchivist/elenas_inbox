 TEXT:
   ,~




Ron Suskind, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Wall Street Journal reporter has
agreed to come talk to the PIR staff and other interested folks about his
recent book, A Hope in the Unseen.  The book chronicles the the life of
Cedric Jennings (who will also be at the brown bag lunch,) the son of a
jailed drug deal, raised in the ghettos of Washington DC, who overcomes
all odds and is accepted into an Ivy League University.  The author folIo
ws Cedric through his struggles to get out of Ballou Senior High School
and find a place for himself at Brown University.  The book documents the
peer pressure and other difficulties faced by a black honors student in a
tough high school where aspirations for rising out of poverty are seen as
"acting white."  It has much to say about race, class, affirmative action
and the struggles of youth.

Ron first wrote about Cedric in a pair of articles for the WSJ which later
won the Pulitzer Prize.  They will be featured in upcoming segments of
Oprah and Nightline.    Ron and Cedric will be here from 12-1pm on Friday,
May 15 in a room still to be determined in the OEOB.   Please join us.
