    MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

    FROM:         BRUCE REED
                  ELENA KAGAN

    RE:            FOOD SAFETY AND FAST TRACK


             This morning we convened a meeting of representatives from FDA, USDA, USTR, the
    White House Fast Track Working Group, and OMB including Sally Katzen, to discuss possible
    food safety initiatives to mitigate health concerns from imports following passage of fast track
    legislation.

           Below is a list of policy options that we've asked the agencies to explore and respond to
    by tomorrow morning. We asked that they consider these proposals for their feasibility for a
    formal Administration announcement within the next two days.


    1.      Upgrade Standards. We are currently implementing new procedures for domestic
    seafood and meat and poultry production, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system
    (HACCP). This is a regulatory scheme, considered more effective than simply increasing the
    number of inspectors, that involves companies identifying the danger points in their processing
    system, actions to take to avoid the contamination, and creation of a paper trail for inspectors
    to periodically review and see whether the program is working. Imported products must be
    produced under equivalent food safety systems. The proposal would expand HACCP to include
    fruits and vegetables, essentially creating US standards and then applying them to foreign
    countries. The FDA is developing this proposal.


    2.       Application of Existing US Standards. There already exist a limited patchwork of
    existing US standards for fruits and vegetables. This approach would delineate what the
    existing US standards are, and require them to be applied to imports. This has been tasked to
    FDA.


    3.        Expand USDA Involvement. USDA has research and education programs in this
    area that could be expanded. Further, if HACCP is enlarged to include fruits and vegetables,
    there will be a need for the creation of an education program for US farmers, a program that
    could be a model for foreign farmers and companies. USDA has a presence in foreign countries
    and could work cooperatively to encourage the adoption of equivalent practices there.




                                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

         4.        Applications to Trade. Explore the feasibility of the Administration committing that
         as imports increase there will be a commensurate increase in inspections/safety. Key to critics
         analysis is the argument that Fast Track will result in increased imports offood. This proposal
         would involve an Administration funding commitment to increase the level of inspections to
         keep pace with this increased supply of foreign food.


         5.     Point of Origin Labeling. This would require all food to be labeled as to origin (US or
         other nation's) at the grocery store. It would give consumers the choice to purchase domestic
         or foreign grown food. The proposal requires vetting by USTR.      Retailers do not like this
         proposal.
