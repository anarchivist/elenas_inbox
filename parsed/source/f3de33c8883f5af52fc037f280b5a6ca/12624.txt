 Disney Pulls Video Games From Park


 ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) 0* Disneyland is pulling the plug on 30 violent video
 arcade games in the amusement park and two Disney-owned hotels in
 response to the school massacre in Colorado.

 All of the games were to be unplugged by Friday and then removed by a
 vendor, the park said. Disneyland did not provide a list of titles.

 The new policy distinguishes between games in which humans are targets and
 those that are simple accuracy contests.

 "We just don't think there's any place for violent video games at
 Disneyland, " park spokesman Ray Gomez said. "This has probably been
 under consideration for a while, but the events in April brought it to the
 forefront of our thinking."

 On April 20, two teen-agers at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., shot
and
 killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before committing suicide.
