MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




        Health Care: Quality Commission Update -- On November 20, we have tentatively
scheduled an event for you to accept the Quality Commission's "Consumer Bill of Rights" and
announce your support for a Federal legislative approach (not necessarily an
Administration-specific bill) that ensures that the protections are real. In addition, we are
working with HHS to determine if they can come up with executive actions that illustrate our
commitment to apply the Commission's recommendations to Federal government programs. A
great deal of public attention to the consumer protections issue has been raised lately, largely as
the result of memos associated with the Republican Leadership (Senator Lott, Senator Nickles,
Congressman Armey) that call on their business and insurer allies to oppose Federal legislation
in this area. A quote that suggests that these industries "get off your butts and get off your
wallets" has been attributed to Senator Lott and Congressman Armey has been labeling any effort
in this area to be "Clinton II." While their strategy may be paying dividends with their target
audience, the publicity around the memos has not served the Leadership well. This is particular
the case since 85 Republicans have joined Congressman Norwood (R-GA) in supporting
legislation that goes far beyond what Quality Commission will recommend to you. Having said
this, the concern of the business community about premium increases is growing, and we are
going to have to position ourselves carefully on this issue.

        Health Care: Medicare Commission Update -- This week Senator Daschle announced
that Senator KeITey and Senator Rockefeller will serve as his appointments to the Medicare
Commission. Apparently he decided to go ahead and make this announcement and forego any
potential trade for one appointments. Neither Congressman Gephardt nor the Republicans have
announced or even finalized their decisions for the Commission.

        Health Care: Children's Health Outreach Initiative -- As you know, three million
children are now eligible and not enrolled in Medicaid. Many more children will be
eligible but not enrolled in the new children's health insurance program (CHIP). We have
                                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion

been meeting with HHS, NEC and the First Lady's office to develop ideas for a major
children's health outreach initiative. Possible policy options could include: simplifying
Medicaid eligibility rules; distributing a model single application form for both programs;
giving states access to existing but now restricted funds
for outreach; and making it easier to enroll children at schools and child care ,referral
centers.
We are also considering other private sector outreach initiatives, such having businesses
who market to parents promote enrollment. Finally, we hope to form a public/private
steering committee that would continue to develop and encourage innovative outreach
efforts. This committee could include representatives from HHS, NGA, Americorps,
America's Promise, prominent non-profit foundations, provider groups, children's
advocacy groups. If you and/or the First Lady are interested, we could design a possible
event to announce this initiative.

       Health Care: Confirmation Update on Nancy-Ann Min DeParleand Dr. Satcher--
We have been working hard to encourage Senator Lott and other Republicans to allow for final
confinnation votes for Nancy-Ann Min DeParle to become HCFA Administrator and Dr. David
Satcher for Surgeon General. It appears that there is growing fear among Republicans that the
Kyl Medicare private contracting amendment could backfire on them in this upcoming election
year. As a result, we are becoming increasingly confident that they will soon agree to vote on
her confinnation. As for Dr. Satcher, John Hilley continues to push Senator Lott to move on a
final vote on the Surgeon General as well. As of this writing, while we are increasingly
optimistic, we have no assurance they will vote on his confinnation before the Congress
adjourns.                                  .

         Crime: Brady Bill -- Next week, the Department of Justice expects to sign a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Attorney General, the Ohio Attorney
General and the Franklin County Sheriff (OH) to ensure that background checks are conducted
for all prospective handgun purchasers in Ohio. As you know, since the Supreme Court's Prinze
decision, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (BCI&I) has only been
conducting background checks on a voluntary basis. Under the proposed MOU, the Franklin
County Sheriff will initiate all background checks of purchasers who do not consent to a
background check. Arkansas is now the only state not conducting background checks on a
voluntary basis.

        Crime: Crime Statistics -- Next Sunday, the Department of Justice is tentatively
scheduled to release both the 1996 Bureau of Justice Statistics Crime Victimization Survey and
the FBI's Unifonn Crime Report for the first half of 1997. While we won't be able to review the
findings of these reports until next week, we expect them to show a continued drop in the crime
rates.

      Crime: COPS -- On Thursday, November 6th, the COPS office announced that it would
fund 96 innovative state and local law enforcement projects and 21 Community Policing


                                              2
                                                                       Hex·Dump Conversion
Demonstration Centers to provide the latest community policing information and model
strategies for police and sheriffs throughout the country.

       Crime: INS Reorganization -- On Friday, November 7th, the House JUdiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration held a hearing on the Commission on Immigration Reform's
proposal to break-up INS. Although no witnesses from the Administration were invited, Bruce
sent a letter to inform Subcommittee Chair Lamar Smith of DPC's intent to review the
Commission's recommendations and work with the Subcommittee to improve the management
and administration of the nation's immigration system.

        Crime: Stalking Report -- Next week, the Attorney General may release a report
showing that an estimated 1.4 million women are the victims of stalkers each year -- and that as
many as lout of 12 women will be stalked during the course of their lives. The Justice
Department will simultaneously release a manual of "best practices" for prosecutors to address
stalking.
