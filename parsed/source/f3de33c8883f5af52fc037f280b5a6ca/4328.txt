TEXT:
A couple of things:

1. The debate on Goodling just started, and apparantly will go on for at
least an hour. We don't yet know when tonight the vote will occur. No
one is making any specific predictions on the vote count.

2. Earlier I sent you a draft of a POTUS statement in anticipation of the
outcome. I'd like your feedback before sending it to Rahm, who asked for
it.

3. With respect to the Hoekstra block grant amendment, we think we will
win that one. Goodling, Porter and Livingston all oppose, and there is
talk that there won't even be a recorded vote on it, or that Hoekstra
could even drop it. Good news for getting to the right outcome; bad news
for our message strategy--we'd be better off if the R's all voted with
Hoekstra.
