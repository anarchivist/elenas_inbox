TEXT:
Reauthorization: Harris stressed that he needed the President to keep
pushing the issue, which the President said heD,d do, noting that he
raised it today at the Conference of Mayors.    Harris and the President
noted that Kasich might be brought around to support reauthorization, and
the President said heD,d talk to him.    The President said heD,d heard that
the Republicans might attach some family planning legislation to
Ameri.Corps that they had previously attached to legislation on UN dues,
but none of us had heard that. Harris said he wants us to slip into any
tax bill that we do this year his proposal to make AmeriCorps education
awards exempt from taxation, and the President was positive about the
idea.

Work-study and service: The President recounted that his daughter has
signed up to be an America Reads tutor, but that she was initially told
she couldnD,t participate because she was too high-income to be eligible
for work-study.  He said that colleges should round up tutors regardless
of whether the students are work-study.

Harris noted that Jonathan Alter, Joe Klein, and Steve Waldman think a key
test of whetherweD,re serious about service is whether we will continue
to push colleges to dedicate work-study to service.  The President asked
if we knew how many work-study students are participating in America Reads
or service generally. When no one seemed to know, the President said that
Riley should require colleges to report this.  Harris responded that we
know to some extent for America Reads because we ask participating co
lleges to report the data, but other colleges do.not have to report it.
Harris noted the PresidentD,s upcoming ACE(?) speech and said that might
be a good chance to raise this issue. The President said that we have to
push work-study students and college students generally out into the
communities, and that community involvement should be an essential feature
of a first-class university.  He mentioned the college-school partnerships
and said he is convinced that universities are in a position to stop the
burst of juvenile crime we might otherwise see in a few years, when the
current elementary school population become teenagers.
