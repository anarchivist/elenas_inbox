    TEXT:
    LRD is in the process of circulating two bill reports--from HUD and
    Justice--to the Constitution Subcommittee of House JUdiciary regarding
    H.R. 3206, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1998.  Both are due this


afternoon (HOD at 4, Justice at 4:30).

Because the Subcommittee will be marking the bill up tomorrow, the
deadline is firm.  Please call me if you have any questions or have not
received the draft reports.  Thanks!
