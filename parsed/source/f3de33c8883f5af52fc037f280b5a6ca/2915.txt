TEXT:
In response to Q re WH review, we replaced "We have begun a thorough
review of the provisions that may be in a final deal" with "We have begun
a process for reviewing the provisions that have been under
discussion."    He suggested first, "we have established procedures that
we will use to review a deal once it's final, " (responding to HHS
concerns) but then agreed we should use your words, "have begun," given
that meetings have started, and just drop the words "final deal."

I'll assume I should routinely run Q&As by Lindsey before circulating
unless you think that doesn't make sense.  It's usually easy to get his
quick review.
