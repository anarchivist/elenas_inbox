TEXT:
The current consensus on the TIMSS Roundtable is as follows:
Roundtable at Montgomery County Highschool with a pool spray at the top,
then closed to all press except 1 print reporter.
POTUS (only) makes remarks to student body about the importance of taking
tough classes and doing better in math and science. The thought was that
this speech was only to justify going to the school and have some
interaction with sutdents, but not to make news.  That means anything
newsworthy would be said in his pooled remarks at the top of the
roundtable. (I can certainly see this changing, but for now ... )
Per Ann and Paul's suggestions, we're going to invite the female astronaut
to attend as well.
