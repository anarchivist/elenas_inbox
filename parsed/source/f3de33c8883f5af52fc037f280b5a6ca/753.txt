TEXT:
You should both have a copy of OMB/Ken's attempt to explain why we aren't
backtracking with the size of our fix package.   The document is not too
clear at present, but I'm not sure it's possible to make this one clear.
I'm not even sure the argument works, other than just giving us the
benefit of asserting that our critics are wrong.

I think the major problem is that our $37 billion proposal never reflected
the $6 billion in goodies (child care, TANF) added late in the process,
while the final bill at $52 billion did.  So in a sense the real gulf
between us was more like $21 billion, rather than the $13-15 billion that
is in people's heads.

The best I can do at the moment is something like:

"The difference between us and the Congress on food stamp/immigrants is
and has always been $21 billion. Our current proposal would restore $18
billion of that amount.  There were other baseline changes that cloud the
comparison, but we have not changed our position.
