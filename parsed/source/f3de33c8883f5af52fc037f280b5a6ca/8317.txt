TEXT:
Attached is our list of ideas on health.   We did not divide them up into
DPC and NEC ideas, since we worked on them together (presumably, there is
some process for coordinating the ideas).

Release New Executive Order Authorizing OPM to terminate FEHBP Insurance Plans
Who Are Out of Compliance with Kennedy-Kassebaum Law. To provide additional
enforcement teeth for both states and HCF A, this policy would allow FEHBP to take actions, up
to and including termination in the plan, against insurers who have discriminated against sicker
patients. Although there have not been any new reports of problems in this area, this action
would be characterized as reducing the likelihood that we will see additional marketing and other
administrative abuses.

  Release new HHS Report on Long-Term Care and Announce Policy Initiative(s}. A new
  report from HHS shows that millions of American families care for chronically ill elderly
  relatives and friends, and this is a significant strain on families. The President could announce
  an initiative to encourage private long-term care insurance by offering it through Federal
. Employees' Health Benefits Plan and by explaining to new Medicare beneficiaries that Medicare
  does not cover long-term care and that they should consider private insurance. In addition, if we
  are willing to consider proposals with budgetary effects, we could announce a new respite care
  tax credit (still in the early stages of policy development).

Approve the 25th State Children's Health Insurance Program. As ofJune 19,20 states
have had their plans approved; In early July, we anticipate that we will approve the 25th CHIP
plan, achieving the half-way target. The states that have been approve have estimated that they
will be covering 2.5 million children when their plans are fully implemented. We could release
another progress report, maybe bring in the Governors, or bring in families who have already
been helped by the program.

Enhance Welfare-to-Work Commitment by Giving States Option to Maintain Health
Insurance for Working Adults. We will hopefully be able to bridge an impasse about
publishing the "1 OO-hour rule" reg. This will allow the states who did not have an 1115 welfare
waiver before welfare reform to have the option of expanding coverage to two-parent families
under Medicaid.

Announce Outreach Effort for Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries. A new report, to be
released by Families USA in early July, will show that about 3.9 million beneficiaries -- nearly
half who are eligible -- do not get premium assistance under Medicaid. We could announce ore
release an executive directive to order HCF A, SSA, and Administration on Aging implement
new outreach and enrollment initiatives (this could either be a proactive initiative or at least to
inoculate ourselves against a report that is likely to receive a great deal of attention).

Announce and Promote Policies for People with Disabilities. We have been working on
administrative and legislative policies to encourage de-institutionalization for: people who would
rather reside in the community. There also has been legislation on "return to work;" we could
offer policies that are affordable and paid-for in this context. These actions could be announced
on July 26, the anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act (note: the Vice President has
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

tentatively agreed to unveil a wheelchair at the FDR Memorial that day), or the President can
highlight new State Medicaid options created in the Balanced Budget Act at the National
Governors' Association conference in early August.
