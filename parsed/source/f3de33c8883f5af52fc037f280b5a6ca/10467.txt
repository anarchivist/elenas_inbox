TEXT:
I understand there's a possibility that we'd propose to only extent the
Welfare to Work tax credit for 6 months.    As you know, many of the
welfare to Work Partnership companies have lobbied for this tax credit and
think it's important to their efforts, .and I think a proposed extension of
less than a year would be viewed as walking away from an initiative we
spent a lot of time bragging about in '96 and '97.   I think they'll be
pressure from others to extend the other credits (e.g. R&E) for longer, so
at least make sure we don't get left behind!
