TEXT:
Terry Hartle, VP for govt relations at ACE, has talked to me on several
occasions about wanting us to release the affirmative action guide for
colleges. I suggested that he call you.   I said that I thought that, in
part, a decision on that was related to the issues that we discussed with
Stan a couple weeks ago.  I told him my recollection (perhaps' wrong) was
that Stan was supposed to get back to us after thinking about some
issues. That was news to Terry, so if my recollection is correct, you may
want to clarify withTerryor Stan.
