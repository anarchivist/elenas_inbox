 Folks,
 Here are talking points, done from the statement.
 If we want, we could change the title to "fact sheet" and fax it
 out. CEQ could get it to industry, labor, enviros,; Leg could
 get it to questioning members; and I could fax it to questioning
 media.
 (Ignore the formatting; because of the quirky way email
 translates wordperfect, it will have question marks instead of
 bullets, which -- I hope -- are not necessary.)
 Brian



                   TIMBER RIDER TALKING POINTS
                        February 27, 1996
 "The timber rider, as it applies to old
 o
 -growth forests,
 has ... undermined our balanced approach to growing the
 economy, having responsible logging, and preserving the
 environment."
                                                               President Clinton
                                                               February 24, 1996


 ?       The President is calling on Congress to act now on the
 timber rider.
 ?       First, the old growth provisions must be repealed.   We are
 losing ancient forests.  We are losing valuable fish runs.
 Wild places that people in the Northwest and across America
 want to protect are being lost forever.
 ?       Second, in addition to repeal, we need to be able to address
 a number of the old growth sales the courts have already
 forced us to release. Therefore, the President is calling
·on Congress to give us broader flexibility in offering
 replacement timber, and for extreme cases, buyout authority.
 ?       Third, we need to take a hard look at the salvage program.
 The salvage program has to be based on sound science.  It
 has to meet environmental laws. The President directed the
 agencies to meet these standards; however, we have heard
 many concerns about the salvage program. We have to restore
 peoples' confidence and their ability to hold public
 officials accountable. To accomplish these goals, we will
 work with the Congressional delegation, industry, labor and
 environmental groups to review our options, including
 repeal.
 ?       We're concerned that the prospect of new legislation might
 cause some companies that hold old growth sales contracts to
 mistakenly rush out and cut the trees. They don't need to
 do this. We will honor their contract rights. The
 President is calling on those companies to hold off on any
 more cutting until we find another way to honor their
 contract rights. And the Admininstration is asking the
 leaders of the timber industry to help us resolve this
 conflict.
 ?       Senator Murray is working on this kind of legislation. The
 Administration will work with Senator Murray, Senator Wyden,
 Senator Bradley, Congressman Dicks, Congresswoman Furse,
 Congressman DeFazio, others in the Northwest delegation, the

 Governors and all the stakeholders to get forest management
 back on track and to restore the balanced and reasonable
 approach under my Northwest Forest Plan.
