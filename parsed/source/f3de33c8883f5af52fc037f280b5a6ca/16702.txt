 Subject:         Literacy and Back to School

 I talked this morning with Carolyn Staley about her proposal for World
 Literacy Day September 8. We agreed - I think - on the following
      Since the President's standards initiative is under attack, he needs
 to make this the focus of his Back to School event on September 8.
       Carolyn has an excellent package of information about literacy
 including state and county data .This can be released the week before
 September 3 or 4th. She is going to talk to the VP's office to see if he
 would be interested in participating .
        The President in his September 8 address would reference some of the
 literacy figures as another example of the importance of / need for
 national standards.
