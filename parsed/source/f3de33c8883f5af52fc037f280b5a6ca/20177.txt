       Q:   What is your reaction to the passage of Proposition 227 in California?

       A.   The most important message coming from voters in California is that we have to make
            sure that students, particularly those who are immigrants or children of immigrants,
            learn English as quickly as possible. I agree with that message, though I disagres with
            the particular approach in Proposition 227.

            I opposed the Unz Initiative because it is the wrong way to accomplish this goal. The
            one-year time limit is simply too short for many students, and the one-size-fits all
            approach will limit the ability of local communities and schools to choose the best
            approaches for our children.

            But the status quo is not acceptable either. That is why I believe we must set a goal of
            helping students learn English within 3 years, give our schools the flexibility and
            assistance necessary to meet that goal, and hold them accountable if they fail to do so.
            We also have a shortage of well prepared teachers. That is also why I have asked
            Congress to double funding for training teachers who help students learn English, from
            $25 million to $50 million. No approach will work without well trained teachers, but a
            number of approaches can work well with good teachers.

       Q.   How do you explain that so many Latinos in California voted for Prop 227 in spite
            of the President's opposition?

       A.   Many Latino parents are dissatisfied with the educational opportunities available to their
            children -- as they should be. Many feel that it takes too long for their children to master
            English. That is why we have called for strengthening bilingual programs by increasing
            funding for bilingual teachers and by establishing a three year goal for all children to
            move into all-English classes. We believe this approach is preferable to Proposition 227.

       Q.   Will you support legislation currently in Congress (the Riggs bill) to overhaul the
            federal bilingual education program?

       A.   I oppose the Riggs bill. Among other problems, its requirement that schools teach kids
            English within 2 years or lose all of their funds, is too punative and will not help
            students learn English. In addition, it eliminates federal support for teacher training,
            does not provide appropriate flexibility to schools and it interferes with the enforcement
            of existing civil rights laws. Efforts to strengthen the federal bilingual education
            program should instead (1) set a goal for students to learn English within 3 years; (2)
            hold schools accountabile for results; (3) provide local flexibility for determining how
            best to achieve results; and (4) make the necessary investments in providing qualified
            teachers. I will send legislation to Congress fully consistent with these principles at
            an appropriate time.

         Q:   Will the Administration join those who are planning to bring legal action to stop the
              implementation of Proposition 227?

         A.   We are not at this time joining in legal challenges to Proposition 227. The Departments
              of Justice and Education will carefully monitor the educational programs that are put in
              place under the proposition to ensure that they comply with the civil rights laws. Whether
              they do so will depend upon how they are implemented and whether children with limited
              English proficiency are provided a realistic opportunity to succeed academically.
