TEXT:
On the three issues in dispute, Eric says the Secretary (1) was very
strongly against including the survey in the preamble -- he believes it
infuses safety issues into the rule; (2) he is admantly against including
anything on consumer education associated with the survey; and (3) he will
remove the "take off the table" phrase -- but feels strongly that the
Adminstration needs something clear: he wants the "food produced with
these products practices will not be allowed to bear the organic label."
Eric will fax a revised copy of the release to us.
