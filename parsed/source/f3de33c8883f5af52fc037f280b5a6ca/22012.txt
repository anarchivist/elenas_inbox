     Subject: Welfare-to-Work/TANF option for FY2000 budget

     The latest data on State TANF spending raise new doubts about whether we
     could reasonably expect Congress to provide $1 billion for Welfare-to-Work
     in FY 2000.  This note presents an alternative to the preliminary decision
     for a one-year, $1 billion extension of Wtw.

     TANF baseline and expenditure data.  HHS's revised TANF baseline for the
     2000 Budget reduces outlays by over $6 billion over the period FY 00-04
     (including FY99, this rises to nearly $9 billion), as described below:


(outlays in millions)
    (actual)
   FY98    FY99   FYOO    FY01     FY02     FY03     FY04         00-04
1/98 baseline 13,802    15,933     17,028     17,105    17,242    17,211
17,184
revised '99 baseline 13,284    13,071     14,496     14,912    15,622
16,765    17,848

         change from 1/98   (518)    (2,863 )   (2,533 )   (2,193 )   (1,620)
(446)         664         (6,128)

This change assumes undrawn balances of nearly $16 billion by FY 2001.
CBO, which previously projected lower outlays for FYs 99-01 than HHS, has
preliminarily indicated they will further reduce their baseline even more
than HHS. According to TANF financial data, through three quarters in
FY98 states have drawn down only 2/3 of available Federal dollars.

As illustrated in the first columns in the table below, states have also
been very slow to spend WtW funds.

Welfare-to-Work Baseline
(outlays in millions)
 (actual)
   1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 98-04
1/98 baseline 466 1,299 890 322 --- ---
revised '99 baseline 16 872 1,464 523 22 ---

        change from 1/98 (450)   (427) 574 201 22      --- (80)

Note:  1999 Baseline OL are lower in total because the FY 1999 Omnibus
Appropriation Act amended the Social Security to require unallotted State
formula grants ($79 M of FY 1998 grants) revert to the Treasury's General
fund.

Option

A "targeted" WtW program.   The $1 B passback consists of $675 M for
formula grants, $225 M for competitive grants, and $100 million for bonus
grants.   An alternative would request $250 M for competitive grants only,
targeted on particular hard-to-serve subgroups of WtW's eligible
population.   FY 2000 OL associated with this alternative would be $13
million, compared with $178 M in the $1 B preliminary decision. This
approach would:

Mirror the FY 1999 competitive grants.  In FY 1999, the $240 M competitive
pot will target $90 - $120 M on particularly needy subgroups of WtW's
eligible population, including noncustodial parents,  the disabled,
substance abusers, and victims of domestic violence.   This FY 2000
request could continue FY 1999's focused approach.

Finance the DPC "fatherhood initiative."   DPC plans to use WtW to launch
a fatherhood initiative in FY 2000.   They are exploring changes to WtW to
better target noncustodial parents, including less strict eligibility
criteria, and new program design elements, such as personal responsibility
contracts and coordination with child support enforcement agencies.   An
alternative to targeting the WtW competitive grants on several subgroups
would be to use the entire $250 M for noncustodial parents.

TANF rule changes could encourage wtW-like activities in the base TANF
program.  In addition to dramatically lower caseloads and other reasons


 cited by the Secretary in her memo to the President on TANF spending, some
 have argued that certain TANF NPRM provisions (i.e., separate state
 programs, penalty reductions, definition of assistance) have had a
 chilling effect on states providing non-cash assistance and support
 services (including WtW-like activities) .

 With the TANF final regulations currently at OMB for clearance,
 significant changes are being considered to encourage the provision of
 non-cash transitional assistance and other assistance to enhance job
 retention and advancement and earnings gains for individuals now working
 in entry-level jobs.  Specific language could be included to highlight
 allowable uses of TANF dollars to finance WtW employment activities.
