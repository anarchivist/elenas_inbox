H.R. xxxx - Kosovo and Southwest Asia Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY 1999
                             (Sponsor: Young (R), Florida)


         This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views onH.R.
xxxx, the bill making emergency supplemental appropriations for military operations, refugee
relief, and humanitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo, and for military operations
in Southwest Asia. The Administration appreciates the Committee's prompt action on the
President's supplemental request and looks forward to working with the Congress on a
bi-partisan basis on this important legislation.

       On April 19th , the President submitted to Congress a request for $6.05 billion for the
Department of Defense, the Department of State, and other international programs to provide the
funds necessary to cover the costs of the military and humanitarian operations related to the crisis
in Kosovo. Also included were funding requests to cover costs associated with on-going,
enhanced operations in Southwest Asia.

       The Administration's package:

       1.      Protects the military readiness of those forces in the Balkan theater and all other
               U.S. forces;

       2.      Ensures our military has the full measure of resources necessary to carry out the
               Kosovo air campaign; and,

       3.      Funds the U.S. commitment to provide humanitarian relief now and respond to
                  potential future refugee assistance needs.

         The fact that we are asking the Congress for funding to respond to emergency needs in
Kosovo does not in any way diminish the importance of an emergency that is very close to
home. The Central American relief package remains urgent. Every day we delay means
another day the people of Central America lose hope in their ability to rebuild their homes, earn
their livelihood, and achieve a prosperous future in their homeland.      In addition, the FY 1999
supplemental request for $100 million in assistance for Jordan is critical to stabilizing the
Jordanian economy, ensuring a smooth transition of leadership and promoting the goal of peace
in the Middle East that we all share. Also of critical importance is our request for agricultural
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

relief to our farmers.   The Administration urges the Congress to avoid confrontation by acting
quickly to enact these requests without extraneous riders and spending.

        Regrettably, the Committee-reported bill, which totals nearly $13 billion, goes well
beyond the funding requirements of the mission in Kosovo and the need to maintain current
readiness. It includes funding of over $1 billion for military construction projects, most of
which may not begin construction for several years and many of which are not even included in
the Department's long range plan. It includes significant increases for operation and
maintenance programs that have been budgeted for in the FY 2000 Budget an should be
considered during the FY 2000 appropriations process, not in an emergency supplemental bill.

STRIKE IF OBEY DECIDES NOT TO OFFER [We continue to believe that the
Administration request is the appropriate level of funding and we continue to urge the Congress
to provide funding at that level. We support efforts to reduce the amount of unrequested,
non-emergency defense funding in the bill and to provide the urgent Central America, Jordan
and agricultural relief funding discussed above.]

         Despite months of allied diplomatic efforts to achieve a balanced peace plan, the
government of Slobodan Milosevic defied the international community and pursued a course of
repression and terror against the people of Kosovo. We determined that we could not allow
these actions to go unchallenged.      Now, we have a responsibility to our country and to the
men and women serving our country in the Balkans and to address the humanitarian crisis
provoked by the Milosevic government.         The Administration has provided Congress with our
best estimate of the resources required to achieve our goals in Kosovo. Now is not the time to
slow progress on our emergency supplemental request by adding funding unrelated to the
mission or to maintaining current readiness or by adding extraneous provisions.

        As the President stated on April 28'\ "My request fully funds our military and
humanitarian needs in Kosovo. Congress should resist the temptation to add unrelated
expenditures, even important ones, which could delay the process, because that would undermine
the very goals that this funding is intended to meet."   We ask the Congress to act quickly upon
this request and send a clear message to Milosevic - his actions will not be tolerated and we are
prepared to back our words with action.
