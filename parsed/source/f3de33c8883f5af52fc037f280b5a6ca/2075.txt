TEXT:
As we discussed, I think we need to have a higher level group comprised of
"principals" to develop an outline, or framework on the report.  This
group would also later review the progress of a second staff level group
that would draft tne nuts and bolts of the report.

Proposed principal group:

1) DPC: Elena, Jose, Leanne
2) WH Counsel: Dawn Chirwa, Karen Popp
3) Justice: Kent Markus, Jonathan Schwartz
4) ONDCP: Ed Jurith (maybe one more here)

I don't think it is necessary to include Treasury, but if we do, we should
invite David Medina.

Rahm should review the outline and could be invited to the final meeting
to discuss draft and how we would roll it out.

Let me know what you think of this proposal.    Thanks.
