TEXT:
Elena,

A stray thread floated out of the rumor mill indicating that someone in
your shop is meeting this week with Utah education officials who want to
share their thoughts about the fiscal effects of the President's
establishment of the new national monument in Utah.

If it would be helpful to you or yours, and not a rude, pushy, intrusive,
unwelcome pain, I'd be prepared to sit in on the meeting or share ideas in
advance.

In any event, be advised that these folks have previously asserted some
remarkable things that don't square with anything we (or Interior)
recognize as fact.

I hope you're well.

Torn
