  TEXT:
  I think Mickey's points are all very good--did you fax this to Karen--she
  should really see it before it goes in.  I faxed you my edits which you'll
  see are less extensive then Mickey's but pelase consider.  I think the
  only other point I would make is that it's really important not to set a
  three year time limit--make it an aspirational goal--also should we start
  changing the language to refer to language acquisition so that the
  negatives that bilingual has starts to be countered.  tal;k to you tonight
  about thius.

 Subject:         Re: Unz memo

 Good memo Mike. Please consider the following comments/suggestions:

 -I think adding a paragraph to describe the outreach effort and internal
 WH process we used is important for the President to know. In fact, a
 vigorous coordinated outreach effort by OPL, IGA, POL, and LEG, with DPC
 and Education was conducted to help us prepare this memo. The President
 should know we met with Mr. Unz, national advocay groups, California
 elected officials, and others both in California and Washinton, DC.   I
 think it is relevant that Maria, Mickey, Janet, Karen, and Michael all
 spent time personally on the issue.

 -I'm not comfortable with the second paragraph which describes current
 public opinion. I think we have polls (see Ross poll) now that are showing
 support for Unz dropping and this is BEFORE any real opposition campaign
 has 'begun. Also, I think that while we all remember the initial 84% Latino
 support figure from an LA Times poll, we have not put this one poll in the
 context of the longstanding support of bilingual education in previous


  polls and voter exit interviews contained in the Andy Hernandez memo of
  February 16. I just think we need to soften the lead on this paragraph a
  bit.

  -In the third paragraph I think we should insert the opportunity this
  issue provides us to advocate for our comprehensive action plan of
  research-based solutions to raising education attainment of Latino
  children the President has proposed. You do get to it later in the memo; I
  just think you should mention it earlier too.

  -Mention that Ron Unz challenged Pete Wilson for the Republican nomination
  in 1994 for governor.

  -On page five at the top talking about polls again, please insert
  "currently". It should read "Latino voters are CURRENTLY split .... " I also
  think it is fair to remind folks that the LA Times and Field polls did not
  accurately predict the Latino vote in the end for either prop 187 nor
  209.  77% of Latinos opposed 187 and 70% opposed 209 according to voter
  exit interviews in contrast to some polls which showed a split Latino vote.

  -Jane Harman is opposed. Al Checci is opposed. Dan Lungren (R), candidate
  and likely California nominee for Gov. is undecided. He has stated that he
  has concerns and will decide soon.

  -We should add that a well financed campaign is expected by Unz for his
  initiative while the opposition campaign is struggling to raise the money
  necessary to conduct a credible campaign. Richie Ross is the lead
  consultant/organizer of the oppostion effort. He is very good.
