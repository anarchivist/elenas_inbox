TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:

I spoke to NSC and told them: (1) If at all possible, it was our
preference not to have to send this memo to the President; (2) We want to
make sure the memo and accompanying legislation make clear the
Administration's intent to work withe research community before
finalizing/passing an expansion of the biological weapons statute; and (3)
If the memo must go forward, we would support the NSC/Justice option.

Jose'
