TEXT:
What I suspected was true is true -- USDA has been visiting and collecting
information on these waiver requests as we requested, but they're not sure
how much longer they can drag this out.  I've asked them to write up a
status report on Arizona, Florida and a new waiver request from
Wisconsin, and I think we may want to meet with them to discuss next
steps.

Kris -- I can check this out.

The welfare reform law required USDA to respond to waiver requests within
60 days to
(1) approve (2) deny or (3) ask more questions.  When we last met in the
EOP on this topic, we agreed that USDA should ask Arizona more questions;
in April, we told USDA to do the same thing for Florida. Historically,
USDA has been good about following our guidance but I will call' them and
let you know.
