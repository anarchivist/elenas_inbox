TEXT:
Eli Segal just called me. He cannot meet tomorrow and instead gave me his
ideas of what he has in mind for a POTUS out of town event.

Later in the week Stephanie and I will be calling a meeting to discuss
upcoming conferences (welfare to work, child care, hate crimes and race
town halls) .

I am happy to proceed with the. 1:00 pm meeting in Ann's office tomorrow.
Otherwise, we could wait and discuss welfare to work in the larger meeting
on conferences.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thanks.
