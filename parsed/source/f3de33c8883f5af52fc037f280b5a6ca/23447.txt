                              CDC: Anti-Smoking Campaign Works

                              By PATRICIA J. MAYS Associated Press Writer

                              ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among middle school
students in
                              Florida dropped 19 percent in the year since the
state launched
                              an aggressive anti-tobacco campaign aimed at
children, the
                              federal government said Thursday.

                              The decline, which is larger than any nationally
among youth
                              since 1980, could indicate that the prevalence
of teen smoking
                              has peaked, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention


                        said.

                        The number of Florida middle school students who
reported
                        having smoked cigarettes declined from 18.5
percent in
                        February 1998 to 15 percent in February 1999.
Cigarette use
                        among high schoolers dropped from 27.4 percent
to 25.2
                        percent during the same period.

                        The Florida Legislature last year allocated $70
million to
                        vigorously enforce smoking age limits and for a
series of TV
                        and radio ads produced by teen-agers that poke
fun at the
                        tobacco industry. The program started last April.

                        "These results show why every state should have a
                        comprehensive program to reduce youth smoking
and why I
                        oppose any legislation waiving the federal
government's claim to
                        tobacco settlement funds without making a
commitment from
                        the states to fund such efforts," President
Clinton said in a
                        statement.

                        Since Florida's program was implemented, cigar
use among
                        middle school students dropped from 14.1 percent
to 11.9
                        percent, the CDC said. And fewer sixth-,
seventh- and
                        eighth-graders are using smokeless tobacco
4.9 percent,
                        down from 6.9 percent.

                        Cigar and smokeless tobacco use dipped only
slightly among
                        high schoolers.

                        After the tobacco industry reached a $206
billion settlement
                        with states last November, the nation's two
largest cigarette
                        makers increased wholesale prices by 45 cents a
pack. The
                        CDC said the higher prices also may have lowered
the rates of
                        teen smoking.

                        The study was based on 1998 and 1999 Florida
Department of
                        Health surveys of 20,000 public school students.
