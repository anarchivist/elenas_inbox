TEXT:
FYI -- Claxton have several technical amendments to the Durbin lookback
amendment when we, OMB, and Treasury have scrutinized.  I plan to call Tom
Falletti and talk to him before sending them to Lloyd Ator.  The
amendments:

        1) Make sure the lookback funds go to public health (since the
Durbin section numbers are different, a reference in the spending title
must be changed) .

        2) Clean up language regarding application to new manufacturers or
manufacturers below the de minimus level.

        3) Adds in several places "based on the annual performance survey"
to make clear where the numbers will come from.
