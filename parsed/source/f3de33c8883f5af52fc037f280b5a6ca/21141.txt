 AND CALLS ON CONGRESS TO HELP IMPROVE, MODERNIZE SCHOOLS
 "The ultimate national security of any country res Is in the strength of its own citizens. Andfor us, that
means we have got to prove that no matter how diverse we are, we can still offer a world-class education
to every single American child." -President Clinton, August 31, 1998

"Baby Boom Echo" Yields 52.7 Million Schoolchildren this Fall. Joined by roughly 50
Members of Congress, and education, community and business leaders in more than 80 cities across the
United States, President Clinton on Tuesday, September 8, will release a new Department of Education
report -- the third annual Report on the Baby Boom Echo. The findings include:
        ·        52.7 million children attend public and private elementary and secondary schools in
                 America today -- the highest school enrollment ever.
        ·        2.2 million teachers will need to be hired over the next ten years.
        ·        A record 14.6 million students will attend college this year.
The report includes current and projected data on specific states, as well as data on recent growth in
selected suburban communities across the country.

Communities Cite Needs, Successes on National School Modernization Day. According
to a recent GAO Report, about 14 million students attend schools that need extensive repair or
replacement of one or more buildings. Almost 60 percent of America's schools reported at least one
major building feature in disrepair. In communities across the country, elected officials, parents, business
leaders and others will gather to hear the President's remarks, and discuss their own communities'
strategies for school construction and renovation, achieving smaller class sizes with well-qualified
teachers, and taking advantage of new technologies. These local forums are part of National School
Modernization Day on September 8.

President Clinton Calls for Immediate Action by Congress. The President will urge
Congress to help America address these pressing needs by enacting -- in the next month before leaving
Washington -- the education agenda that he first proposed in the State of the Union address, including:
·     BUILDING AND RENOVATING OVER 5,000 SCHOOLS. The President has proposed School
      Modernization Tax Credits to help provide all students with safe, state-of-the-art school bUildings.
       The proposal would use Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds.
·     HIRING 100,000 TEACHERS TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE. President Clinton is committed to
      helping local schools provide smaller classes with well-prepared teachers in the early grades. The
      initiative would provide $12.4 billion over seven years to reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a
      nationwide average of 18 and help make sure that every child receives individual attention, gets a
      solid foundation for further learning, and learns to read independently and well by the end of third
      grade.
·     HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY FOR EDUCATION. The Clinton Administration has made an
      unprecedented commitment to bring technology into the classroom and ensure that all children are
      technologically literate by the dawn of the 21 st century. However, the House appropriations bill
      cuts the President's request for educational technology by $180 million, while the Senate cuts it by
      $98 million. They eliminate $75 million for technology teacher training, which would help new
      teachers learn to use technology effectively to strengthen instruction and enhance student learning,
      and they also cut $50 million from the President's request for the Technology Literacy Challenge
      Fund, which would deny funding to 400 school districts to provide students and teachers with
      access to classroom computers, training and the latest educational software and
      telecommunications technology. The President will also continue to strongly oppose any effort by
      the Congress to repeal or delay the e-rate -- an expansion of universal service to provide
                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-~ump Conversion
