     PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES INTRODUCTION OF SENATE FOOD
       SAFETY LEGISLATION AND REPORT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF
           IMPORTED AND DOMESTIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES
                            March 4, 1998

Today President Clinton will announce the introduction of legislation by Senators Milkulski and
Kennedy to ensure the safety of all imported foods, including fruits and vegetables. This·
legislation will enhance the Food and Drug Administration's authority to prevent the import of
fruits, vegetables, and other food products that do not meet U.S. food safety requirements. The
President also will announce the release of a report that provides a blueprint on how the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA)
will work cooperatively with the agricultural community to develop guidance on good
agricultural and manufacturing practices for fruits and vegetables.

Enhanced FDA Oversight for Imported Foods. The food safety legislation to be introduced
today in the Senate will provide greater assurance that imported foods meet U.S. food safety
requirements or achieve the same level of protection required for comparable domestic products.
The President will call on Congress to promptly enact this crucial next step in improving the
safety of all the food that reaches Americans' tables. The legislation also will permit the FDA to
halt imports from countries or facilities that do not allow FDA inspections to occur. This
legislation gives FDA authority that is comparable to USDA's existing authority to prevent the
importation of unsafe meat and poultry. The President already has committed to providing
approximately $25 million in his Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to dramatically
expand its international food inspection force. Reps. Eshoo and Pallone previously have
introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives.

Development of Guidance on Good Agricultural and Manufacturing Practices. The
President will announce the release of a report that provides a roadmap for the Secretary of
Health and Human Services, in partnership with the Secretary of Agriculture and in cooperation
with the agricultural community, to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing
practices. This report outlines the progress already made -- and the measures still to be taken --
to develop guidance for the growing, processing, shipping, and marketing offruits and vegetables
by October 1998. The guidance -- the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and
vegetables -- will address potential food safety problems throughout the production and
distribution system and help ensure the sanitation and safety practices of all those seeking to sell
produce in the U.S. market. The report also provides both short- and long-term plans for
technical assistance, education, and outreach activities to support the appropriate application of
the guidance.
