TEXT:
I was a little confused, and a little unhappy, about tobacco yesterday ...

The reason I scheduled a meeting yesterday in my office was for you and I
to follow through on what we discussed, which was a policy meeting on
tobacco (as distinct from a scheduling meeting).  (This was what you and I
discussed in the ward room) .

So I was surprised when a) you weren't able to attend, and b) it turned
out· that the "real" meeting had just been held, sans my participation,
with extensive discussion of a presidential statemnt. There was no point
to having the meeting in my office yesterday, so I cancelled it.

Please invite me to future meetings on tobacco that might implicate either
the April 15th event or Presidential statements when the decision comes
down (which I gather will not be until the 14th at least).

Thanks.
