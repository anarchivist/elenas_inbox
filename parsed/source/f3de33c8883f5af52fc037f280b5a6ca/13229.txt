TEXT:
Peter Coppelman called and has also talked to Jim and Mark Gaede.
Gippert, the USDA lawyers and trial lawyers are predictably upset.
Their argument is that we stipulated to an expedited briefing
schedule so that there would be a decision before the logging
season in March and that it's a very tight schedule.
Frankly, this is outrageous - neither Lyons nor Kennedy even knew
that from their own lawyers this was taking place days after the
President's veto.
Lois is working towards readjusting the schedule to ask for a one
week extension.
