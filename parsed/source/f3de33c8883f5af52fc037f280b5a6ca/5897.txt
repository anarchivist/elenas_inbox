TEXT:
As you know, I think we should have someone in the gallery    at the State of
the Union who moved from welfare to work in the last year.     The President
praising her could be a great applause line, and could put    a human face on
the new case load numbers we have to announce. There is of    course a risk
-- a risk that we'll pick someone who will be unemployed a    year from now.

Even if there's just a slim chance you'll want to do this, we should start
identifying someone now, to help minimize this risk.  Should we start
doing that?
