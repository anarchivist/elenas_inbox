TEXT:
Good news -- our memo on FMLA expansion works well with earlier memo.
The 120 day reports POTUS requested from agencies on their family friendly
activities are in. NPR released a short summary of the reports on March
7 (w/a cover letter from the VP). Agencies are providing referrals for
edler and child care services, but none of the agencies reported efforts
to provide leave for child and elder services. NPR staff think our memo
will help move agencies along ... and POTUS can take credit in his remarks
for the progress we have made.
