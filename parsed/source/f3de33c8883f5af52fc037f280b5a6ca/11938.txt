TEXT:
Rod Kuegel (KY burley) called to say the following: As you recall, PM was
getting ready to announce that it would move from buying tobacco through
the quota system to buying it via direct contract with the farmer.   This
would have put the farmer directly under the thumb of the company and
destroyed the quota system. But Phillip Morris, unexpectedly,    did not
announce this -move. Rod's explanation? He says the companies knew about
our meeting (the tobacco farm leaders coming to the WH)  and feared
creating an unholy alliance for new taxes -- so they backed off. Rod
suggests another meeting to further the buzz and to discuss any GATT ideas
we have.
