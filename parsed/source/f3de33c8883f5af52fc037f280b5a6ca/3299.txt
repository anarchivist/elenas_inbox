TEXT:
As you know from Jen, HRC wants to be involved in the immunization event
and she is not available until the week of the 21st. Shalala is
unavailable the 21 and 22nd, so right now we recommend trying to change
the event to the 23rd.  I'm happy to work through this with scheduling and
communications, but wanted to check with you first to see if you want to
offer an alternative event for the 14th.

Based on a conference call with Jen, Chris Jennings, and Melissa
Skolfield, the participants of the event would be:
- POTUS
- HRC
- Real person (mother, or pediatrician)
- Jimmy Carter

Also on stage could be:
- Rosalyn Carter
- Sen. and Mrs. Bumpers
- Sec. Shalala

We will figure out a way for POTUS to have a photo-op with some 2 year old
children and their parents    perhaps a photo-op somewhere else in the
Residence before the event or bringing them in at the end of the event.

Right now the event is scheduled for the East Room.  The audience would
include bipartisan Members of Congress, Governors, relevant Administration
folks and key organizations/Associations.

Paper: 1) Fact sheet of the announcements and President's record on
immunizations; 2) background document on different types of immunizations
and the history of the child immunization initiative; 3) Q&A.
