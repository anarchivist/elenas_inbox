TEXT:
We're hearing that Repubs will file a cloture petion on this bill tomorrow
which would put it on the floor early next week -- they're timing it for
our summit in Philly of course.  I've talked to DOJ and National Service
folks.  DOJ said their statement will be over here tomorrow.  I've also
talked to Hollings' folks and they think they can offer up an alternative
but we'll talk again about what that would look like. Elena and Bruce,
can you guys take a look at this Justice stuff tomorrow and let me know if
it's going in the right direction, i.e., not conflicting on where we are
on product liability? txs
