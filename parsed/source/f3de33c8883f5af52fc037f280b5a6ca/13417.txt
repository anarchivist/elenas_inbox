Product Liability
Wednesday, March 13, 1996

Background
A House and Senate conference today reached agreement on a
package of product liability reforms.  It would set a 15
o
-year
time limit on when a manufacturer can be held liable for its
products, and caps the awarding of punitive damages.
[Per advice from OMB and Leg Affairs, Bruce Lindsey is the best
person to talk to regarding the Administration's position on this
bill.]
The Admnistration has not made a decision on whether to support
the bill or not.    The agreement reached today still includes a
cap on punitive damages which the White House opposes.
Points
o       We are still in the process of reviewing the bill and have
not yet made a determination on whether it meets the
President's goals of real, balanced reform.
o       The Administration supports the enactment of limited but
meaningful product liability reform.
o       SAP: Any legislation must fairly balance the interests of
consumers with those of manufacturers and sellers and should
respect the important role of the states in our federal
system.
