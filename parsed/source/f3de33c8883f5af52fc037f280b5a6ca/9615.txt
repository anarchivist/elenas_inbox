     Rep. Joseph R. pitts' (R-PA) "efforts to help Amish tradesmen get
around child
           labor laws faces opposition" from Congress, Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-PA) said 10/5.
           pitts has asked Specter to push his legislation in the Senate,
but Specter said he is
           concerned "the proposal may be unconstitutional." Specter said
he is also "worried that it
           provides insufficient safeguards for young workers." But
Specter added that he "may
           introduce the legislation in the Senate to promote discussion,
although it faces no chance
           of passage during the few days remaining in the current
session." Specter made his
           comments after touring  a woodworking shop that employs numerous
Amish workers
           who make wood furniture. Specter: "Congressman pitts'
legislation has a good many
           safeguards to limit access by the youngsters and also to
require adult supervision, but
           there's an issue as to whether that can be realistically
enforced, and that's something that
           has to be considered. The Department of Justice sent us a
letter saying that they thought
           the bill would be unconstitutional as favoring a religion."
pitts has been trying to help
           Amish in his district by allowing youths between 14 and 18,
"whose religion does not
           permit formal schooling beyond the eighth grade," to work in
woodworking shops and
           sawmills, so long as they aren't allowed to operate woodworking
machinery, such as
           band saws (Delaney, Lancaster Intelligencer- Journal, 10/6).
