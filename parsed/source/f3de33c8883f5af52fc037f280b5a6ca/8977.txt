TEXT:
I spoke the Chief. He is happy to speak in the program, and to give
anecdotes of large capacity clips seized in Westchester. He said he would
speak regardless of whether the Mayor attends.  (Obviously, we need to
make sure the Mayor is ok, and not going to change this.)

I will tryon Monday to get in touch with the Co-Chair of the neighborhood
citizens patrol, who would be a good person to introduce the Chief if we
have the room.  We can discuss Monday.
