MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                       GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:               Expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)

Overview

        This memorandum details several options to increase the cap on the LIHTC and to
potentially index to the rate of inflation in future years. This initiative, along with proposals to
raise the number of incremental vouchers, expand homeownership, and strengthen the Fair
Lending Law would build on the housing successes of your first four years.

Affordable Housing and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

         Enacted as part of the Tax Refonn Act of 1986, and made pennanent by you in 1993,
the LIHTC offers corporate and individual investors a credit against their federal income taxes
based on the cost of acquiring, rehabilitating, or constructing low-income housing. The tax
credit is a major federal resource for affordable housing, producing about 110,000 low-income
rental units per year. In 10 years, the LIHTC has helped create more than 900,000 units of rental
housing nationwide.

        However, because the amount ofthe LIHTC that can be allocated each year is capped
relative to the population, its ability to serve its public policy mission is being eroded by
inflation. The amount of the LlliTC that states may allocate each year is $1.25 times the state's
population. Since 1986, the purchasing power of the LIHTC has eroded by about 45%; if the
cap had been indexed in 1986, the current credit would be more than $1.75 per capita.

        After several years of attacks from conservative Republicans to repeal the credit on the
grounds that it is a fonn of "corporate welfare" and your repeated vetos of·efforts to sunset the
LIHTC, the credit currently enjoys bipartisan support in Congress and across the nation among
state and local officials. Senators D' Amato and Graham have introduced legislation (S. 1252)
that would provide for a significant increase in the annual volume cap. Groups such as the
Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) are strong supporters of this legislation.

Options

I. Index LIHTC for Inflation -- An inexpensive option would be to change the LIHTC statute
and index the LIHTC to the Consumer Price Index. This would insure that the credit does not
experience any additional future decline in value from inflation. However, this proposal would
not make up any of the lost value of the credit since 1986.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

2. Raise the LIHTC Cap -- Cost: $350 million to $600 million -- This is a moderate-cost
approach that would partially offset the real loss of the credit value since 1986. For roughly
$350 million over five years, we could increase the credit from its current value of$1.25.to $1.38
per capita. A more expensive, but still moderate approach, would be to increase the credit to
$1.50 per capita, which would cost approximately $600 million over five years. We could also
add indexation to one of these increases, but this (a) would increase the costs and (b) Tax Policy
at Treasury believes that this would recreate the inefficiency problems the program suffered
through several years ago.

3. Support S. 1252 (D' Amato-Graham) -- This proposal would increase the annual volume cap of
the LIHTC to $1.75 per capita and index it for future years .. This proposal would cost $1.5 to $2
billion over five years.

Recommendation

         Tax Policy at Treasury raises several concems with any raise in the cap on the LIHTC
(e.g., there are more efficient ways to increase low-income housing than using the tax code and
having tight caps increases the efficiency of the program since projects must compete vigorously
for the credit). While their argument has some merit, the LIHTC has proven to be an
increasingly efficient tool and remainss the only politically feasible option available to help build
more affordable housing for people with low incomes. Moreover, LISC, Enterprise Foundation,
and the other community development groups view the LIHTC as yours, since you were the one
who permanently extended it. If Congress acts this year to increase the cap -- which is likely --
and we do not have a proposal on the table, you may lose the LIHTC as one of your lasting
legacies.

        The DPC and NEC recommend that you chose option 2. Option 2 would provide a
modest increase in the LIHTC, while ensuring that the efficiency effects from relatively tight
caps remain. The DPC and NEC believe that option 1 -- while ensuring that the credit is no
longer eroded by inflation -- is too small and Tax Policy believes that as the caps are increased
over time, the efficiency of the program would decrease. Option 3 -- at a cost of $1.5-$2.0
billion -- may not feasible in the current constraints of the budget.
