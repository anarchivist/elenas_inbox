MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:       POLICY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE RACE INITIATIVE


        This memorandum proposes a policy development process for the Race Initiative -- and
recommends an initial policy announcement to be unveiled at the NAACP's annual meeting on
July 17th. Although we would have preferred to develop this process with the assistance of the
Race Commission's staff director, we believe that it is of critical importance to get started right
away. Thus, we recommend that DPC immediately convene three workgroups in the key areas
of economic empowerment, education and administration of justice, and that a fourth issue --
health -- be addressed through DPC's ongoing relationship with HHS.

        Our goal for these workgroups is three-fold: (1) to provide a statistical "snapshot" of
racial and ethnic minorities and, thus, an informed starting point for policy development; (2) to
assess the impact of Administration initiatives on racial and ethnic minorities; and (3) based on
our analysis, to recommend policy initiatives to announce throughout the upcoming year -- as
well as longer-term policies to incorporate into the Race Commission's final report.

L   WORKGROUPS

       A. Economic Empowerment

        Managed jointly by DPC and NEC, this group's mission will be to look for ways to
promote job growth and the culture of work among disadvantaged minorities. Increasing job
opportunities for unemployed and underemployed blacks and Latinos, and assimilating them into
the workplace, is the way to strike right at the economic root of racism in our society. Jobs give
minorities what they want most -- a chance to participate in the mainstream economy -- and help
dispel majority fears about racial and ethnic minorities who are at the margins of society. Other
participants in the Economic Empowerment group will include: CEA, OVP, OMB, Treasury,
Labor, HUD, HHS, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, SBA and Transportation.

        We have already met with the CEA to begin compiling the economic data for this task.
Some analysis was conducted during the Administration's affirmative action review, but more
needs to be done. We will also specifically examine a. host of Administration initiatives --
including the Welfare jobs initiative, EITC, EZs, CDFIs, changes to CRA, the minimum wage
increase, One Stop Career Centers and Capital Shops, HUD's Bridges-to-Work, Home

                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
and build on existing economic efforts wherever possible.

        With respect to longer-term policy development, the Economic Empowerment group will
also look at other topics, such as: (1) strengthening job recruitment networks; (2) matching and
transporting workers to where there us worker demand; (3) promoting mixedcincome,
multi-racial communities; (4) affordable housing strategies; (5) housing mobility; and (5) rural
economic development.

       B.   Education

        This group, which will be managed jointly by DPC and the Department of Education,
will consist of two subgroups: one specifically to look into the dramatic drop in minority
enrollment at the Universities of California and Texas; and one to promote improvements in
elementary and secondary education. If addressing the "jobs gap" is the most visible and
immediate way to begin addressing economic disparities and racial stereotypes, than increasing
levels of education among disadvantaged minorities must be our primary long-term challenge.

        The experience of Latinos in many parts of our country makes clear the importance of
education to climbing the economic ladder. While Latinos in some cities have been able to
overcome discrimination in hiring and develop successful job recruitment networks -- often
leading to coveted industrial jobs -- their average income is either stagnant or declining. A
recent study by the Woodstock Institute in Chicago found that while unemployment rates for
Hispanic Empowerment Zone (EZ) residents were half that of their African American
counterparts, their average income was considerably lower than that of employed African
Americans.

        The Minority Enrollment subgroup will consists of DPC, White House Counsel,
Education and Justice, and has already started to meet and collect data. In addition to DPC and
Education, the broader subgroup on elementary and secondary education will include NEC,
CEA, OVP, OMB and HHS. This group will look at how performance standards, teacher
training, technology and infrastructure improvements can help our poorer schools. Also, we are
particularly interested in reviewing what Mayor Daley of Chicago and other mayors are doing·
to turn their school systems around, and how such comprehensive -- and race neutral -- changes
can benefit all Americans.

       C.   Administration ofJustice

         This group will also be split into two subgroups, both led by DPC: the first will focus on
crime control and prevention; and the second will target government-wide enforcement of our
civil rights laws. Other members of these groups will include: OVP, OMB, Treasury, DOl,
Education, Labor, HUD, HHS, Agriculture, Interior and EOC.
and ethnic minorities. Although minorities, particularly in our inner cities, are the most likely
victims of crime, they have been historically under protected by local law enforcement. Even
now, as crime has dipped to its lowest level in 35 years, initial data indicate that minority
communities have not benefitted as much from this decline as other communities. This is
especially true for Indian Country, where the homicide rate has jumped more than 80 percent
since 1992.

         We strongly believe that the Administration's community policing initiative is on the right
track and helping to reverse the trend of under protection. It is helping thousands of
communities put more police in neglected, high-crime areas -- as well as allowing police officers
to work collaboratively with community residents to solve a broad spectrum of crime problems
(youth violence, domestic abuse, hate crimes, etc.) With more than 40,000 new police officers
to be hired, there is still much the Administration's community policing -- and other crime
initiatives -- can do to address the considerable public safety needs of minority communities.

        The Civil Rights Enforcement group will seek to develop a coordinated strategy and
common mission for the many federal agencies involved in civil rights enforcement. In addition
to reviewing how to reduce the considerable backlog of cases in some of these agencies, the Civil
Rights group will' tackle and troubleshoot some of the policy quandaries that arise when
communities try to be innovative. For instance, the Fair Housing Act has prevented some EZs
from targeting their housing monies to EZ. residents. Similarly, school districts that have tried
to improve by implementing initiatives such as teacher testing have come into conflict with Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act.

       D. Health

        Instead of establishing a new work group to review health issues, we intend to build on
DPC's close working relationship with HHS and existing health initiatives.. HHS has already
commenced an internal review to identify disparities in health needs and the provision of services.
  Also, we are reviewing the Administration's immunization initiative to see how it has impacted
racial and ethnic minorities, and considering how we can ensure that the low-income children's
health initiative meets the significant needs of certain minorities.

II INITIAL EDUCATION ANNOUNCEMENT

        We are recommending that you announce a two-part education initiative when you speak
to the NAACP on July 17th. This initiative, which will be included as part of the
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, focuses on improving teacher recruitment and
preparation, with a particular focus on preparing teachers to teach in urban and poor rural school
systems. The teacher preparation component of the program will provide funds to partnerships
involving institutions of higher education with exemplary teacher preparation programs, other




    institutions of higher education seeking to strengthen their teacher preparation programs, and
    local school systems that will employ new teachers. These partnerships will work together to
    implement teacher preparation programs that effectively equip new teachers to teach in urban and
    rural environments.

             The second component funds scholarships for individuals preparing to teach; scholarship
    recipients will be required to teach for at least three years in an under served community. Funds
    will be distributed on a competitive basis to partnerships of eligible local school systems and
    institutions of higher education. The partners together will define the priority local needs (e.g.,
    teachers in particular disciplines, specialties or grade levels) and target populations (e.g.,
    mid-career adults, paraprofessionals already in the classrooms, or more traditional teacher
    candidates), and will provide scholarships to individuals meeting these criteria.

            By focusing on better training for teachers and improving our neglected schools, we
    believe that you will be in a strong position to urge the NAACP not to abandon it long history in
    support of integration -- and to support the Administration's education initiatives.
