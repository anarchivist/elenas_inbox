Message Creation Date was at 21-MAR-1997 10:47:00



Starting next week, DPC staff meetings will be held Tuesday and Thursday

at

9:00 am.



please make certain that you do not schedule any other meetings during

those

times.     Bruce wants everyone to attend our staff meetings and to be on

time

(yes myself included).    We believe switching to Tuesday and Thursday

should

insure that everyone will attend.



The meetings will still be held in room 211.
