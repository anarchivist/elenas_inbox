TEXT:
I'm hearing from Don Baer indirectly (through Nicole Elkon) that food safety
event probably won't be Tuesday, may be Thursday.  She thought we would know by
tomorrow a.m.  We will be ready for Tuesday if necessary.  I'll have fact sheet,
directive, and q's and a's later today and will leave for your review.
Also, sounds like OMB hasn't decided yet whether to announce any 98 budget items
next week and, if so, which ones.  Raines staff will push him to focus on food
safety specifically and urge him to push for a decision at 7:30 meeting tomorrow.
