TEXT:
Below is the draft Transportation FY99 Appropriations letter.  The House
is expected to appoint conferees at 10:30am tomorrow (Tuesday, 9/15).
Obey's staff has asked to have the letter at that time.  Therefore, please
provide comments/clearance by 9:30am tomorrow. Thank you.

The Honorable Robert Livingston
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
u.s. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
views on H.R. 4328, the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as passed by the House and by the Senate.
As the conferees develop a final version of the bill, your consideration
of the AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates that both the House and Senate have
made efforts to accommodate many of the PresidentD,s priorities in their
respective action on the bill.  However, the allocation is simply
insufficient to make the necessary investments in programs funded by this
bill. As a result, a variety of critical programs are underfunded.   The
only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to offset
discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The PresidentD,s
FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that
conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings in mandatory
and other programs available to help finance this spending.  In the
Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis --
took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs together with mandatory offsets.  In addition, this year, as in
the past, such mandatory offsets have been approved by the House and
Senate in other appropriations bills.  The Administration urges the
Congress to consider such mandatory savings proposals for other priority
discretionary programs, including those funded through this bill.

        The Administration is concerned that both versions of the bill
could seriously disrupt air transportation safety and vital Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) and Coast Guard modernization programs,
compromise highway safety, and delay AmtrakD,s progress towards operating
self-sufficiency. The conferees could accommodate some of the funding
increases recommended below by adhering more closely to the Presidentu,s
request for the Airport Grants program, High Speed Rail, Coast Guard
Alteration of Bridges, and other programs.  Both the House and the Senate
versions of the bill also include some objectionable language provisions.

        The AdministrationD,s specific concerns with both the House and
Senate versions of the bill are discussed below.

Essential Operations

        The Administration strongly urges the conferees to fully fund the
request for Coast Guard and FAA operations. The House has funded Coast
Guard Operating Expenses at $72 million below the requested level and
reallocated funds among programs. The House version would force the Coast
Guard to lay up certain cutters and aircraft and decommission one of the


NationD,s three polar icebreakers, thereby compromising the integrity of
our Exclusive Economic Zone and leaving critically depleted fish stocks
under-protected. The Senate level of $2,762 million would better enable
the Coast Guard to carry out its many important missions.

        Likewise, we ask the conferees to restore funding for FAA
Operations. The House version is $56 million below the requested level,
the Senate version $50 million below. The full requested level of $5,631
million is needed to ensure that the FAA can continue to provide current
service and can hire the security personnel and safety inspectors needed
to meet the demands of increased air travel.  The Administration also
objects to Senate earmarks for low priority programs, such as subsidies
for contract towers that are not cost-beneficial.

Coast Guard and FAA Modernization

        The Administration urges the conferees to fully fund the request
for Coast Guard and FAA modernization to ensure that the equipment and
infrastructure necessary to fulfill critical missions in the future are
available. The Administration is particularly concerned about language in
the Senate version intended to limit outlays for FAA Facilities and
Equipment. We question whether this provision can be implemented and are
concerned about its detrimental programmatic effects.

        Funding below the requested level for the FAAD,s capital program
could delay National Airspace System Modernization.   In particular, we
urge full funding of the Host Computer replacement and other Year 2000
conversion activities.   The conferees also are encouraged to restore
funding for the Flight 2000 program, eliminated by the House and virtually
eliminated by the Senate.   This program is a key element of the FAAC:, s
plans for a transition to a more efficient, user-involved, satellite-based
air traffic control system to meet the air traffic needs of the next
century. The conferees are requested to fund the $100 million for
explosive detection systems from the FAA Facilities and Equipment account,
not the Airport Improvement Program account, to ensure these critical
systems are actually purchased and then deployed where they are most
needed.

        The Administration requests that the conferees fund the Coast
Guard Acquisition, Construction, and Improvements account at the requested
level of $443 million and refrain from directing funds to unrequested
projects that increase operating costs.  The mix of projects requested in
the PresidentD,s budget will reduce the Coast GuardD,s future operating
costs, improve mission performance, and upgrade facilities and housing for
Coast Guard personnel. The reductions of $54 million made by the House
and $17 million made by the Senate would have harmful long-term effects on
the Coast GuardD,s capability. We also urge the conferees to fully fund
the PresidentD,s request for the Nationwide Global Positioning System and
for adding a second civil signal to the Global Positioning System.

Amtrak Capital Grants

        The Administration strongly encourages the conferees to adopt the
House funding level of $609 million for Amtrak capital grants and the
Senate provision that would allow Amtrak to invest these capital funds
flexibly, as is presently done by Federal Transit Administration
grantees. Amtrak is an essential component of the NationD,s inter-city
transportation system, and it needs both adequate funding and flexibility
to carry through on the bipartisan, five-year reform plan envisioned by
the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. Also, neither the House


nor the Senate has provided the requested $12 million to complete the
Federal contribution to the renovation of Penn Station.

Project Labor Agreements

        An acceptable compromise was reached between the Administration
and the Senate on Section 322 of the Senate-passed bill. The
Administration understands that there may be attempts to unravel this
agreement.  If the conference bill includes different language than the
Senate-passed bill, it could jeopardize enactment of the bill. We
strongly urge the conferees to retain the Senate language.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration

        To protect the safety of automobile travelers adequately, the
Administration asks that the conferees work with the authorizing
committees and provide an additional $12 million for high-priority
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration programs. These vehicle
safety and consumer information activities are essential to providing
consumers with up-to-date safety information, conducting critical research
on advanced air bag systems and the biomechanics of injury, and developing
improved crash test dummies.

Access-to-Jobs

        The Administration requests that the conferees provide an
additional $50 million to fully fund the PresidentD,s request of $100
million for the Access-to-Jobs program.  This program is an important
component of the AdministrationD,s welfare reform effort.  The additional
resources are essential to helping more individuals in communities around
the country make a successful transition from welfare to work.

Office of the Secretary and civil Rights

        The Administration urges the conferees to provide the PresidentD,s
requested $62 million for the Office of the Secretary and to drop the new
account structures and limitations on political appointees contained in
both versions of the bill.  These provisions would undermine the
SecretaryD,s ability to manage the Department effectively by, among other
things, causing a reduction-in-force.  The Administration is also greatly
concerned about the SenateD,s 20-percent reduction to the funding request
for the Office of civil Rights, a level that is below FY 1998. This
reduction would significantly hamper the DepartmentD,s ability to enforce
laws that prohibit discrimination in Federally operated or assisted
transportation programs.

        The provision in both the House and Senate versions of the bill
that requires congressional approval of assessments to be levied by the
Transportation Administrative Service Center on other departmental
entities constitutes a legislative veto.  The Administration will
interpret this provision to require notification only, since any other
interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court ruling in INS vs. Chadha.

Earmarks

        The Senate bill earmarks nearly 400 transit projects, the House
bill nearly 300.  In addition, both versions earmark many airport,
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), and rail projects.  Consistent
with our objections to TEA-21, the Administration believes that projects
should be funded based upon their merit and that funds should not be


directed to low-priority projects that cannot meet established selection
criteria.

Language Provisions

        The Administration strongly opposes section 341 of the Senate
bill, which would allow helicopters to operate and land on Federally-owned
lands in Alaska, including wilderness areas.  This would be harmful to
species and habitat and disrupt CongressD, carefully crafted balance on
this issue in the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act
(ANILCA). Under ANILCA, helicopter landings are permitted for emergency
reasons and, on a case-by-case basis, for non-emergency use in
non-wilderness areas.  The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture
have previously recommended that bills containing similar provisions be
vetoed.

        The Administration requests that the conferees delete the language
in both versions of the bill that would prohibit the Coast Guard and the
FAA from evaluating options for collecting fees for their services.   User
fees may be a critical means in the future for ensuring that the Coast
Guard and the FAA have adequate resources to meet their operating and
capital needs without significantly reducing other vital transportation
programs.

        The Administration is concerned that language in the Senate bill
prohibiting obligation of funds for the FAA's Wide Area Augmentation
System (WAAS) until it is certified as a sole means of navigation would
suspend the WAAS program prematurely.  The Administration appreciates the
Senate's concerns but believes that these concerns relate more to Phases
II and III of the WAAS program than to Phase I.  It does not make sense to
forego the substantial benefits of WAAS Phase I now that they are so close
to being achieved. The Administration requests that the conferees either
eliminate the Senate language or amend it to prohibit obligation of funds
for WAAS Phases II and III prior to the requested certifications.

        The Administration is pleased that the House recognizes the need
to review the Coast GuardD,s roles and missions but objects to its
proposed panel. This proposal would add significant administrative and
procedural requirements to the process and delay the Deepwater contract by
at least a year.  The AdministrationD,s advisory council would provide an
objective, third-party assessment of the Coast GuardD,s roles and missions
in a time frame consistent with the planned Deepwater procurement.

        The Administration strongly objects to the House billD,s
prohibition of any future changes to automobile fuel economy (CAFE)
standards. This significant policy issue should be addressed analytically
through the process in place under Federal law and not preemptively
settled through the appropriations process.

        The Administration urges deletion of the Senate provision
pertaining to expedited supreme Court review of decisions concerning the
DepartmentD,s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise programs as this provision
would disrupt and delay pending court cases and send the wrong kind of
cases directly to the Supreme Court.

        Finally, the Administration objects to the language in the Senate
version of the bill that directs the National Transportation Safety Board
to reimburse the State of New York for both extraordinary and routine
costs associated with the crash of TWA 800. The Administration believes
that the State and local counties of New York should be reimbursed only


 for extraordinary expenses incurred as a result of the crash. They should
 not receive a windfall by being reimbursed for routine activities that
 would have occurred absent the crash.

         We look forward to working with the conferees to address our
 mutual concerns.

                                                 Sincerely,




                                                 Jacob J. Lew
                                                 Director

 Identical Letter Sent to The Honorable Bob Livingston,
 The Honorable David R. Obey, The Honorable Frank R. Wolf,
 The Honorable Martin O. Sabo, The Honorable Ted Stevens,
 The Honorable Robert C. Byrd, The Honorable Richard C. Shelby,
 and The Honorable Frank R. Lautenberg
