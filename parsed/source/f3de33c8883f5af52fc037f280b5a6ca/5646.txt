Smoking Foes Split as Factions Oppose Industry Immunity
                 Health: As congressional battle looms, groups struggle
over how to gain
              passage of proposed $368.5-billion settlement. Fissure may
threaten the deal,
              some say.
              By HENRY WEINSTEIN, MYRON LEVIN, Times Staff Writers




                              n the eve of a high-stakes struggle in Congress
over
                              sweeping regulation of the nation's cigarette
companies, the
                       tobacco-control movement is badly fractured, beset by
                       philosophical differences, personal animosities and
tactical
                       disagreements.
                            Reflecting the deep divide in the anti-smoking
movement, critics
                       of a proposed national tobacco settlement have
organized a new
                       coalition to challenge rival groups that are willing
to grant legal
                       protections to cigarette makers in exchange for
public health
                       gains--the quid pro quo at the heart of the proposed
$368.5-billion
                       national tobacco settlement.
                            The new coalition, called Save Lives, Not
Tobacco, is expected
                       to urge Congress to pass sweeping anti-smoking legi
slation without
                       granting the industry its cherished goal of immunity


from the most
          ,           threatening types of lawsuits.
                           The group's formation, to be announced in
coming weeks,
                       underscores the bitter ideological debate and
personal hostilities that
                       have festered within anti-smoking ranks over whether
it is necessary
                       to cut a deal with cigarette makers to achieve
public health goals.
                       The split is likely to further complicate the
already thorny task of
                       moving major tobacco legislation through Congress
next year.
                            The more militant health and consumer groups,
such as the
                       American Lung Assn. and Ralph Nader's Public
Citizen, oppose
                       any special legal protections for tobacco firms,
including restrictions
                       on class-action lawsuits or limitations on punitive
damages. They
                       maintain that the civil justice system should not be
changed for the
                       sake of one interest group, especially a rogue
industry such as
                       tobacco, which has been linked to the deaths of
400,000
                      Americans a year.
                            Tobacco companies "shou~d get no
protection--nothing," said
                      Bill Godshall, director of SmokeFree Pennsylvania.
"The tobacco
                      industry should be treated like every other
corporation."
                            Moreover, Godshall and other activists contend
that accepting
                      any restrictions on lawsuits that could lead to huge
damage awards
                      against the tobacco industry would eliminate the
strongest deterrent
                      to industry misconduct and consequently undermine
public health
                      goals.
                            Their more moderate counterparts, such as the
American
                      Cancer Society and the National Center for Tobacco
Free Kids,
                      regard such legal protections for cigarette makers
as a necessary
                      evil. Banded together in a coalition called
Effective National Action
                      to Control Tobacco, or ENACT, they generally believe
sweeping
                      anti-smoking measures will never be passed unless
the industry gets
                      something in return.
                            The industry's primary goal in federal
legislation is securing limits
                      on its legal exposure, which is massive and growing


weekly.
                            In the past, when anti-tobacco forces had
little prospect of
                       moving strong legislation through Congress, their
periodic
                       internecine warfare seemed largely academic. But now
that the
                       industry is anxious to buy peace, the stakes and the
costs of disunity
                       could be much higher.
                            "I think it's a terribly serious problem, and
it's gotten worse in
                       recent months," said Michael Pertschuk, who has
battled the
                       industry for three decades and headed the Federal
Trade
                       Commission during the Carter administration.   "The
bitterness is
                       running so deep it is difficult to imagine
coordination." The groups
                       have virtually identical goals but are seriously
split on tactics, said
                       Pertschuk, who philosophically is closer to ENACT.
                            Mitchell Zeller, associate commissioner of the·
Food and Drug
                       Administration and a longtime industry foe, said at
a recent
                       conference in San Francisco that the fissures might
make it
                       impossible to enact effective anti-tobacco
legislation.
                            In an attempt to heal the rupture, former
surgeon General C.
                       Everett Koop held a meeting in Washington last week
to seek a
                       consensus between representatives of ENACT and Save
Lives.
                       However, the meeting broke up after about 90
minutes, with the
                       groups still divided on the "immunity issue,"
according to sources at
                       the gathering.
                            The clash has become so divisive that Godshall,
a Save Lives
                       organizer, has compared Matt Myers, an ENACT leader,
to
                       Neville Chamberlain, the 1930s British prime
minister who naively
                       attempted to appease Hitler. Myers declined comment.
                            In turn, another ENACT leader, Linda Crawford,
derided the
                       militants as "tree huggers," likening them to
environmental
                       extremists.
                            Both coalitions advocate tough anti-smoking
legislation, including
                       unfettered regulatory authority for the FDA, major
advertising
                       restrictions, steep tax hikes on cigarettes and
disclosure of internal


                       industry research on the health hazards of smoking.
                            But their split on the immunity issue reflects
sharply differing
                       perceptions of how far the pendulum has swung
against Big
                       Tobacco.
                            The militants contend that the pendulum will
continue to swing
                       against the industry, which can be brought under
control without any
                       major concessions. The so-called moderates, many of
whom are in
                       fact steadfast liberals, believe that the cigarette
companies,
                       weakened though they are, could still kill a bill
that would cost them
                       billions and give them nothing in return.
                             In some ways, the clash parallels those within
the
                       $50-billion-a-year tobacco industry, whose members
ordinarily
                       present a united front in public relations, lobbying
and litigation but
                       aggressively compete for sales and have had internal
disputes about
                       elements of the settlement.

                            Beltway Insiders vs. Grass-Roots Skeptics
                            The differences between the two anti-smoking
camps involve
                       style as well as substance. With some exceptions,
the ENACT
                       groups are more established and well-funded, with
strong
                       Washington ties, whereas their critics are more
ideological,
                       grass-roots oriented and,   in many instances, deeply
skeptical that
                       anything good can come out of Washington.
                            In addition to the American Cancer Society and
Tobacco Free
                       Kids, ENACT's member organizations include the
American Heart
                       Assn., the American Medical Assn., the American
Academy of
                       Family Physicians, the American College of' Chest
Physicians and
                       the Children's Defense Fund.
                            Besides the Lung Assn. and Public Citizen, Save
Lives'
                       members include Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, the
American
                       Council on Science and Health,   the American Public
Health Assn.,
                       a bevy of local anti-tobacco groups, including
Californians Against
                       Death by Tobacco, UC San Francisco Medical School
professor
                       and author Stanton Glantz, and Minnesota Atty. Gen.
Hubert H.


                       Humphrey III.
                           Both sides, in what one observer called "the
battle of the white
                       hats," include individuals who have been fighting
the industry for
                       years.
                            The new coalition also includes litigants who
were excluded from
                       the proposed tobacco settlement announced in June.
One member
                       is the Coalition for Workers' Health Care FUnds,
which represents
                       employee insurance programs that have filed lawsuits
in 26 states
                       seeking to make tobacco companies reimburse billions
of dollars in
                       smoking-related health care costs.
                           While the proposed tobacco deal would provide
billions in
                       health care reimbursement to states, its ban on
class-action suits,
                       and any other type of aggregated claims, could
prevent the
                       employee health care programs from pursuing their
                                                                ,
cases.
                            This is hardly the first dispute among
anti-smoking activists. They
                      have often been a fractious bunch, prone to
squabbling over
                      strategy and to jealous anxiety over who gets credit
for what. They
                      sometimes seem angrier at each other than at the
tobacco
                      companies, reminiscent of bitter divisions that
beset the antiwar
                      movement in the late 1960s.
                           Many of the personal salvos this' year have been
lobbed at
                      Myers, executive director of the National Center for
Tobacco Free
                      Kids, a group founded two years ago with a
multimillion-dollar
                      grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

                              Negotiating Tactics Sparked Disagreement
                              The attacks began when it came to light in
April that Myers, an
                       attorney and veteran anti-tobacco lobbyist, was the
only movement
                       representative participating in the negotiations
that led to the
                       massive settlement between the industry, 39 state
attorneys general
                       and plaintiffs lawyers.
                            Myers was instrumental in extracting many of
the public health
                       concessions in the deal. Since then, he has
acknowledged that
                       certain aspects of the settlement need
strengthening-~particularly


                         provisions limiting the power of the FDA to regulate
the cigarette
                         companies.
                             Nonetheless, he has been chastised by some
erstwhile allies.
                         Some members of Save Lives have maintained since the
spring that
                         there was no need to negotiate because their side
ultimately would
                         prevail as a result of future legal victories.
                             Myers declined comment on the personal attacks.
Rather, he
                         said,    "I think diversity of opinion among public
health groups has
                         been constructive and beneficial. However, to the
extent the public
                         health community sees each other as the enemy rather
than the
                         tobacco industry        . it could weaken the voice of
our entire
                         community."
                             Richard Daynard, founder of Northeastern Law
School's
                         Tobacco Products Liability Project, said he too
would prefer unity.
                         But, he said, Save Lives' stance against sacrificing
legal rights is
                         fundamental and inextricably linked to health
because much of the
                         damaging information about the tobacco industry has
emerged as a
                         result of litigation.
                              "Lawsuits against the tobacco industry
currently are the
                         preeminent public health measure," Daynard
maintained.
                                 The debate among the activists over legal
concessions to the
                         industry has intensified in recent weeks.
                              Under the settlement, tobacco firms would pay
$368.S billion
                         over the next 2S'years to reimburse states for money
spent treating
                         sick smokers, as well as funding smoking cessation
programs and
                         anti-smoking advertising campaigns. Sharp limits
would be imposed
                         on tobacco advertising and marketing, including a
ban on billboards
                         and merchandise with tobacco logos, and the
companies would
                         have to terminate their sponsorship of sporting and
cultural events.
                                 In return, the industry would get a ban on
lawsuits by the states
                         and class-action claims, as well as prohibition of
punitive damages
                         in suits by individual smokers and a $S-billion
annual cap on
                         litigation damages.


                              since cigarette makers have had remarkable
success in the
                         courts--and no one yet has won punitive
damages--supporters of
                         the deal, led by Mississippi Atty. Gen. Mike Moore,
consider the
                         concession worth making.
                              However, the settlement would require new
federal statutes to
                         limit the type and scope of lawsuits against tobacco
firms.
                              In an attempt to come to grips with that realit
y, the American
                         Cancer Society commissioned Hogan & Hartson, a
Washington
                      law firm, to review the settlement. That
inadvertently led to one of
                      the most ferocious skirmishes in the war of the
anti-tobacco groups.

                              In July, the ACS leaders declared that the
settlement was
                         fundamentally flawed. To buttress its position, the
ACS
                         disseminated a stinging critique of how the deal
would severely
                      curtail the ability of the FDA to regulate the
tobacco industry and in
                      particular to reduce the nicotine content of
cigarettes.
                            Later in the summer, the society sent to all
members of Congress
                      a lengthy analysis of several constitutional issues
raised by the
                      settlement. The analysis was prepared by Hogan &
Hartson.
                            The study told members of Congress there are
three possible
                      ways it could restrict litigation against tobacco
companies without
                      running afoul of the Constitution. Among the memo's
options:
                      Congress could enact legislation compelling states
to pass laws
                      barring class-action lawsuit.s against tobacco
companies and
                      prohibiting punitive damages in order to qualify for
federal funds.
                            For many weeks, the memo drew little notice.
Then it came to
                      Godshall's attention, and he lobbed a verbal

                      anti-tobacco activists, contending that the ACS had
come out in
                      favor of "preempting" state laws.

                              Cancer Society Against 'preemption'
                              In the tobacco-control world, "preemption" is a
fighting word.
                         Historically, it has connoted efforts by Big Tobacco


to prevent
                        states and localities from passing laws that are
tougher than those
                        enacted by the federal government.
                             The American Cancer Society memo stated flatly
that it
                        opposed preemption of any state or local
tobacco-control laws,
                        such as those prohibiting smoking in restaurants.
                             "We're not for preemption. We want more state
and local
                        policies to keep the pressure up on the tobacco
companies,"
                        Crawford said in an interview.
                             Godshall retorted that neither Crawford nor any
other ACS
                        official had disowned the memo or come out against
giving the
                        industry any special legal protections.
                             "Why are we fighting among ourselves?,"
Crawford lamented.
                        "We're not a legal group. Public health is our
primary concern."
                            But Daynard said Crawford's position failed to
address the link
                        between litigation and public health. He derided the
memo as a
                        "cookbook on how to cut off the legal rights of
cancer victims."
                            Late last week, another nasty skirmish indicati
ve of the deep
                        distrust erupted when ENACT released polling data
saying
                        residents of four states--Colorado, Michigan, Ohio,
Oklahoma--all
                        favored swift congressional action on comprehensive
tobacco
                        legislation.
                             Two Save Lives members--Action on Smoking and
Health and
                        the Workers Health group--immediately issued press
releases
                        saying that the pollsters failed to give relevant
information to survey
                        respondents in an effort to skew the results. ENACT
spokesmen
                        retorted that the detractors based their criticism
on a draft question
                       which was not asked.
                            Still, there was a potentially significant
development at mid-week
                       that could move the two camps closer together.
                            After considerable debate in Dallas, the
policymaking delegate.
                       body of the American Medical Assn., a key ENACT
member,
                       approved a resolution opposing any civil immunity
"or any other
                       special legal advantages" for the tobacco industry.
                            At the meeting, the delegates voted against

accepting an AMA
                        task force report on immunity that would have given
the
                        organization wiggle room to endorse legislation to
give cigarette
                        companies such legal protections.   "The delegates
told us:    'Not over
                        our dead bodies' would they accept immunity," said
AMA trustee
                        Dr. John C. Nelson.
                             The AMA vote followed a recent decision by Koop
to spurn a
                        request that he become the titular head of ENACT. A
Koop aide
                      said his staunch opposition to affording the
industry any special legal
                      protection played a role in his choice.
                           As time has passed, the militants have gained
strength, aided in
                      part by further damaging revelations about the
industry and in no
                      small part by industry miscues--in particular the
attempt to sneak a
                      $50 billion tax break for the cigarette companies
into an
                      appropriations bill last summer.
                           The House and Senate are expected to consider
half a dozen or
                      more tobacco bills--some of which include special 1
egal protections
                      for the industry and others that don't.
