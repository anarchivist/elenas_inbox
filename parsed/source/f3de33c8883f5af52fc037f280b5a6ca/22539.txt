                            DATE:           February 1,1999
                            LOCATION: Grand Hyatt Hotel
                            BRIEFING TIME: 4:00pm - 4:20pm
                            EVENT TIME:     4:30pm - 5:30pm
                            FROM:           Bruce Reed, Ben Johnson


I.    PURPOSE

      To build support for your education initiatives and education budget, and to thank the
      National School Boards Association for their efforts in fostering excellence in public
      elementary and secondary education.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be addressing approximately 800 participants in the National School Board
      Associations' Annual Federal Relations Network Conference. The audience will include
      NSBA leaders and approximately 700 local school board members from every
      congressional district The theme for the conference is "The Federal Role: Collaboration
      for Student Achievement". The Federal Relations Network Conference began on
      Sunday, January 31, and will end tomorrow, Tuesday, February 2, with participants
      spending the day on Capitol Hill meeting their representatives and senators. NSBA and
      its Federation members represent the nation's 95,000 local school board members.

      NSBA has been a strong supporter of all of your education initiatives of the past 6 years,
      and has worked closely with the Administration to secure their enactment. . The
      participants in this Federal Relations Network Conference will be focused primarily on
      the upcoming reauthorization of ESE A, and on education appropriations. As they
      approach ESEA reauthorization, they will be generally supportive of the substantive
      direction of your accountability proposals, though concerned that they be given adequate
      flexibility to implement them. They will push generally for greater local flexibility in
      federal education programs, though they have also opposed block grant proposals in the
      past. They are staunchly opposed to the voucher proposals the Republicans are expected
      to offer.
