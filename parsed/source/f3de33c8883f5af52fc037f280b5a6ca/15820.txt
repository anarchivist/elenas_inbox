Welfare Reform and Congressional Action on the Bipartisan Budget Agreement

Question:   Is Congress following the budget agreement in their actions to implement
            legislation to date?

Answer:     No. I strongly oppose the House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal,
            which violates the bipartisan budget agreement, treats disabled legal immigrants
            unfairly, and prevents working welfare recipients from getting a minimum wage.

            On the other hand, I am very pleased that the Ways and Means Subcommittee $3
            billion welfare-to-work proposal meets many of my priorities. These include:
            targeting funds to areas and individuals with high needs, directing funds to cities
            and local governments, awarding some funds competitively, and allowing
            communities to create successful job placement and creation programs.

            But the provisions of the Subcommittee proposal addressing legal immigrants and
            the minimum wage are clearly unacceptable.

Question:   Why do you oppose House efforts to restore benefits to legal Immigrants?

Answer:     The Ways and Means Subcommittee's proposed amendment to the welfare law
            clearly violates the negotiated, bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a
            minimal safety net for disabled legal immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal
            would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits only to immigrants already receiving
            benefits prior to August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan budget agreement
            policy restores SSI and Medicaid benefits to any immigrant in the country as of
            that date who is or becomes disabled.

            The Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal would protect 75,000 fewer
            immigrants than the budget agreement by the year 2002. And in leaving
            unprotected any person who becomes disabled after August 22, 1996, it fails to
            target assistance to the most vulnerable individuals.

Question:   Why do you oppose House action on paying the minimum wage to workfare
            recipients?

Answer:     I strongly oppose the Ways and Means Subcommittee's provision on the
            minimum wage, which undermines the fundamental goals of welfare reform.

            I strongly believe that everyone who can work must work -- and that those who
            work should earn the minimum wage, whether they are coming off of welfare or
            not. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee proposal does not meet this test.
             It effectively creates a subminimum wage for workfare participants. And it
            weakens the welfare law's work requirements.

Welfare Caseload

Question:    You have bragged about the fact that welfare caseloads have declined by 20
             percent in the last four years. If the welfare rolls were declining before the
             new welfare law, why did you need to sign it?

Answer:      The caseload reductions show why I signed the welfare law -- they're the best
             evidence that welfare refonn works. As you know, this Administration granted
             welfare refonn waivers to 43 states so they could impose tough work
             requirements and time limits and provide incentives that made work pay better
             than welfare. The 20 percent decline in welfare caseloads since January 1993
             shows that these kinds of actions work. With the new law, governors can expand
             these welfare refonn actions without having to petition Washington.

             A recent study by my Council of Economic Advisors showed that, while 40% of
             the decline in the welfare caseload is due to the strong economy we have, about a
             third is due to the welfare waivers my Administration granted to 43 states prior to
             the signing of the welfare law.

Welfare Privatization
Question:    You recently denied Texas' request to privatize its welfare programs.
             Doesn't your decision contradict the welfare reform law which grants states
             the flexibility to run their own programs?

Answer:      No. Based on the new welfare law, Texas already has the authority to proceed
             now with the welfare portion of their proposal. However, Congress retained the
             laws on Medicaid and food stamps. Our guidance to Texas is consistent with
             current law.
