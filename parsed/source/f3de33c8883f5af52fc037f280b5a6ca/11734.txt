TEXT:
I have received a letter from the California Congress of Parents,
Teachers, and Students requesting a POTUS video for the100th CA State PTA
Convention.  It is being held in Sacramento May 4-7, and they are
expecting 4,000 delegates from allover the state.

Are we in support?   Do you want me to submit a scheduling proposal?
