BR/EK:

Attached please find a draft 2-pager on the announcement and some q&a for
review.



Also, here are a couple of points to contemplate in the morning.

1. On the RCPIs.   Technically, we have 30 RCPls, but 5 are in some sort
of probationary status and may not get funding next year if they don't
improve their performance. Based on that, do want to say 25 or 30 in our
paper and speech.   I don't think DOJ feels strongly, but we should be
consistent.

2. On civil rights enforcement. Ricki and DOJ thought it was important
to add language on how DOJ has prosecuted some 300 cops to date.  I told
her that I don't agree, but that Chuck and others may feel differently in
the morning.  I imagine this may come up in the brief. Below is some
language she suggested.

"Since 1993, the Justice Department has criminally prosecuted more than
300 law enforcement officers who have engaged in misconduct -- resulting
in over 200 convictions.  In addition, using the authority given to them
under the 1994 Crime Act, the Department has begun investigating the
patterns and practices of a handful of law enforcement agencies across the
country, which my lead to changes in the way police departments operate
so the problems of the past are not the problems of the future."

3.   On the CBC.   BR: I connected w/Broderick as you suggested about a


meeting next week, and he informed me that: (1) several members had
already been invited and were attending the radio address; and (2) the
proposed meeting may be taking place tomorrow after the radio address.
Broderick may have it wrong, but you may want to confirm at senior staff.

4. On press.   I'm a bit concerned about what my have been communicated to
the groups about press.   I told my guys we weren't expecting them to go
out to the stakeout, and that we didn't want any of the guests scooping
the President on this important topic.   However, Hugh Price's office
called me about arranging for camera coverage, organizing a stakeout, and
generally maximizing press coverage.   I told them that we could not break
the radio address embargo, so meeting participants would probably need to
settle for embargoed statements until tomorrow -- but that Hugh and Chuck
should have had a conversation about this ... go figure? Also, Nechis has
been eager to get our paper and pitch this to the nets.   Do we want
someone like Eric on camera? Or do we want the President's words to speak
for themselves? And, are we pitching meeting participants for the shows?

S.  Boston factoid.  BR:   I sent you and Jordan an article that, I
believe, pretty much confirms that complains are down in Boston.    I
couldn't get actual numbers though.

                                 Strengthening Police Integrity
                                        March 13, 1999


In his radio address to the nation, the President will take several steps to help strengthen the
integrity and ethics of police forces across the country. He will propose that the 21 st Century
Policing Initiative he will soon send to Congress include: (1) a $42 million increase in funding
for state and local police training, education, and recruitment; and (2) $5 million in new funds to
establish citizen police academies that engage community residents in the fight against crime.
The President also will call on the Attorney General to convene a series of meetings with
community and law enforcement leaders to further discuss and make joint recommendations on
these issues.              .

Investing in Better Policing

       $20 million to expand police integrity and ethics training. While most police officers
       are extensively screened and trained before their first day on the job, police today face
       more difficult and demanding situations than ever before. To help ensure that they are
       well-trained and prepared to meet these challenges, the Justice Department's Office of
       Community Oriented Policing (COPS) has established 25 Regional Community Policing
       Institutes (RCPIs) throughout the country. To date, the RCPIs have trained more than
       10,000 law enforcement officials and community members in a variety of disciplines, and
       two of the RCPIs specialize in the area of police integrity and ethics. To expand the
       availability of this crucial training, the President's 21 st Century Policing Initiative will
       propose a $20 million increase in funding to make police integrity training available at all
       25 RCPIs.

       $20 million to promote the best educated police force possible. Like all Americans,
       police officers deserve access to the best education possible to meet the complex
       demands of their job. That is why the President's 21st Century Policing Initiative will
       include $20 million in new funds to help make college scholarships available to our
       police officers. The President's crime bill will also reauthorize the Police Corps, which
       offers young people college scholarships in return for their service as law enforcement
       officers. Since its creation in the 1994 Crime Act, the Police Corps has provided $90
       million in college scholarships to police recruits in 23 states.

       $2 million for improved minority recruitment. As we work to better educate and train
       our police, we must also do more to make sure police departments reflect the diversity of
       the communities they represent. Last year, the COPS Office awarded $1 million to
       community organizations to develop targeted police recruitment efforts, including the
       establishment of police magnet high school programs and partnerships with local
       colleges. The President's 21st Century Policing Initiative will propose doubling the
       funds available for such innovative outreach and recruitment initiatives.

Engaging the Community

      $5 million to establish citizen police academies.      Some police departments have
      established citizen police academies to train neighborhood residents on police procedures,
      and to improve understanding of how police make important decisions (i.e., when and
      what level offorce to use when apprehending a suspect). But citizen academies can do
      much more. They can also help police learn about the concerns of citizens, and they can
      be used to train residents in collaborative problem-solving -- making them full partners in
      community policing and crime prevention efforts. The President's crime bill will
      propose $5 million to establish more citizen police academies around the country.

Enforcing the Law

      Prosecuting serious misconduct and abuse. Although the vast majority of police
      officers enforce our laws in a way that is both vigorous and fair, those who break the law
      must be brought to justice. We cannot allow a few corrupt or abusive police officers to
      undermine the progress that hundreds of thousands of police officers have worked so hard
      to achieve. That is why, at any given time, the Justice Department is investigating
      hundreds of allegations of criminal misconduct and abuse by police. To ensure that
      federal prosecutors have the resources they need to enforce our laws in these cases, the
      President's FY 2000 budget includes an increase of over $1 million for this purpose.

Continuing the Community Policing Revolution

      The President's 21st Century Policing Initiative. To make our communities safer and
      stronger, we must extend our commitmerit to community policing into the 21 st Century.
      The President's 21 st Century Policing Initiative will do that by: helping communities hire
      up to 50,000 more community police officers; giving law enforcement access to the latest
      crime-fighting technologies; and engaging the entire community -- from prosecutors, to
      school officials, to leaders from the faith community -- in the fight against crime.

      Finishing the job of putting 100,000 more community police on the street. To date,
      the President's COPS program has helped cities to hire or redeploy more than 92,000
      officers, and increased the number oflaw enforcement agencies engaged in community
      policing from hundreds to over 11,000 today. Through COPS, community policing has
      spread throughout the country and helped drive down the crime rates for all of our people.

Forming New Partnerships

      Working together to find new solutions. The President will ask the Attorney General
      to sponsor a series of meetings and discussions with law enforcement and community
      leaders to consider additional joint recommendations and further steps that can be taken
      to strengthen police integrity -- and to make sure the criminal justice system serves the
      needs of all Americans.

                              Police Integrity Radio Address
                                  Questions and Answers
                                      March 13, 1999


Q:   What more can you tell us about the policies you are announcing today?

A:   The policies announced today will be contained in the President's 21st Century Policing
     Initiative, which will soon be sent to the Congress as part of a larger crime bill.. They
     are:

     (1) Integrity and ethics training. Currently, the COPS Office provides about $40
     million to assist in the training of state and local law enforcement, including $24 million
     for some 25 Regional Community Policing Institutes (RCPIs). The President's crime
     bill will provide an increase of $20 million to so that all of our RCPIs will be able to
     provide police integrity and ethics training. Currently, only two of the centers specialize
     in this crucial training.

     (2) Education assistance for police. The President's crime bill will authorize a new
     $20 million scholarship program for current state and local police officers. This will
     provide needed assistance to officers already on the force, who are seeking to advance
     their education and skills. It also builds on the Police Corps program, which offers
     college scholarships in exchange for service in law enforcement -- and which will also be
     extended in the President's bill.

     (3) Improved minority recruitment. The President's bill will provide a $1 million
     increase for targeted police recruitment and outreach efforts. Last year, we
     provided $1 million for innovative recruitment strategies to community
     organizations in New York, Los Angeles, and Memphis. The grant to New York,
     for example, involves a partnership between East Brooklyn Congregations and
     CUNY/John Jay College where they are developing a police magnet high school for
     youth, as well as evening programs for adults in the largely Hispanic and African
     American neighborhoods of East Brooklyn, New York.

     (4) More citizen police academies. The President's crime bill will also propose $5
     million to establish more citizen police academies around the country. In addition to
     instructing residents on important police procedures, these academies can also help to
     teach residents problem-solving skills that will help them address their local crime
     problems. The citizen academies are part of an overall effort within the President's new
     policing initiative to engage all sectors ofthe community to come together to fight crime.

     All of the policies announced today are fully funded in our FY 2000 budget.

Q:   New York City has hired thousands of officers with COPS funds. As a result,
     they've put more police on their streets who in turn have engaged in more
     aggressive policing tactics. In view of the Diallo shooting, how can you say that
     your COPS initiative is part of the solution to police brutality and misconduct?

A:   Many cities have hired hundreds of law enforcement officers through COPS and have not
     had similar problems. For instance, large cities such as San Diego and Boston have
     significantly increased the size of their police forces. through COPS without increasing
     the number of citizen complaints of police misconduct. In fact, citizen satisfaction with
     the police has increased in these and other cities.

     Another good example is in nearby Prince George's County. In P.G. county, they have
     increased their police force, substantially increased traffic and investigative stops, while
     at the same time dramatically decreasing citizen complaints: excessive force complaints
     are down by half, and officerlcitizen contacts that result in citizen injury are down by 70
     percent compared to 1995.


Q:   The President announced that the Attorney General would be convening a series of
     meetings with law enforcement and community leaders. Who will be involved in
     these meetings and what do you expect will come out of these meetings?

A:   The meetings will bring together police chiefs, representatives of rank and file police
     officers, and experts on police practices, along with civil rights and other community
     leaders who know the concerns of the community regarding police misconduct. The
     purpose would be to discuss the best practices for preventing misconduct and excessive
     use of force, develop recommendations for additional actions, and build greater trust
     between the police and the communities they serve.


Q:   The tragic shooting death of Amadou Diallo by members of the New York Police
     Department has focused the Nation's attention on the problem of police brutality. Is the
     federal government investigating that matter?

A:   The FBI, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Justice
     Department's Civil Rights Division have been working closely and actively with the
     Bronx District Attorney's Office on the investigation. They are not just monitoring this
     case while the DA handles the investigation -- Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney, is
     personally involved in supervising the federal role in the investigation.


Q:   Is the Justice Department investigating the entire New York Police Department?

A:   After the incident involving the beating of Abner Louima, the U.S. Attorney for the
                      TIcx-Dump Conversion

     Eastern District of New York, Zachary Carter, began a preliminary inquiry to determine
     whether the Justice Department should invoke its pattern or practice authority against the
     New York Police Department. This inquiry is ongoing. The Department is now
     coordinating its efforts with the Civil Rights Division, and the United States Attorneys
     Offices for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, to examine other aspects of
     the New York Police Department in light of the issues raised by the Diallo shooting.


Q:   What is the Justice Department's pattern or practice authority?

A:   Under the President's 1994 Crime Act, the Justice Department has the authority to file
     civil suits against police departments that engage in a pattern of police misconduct. Using
     that authority, the Department is currently investigating a handful oflaw enforcement
     agencies across the country. Those investigations may result in court orders or
     settlements requiring police departments to change the way they operate - so the
     problems of the past are not the problems of the future.


Q:   Is that what the Justice Department is doing with the New Jersey State Police?

A:   Yes. The Justice Department is actively reviewing the New Jersey State Police to
     determine whether state troopers have engaged in a pattern of practice of discriminatory
     traffic stops.


Q:   What can the Justice Department do against individual police officers who engage
     in misconduct?

A:   The Justice Department has the authority under criminal law to prosecute law
     enforcement officers who engage in misconduct, including the use of excessive force. At
     any given time, the Justice Department is investigating several hundred allegations of
     criminal police misconduct around the country. Since 1993, the Justice Department has
     criminally prosecuted more than 300 law enforcement officers who have engaged in
     police misconduct - resulting in over 200 convictions.
