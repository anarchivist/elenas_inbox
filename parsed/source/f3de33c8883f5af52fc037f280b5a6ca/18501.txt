         PRESIDENT CLINTON: FIGHTING JUVENILE CRIME AND DRUG USE

       "Now, we must work together to do more, to protect our children from the scourge of
       violent crime and especially from crimes committed by other young people. This is now my
       highest law enforcement priority. We must provide for more prosecutors and probation
       officers, tougher penalties, and also better gang prevention efforts, including after school
       programs, so that young people have something to say yes to and some way of staying out
       of trouble. "

                                                               --President Clinton, October 9, 1997

While overall crime rates have been declining, juvenile crime and drug use remains a serious problem.
 Juvenile gun murders have quadrupled, teenage drug use has risen, and youth gangs have spread to
large cities and rural towns throughout America. In the State of the Union, the President again
challenged Congress to confront this issue and pass his Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy.
Specifically, his strategy and budget call for:

·      Targeting Gangs and Violent Juveniles. To help state and local prosecutors crackdown on
       gang members and violent juveniles, the President has proposed $150 million to hire new
       prosecutors and expand anti-gang task forces; $60 million to establish juvenile gun and drug
       courts that ensure swift and certain punishment for youthful offenders; and tough new
       penalties and prosecutorial tools.

·      Cracking Down on Guns and Gun Traffickers. To keep violent juveniles from buying
       guns as adults, the President's strategy also proposes to ban violent juvenile from buying guns
       on their 21 st birthday. His strategy also increases penalties for selling handguns to juveniles
       and other offenses, and includes $28 million to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction
       Initiative (YCGH) that helps local law enforcement trace illegal firearms to their source.

·      Keeping Kids In School, Off Drugs and Out of Trouble. To ensure that kids are
       supervised from 3 to 8 pm -- the time when most violent juvenile crimes are committed -- the
       President's strategy proposes $95 million for the Justice Department to help keep schools
       open later and to promote anti-truancy initiatives and curfews. The President's Child Care
       Initiative also quadruples funding for Department of Education-sponsored after school
       programs, and his Drug Strategy includes new funds for Safe and Drug-Free schools.

        Key Components of the President's Juvenile Crime Strategy in the FY 1999 Budget:

       Prosecutorial Initiatives                      -- $150 million
       Courts and Probations                          -- $60 million
       At-Risk Youth Initiative                       -- $ 9 5 million
       Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative        -- $28 million
       Safe and Drug-Free Schools/Coordinators        -- $606 million
       21 st Century Learning Centers                 -- $200 million
       Anti-Drug Media Campaign                       -- $195 million
