Subject:         Low-Income Housing/Homeownership

The bullet in the memo to the President on new ideas combines the
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and Homeownership Tax Credits
targeted at low-income families.  Substantively, this does not make much
sense.

As the full LIHTC bullet in the last draft of the memo stated, the LIHTC
helps "develop more affordable rental housing." The tax credits we are
now examining would lower the barrier to homeownership for low-income
families.

The way the bullet is now written is very confusing and makes it seem as
though the two proposals are redundant and have the same goal.  If the
President believes that these policies have a similar purpose -- which
they do not -- I fear that we will have a tougher sell during the
budget/tax process.

If the issue were space, it would have been easy to cut from the section.
Indeed, some of the initiatives are in the millions of dollars, while this
homeownership initiative may be in the range of a billion dollars.
Moreover, I assume tax credits for homeownership have more "lift" than
initiatives, such as homeless assistance for veterans.

I don't know if this can be corrected now, but a lot of hard work has gone
into making the homeownership tax credit workable.  with the homeownership
rate of lower income families a fraction of the homeownership rate of
higher-income folks, this initiative should be a central part of the
President's community empowerment budget.
