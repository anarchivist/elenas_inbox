TEXT:
Over the last year, there have been many discussions about how to shift
the message on choice. NARAL's new innovative campaign, "Choice for
America," is aiming to do just that.

This unprecedented, multi-million dollar effort will consist of paid
advertising, marketing, aggressive grassroots organizing and community
outreach in 36 selected communities.

Kate Michelman has requested your participation in a briefing to review
the "Choice for America" campaign in order to hear your feedback. Harrison
Hickman, the leading pollster on choice issues, will also share his latest
findings.  Ann and I invite you to meet with Kate on Wednesday, Feb. 24th
at 4 pm in the Ward Room. We appreciate your taking time out of your busy
schedules for this one-hour meeting.
Please have your staff RSVP to Kelley O'Dell (x6-7300). Thank you.
