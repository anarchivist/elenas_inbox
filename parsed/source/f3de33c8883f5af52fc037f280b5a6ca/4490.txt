TEXT:
We now have 42 signatures on the Bingaman letter threatening to filibuster
Labor/HHS if it doesn't let the test move forward.

We are still trying to get Byrd, who has not yet responded, and Graham,
who has already said no.  Riley is very close to Graham; if I can track
him down in CA tonight, I will ask him to call Graham. Wellstone also has
turned us down; he's a much longer shot, though Riley has done him a
couple of very big favors, so I will ask Riley what he thinks about
calling Wellstone also.

Rahm is in charge of the timing and nature of the release on this, though
in the main we are aiming to get this out on Friday.

As you know, Ashcroft has got 27 signatures--including 14 R's who voted
for the Coats amendment and have now gone the other way--on a letter
urging the conferees to support Goodling.

I have asked Checker to take some public step in support of the Senate
bill--an op-ed, something with Bennet.  I also have a call in to Engler
for the same.
