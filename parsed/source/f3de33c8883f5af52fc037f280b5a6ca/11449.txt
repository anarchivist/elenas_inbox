MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                          Jacob J. Lew
                               Bruce Reed

SUBJECT:                       Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Regulation

        OMB has before it for final clearance regulations to implement the 1997 amendments to
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The initial proposed rulemaking in
1997 generated substantial adverse reaction from the majority in Congress, from schools, and
from States, primarily centered on the administrative burdens the draft rule would have imposed.
 The current version is a reflection of a lengthy process of public comment and negotiation with
Congressional staff and represents substantial compromise from the earlier version. States and
Congress have also complained about the delay in publication of the final rule. In response to
State and Congressional concerns over delay in publication, Secretary Riley has publicly
committed to publication by March 5th.

        We believe the current rule offers a balance between protecting children with disabilities
and mitigating burden on the States and the schools within the context of a law which all agree is
highly prescriptive. Involved majority Congressional staff have given preliminary indications
that they believe this version of the rule is an adequate response to their concerns, but they note
that some members may still attack the rule as providing insufficient local flexibility. While the
NGA and its staff did not comment on the proposed rule, there is no guarantee they will support
the final version; indeed, we would not be surprised if some Governors criticize the rule as overly
prescriptive. On the other side of the issue, the disability community will be unhappy with some
ofthe compromises the Department of Education has made since the proposed rule, and would
object to any further significant changes. This memorandum explains the issues in more detail,
describes the improvements made to date, and at the end, summarizes the equally contentious
issue of IDEA funding.

Background

        In 1975, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which
guaranteed a "free appropriate public education" for all students with disabilities, and outlined
the required procedures States and local school districts must follow in implementing their
Special Education programs. That law, now known as the IDEA, has been amended several
times since, most recently in 1997.
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

        The IDEA Amendments of 1997 were the result of extensive bipartisan negotiation with
Congress. The reauthorization retained the civil rights component ofthe law that requires States
to provide all children with disabilities (also referred to as special education students) with a free
appropriate public education designed to meet their individual needs. This requirement applies
without regard to the cost of the services or the size of the federal appropriation. The 1997
amendments added a focus on improving educational outcomes for children with disabilities.
For instance, they required States to develop educational achievement goals for children with
disabilities, and to include children with disabilities on State and district-wide assessments.

        IDEA has always been controversial because it imposes prescriptive and costly
administrative requirements on States. Because of these statutory requirements, States want
the federal government to pay a larger share of special education costs. In recent years,
controversy has centered on IDEA's requirements regarding the discipline of special education
students. States are not required to accept IDEA funding and its related federal mandates, but
none have seriously threatened to withdraw from participation.

IDEA Regulation Generally

        The regulatory development process for this rule has been lengthy and contentious.
After publishing the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in October 1997, the Department
of Education (ED) received extensive criticism from State lawmakers, school officials, and the
majority in Congress. State lawmakers and school officials complained that the proposed rule
was complex and difficult to understand, limited flexibility at the local level, and created overly
prescriptive and costly requirements. The majority in Congress echoed these concerns, and
charged that the rules created policies inconsistent with the carefully worked out bipartisan
agreements that had been struck during the enactment of the IDEA Amendments of 1997.

        In response to these concerns, the Department reviewed the entire rule to find ways to
ease requirements, and to make the final rule easier to understand. The Department's rewrite of
the rule involved extensive consultations with the Hill and members of the public, and resulted in
a significantly different document. 'Nonetheless, the rule remains complex and prescriptive,
largely (though perhaps not entirely) because the statute itself is of this nature.

        ED hopes to publish the final rule in early March. Both Hill members and school
officials have put great pressure on the Department to publish the rule as soon as possible.
Without the rule, schools must implement their special education programs based only on their
own interpretations of the IDEA statute. The rule will help forestall litigation resulting from
local disputes over statutory interpretation.




                                                  2
                                                                                  Hex-Dump ConversIon


        The Department believes, and we concur, that the final rule strikes an appropriate balance
among the interested parties, including the disability community, school officials, State
lawmakers, and members of Congress in both parties. As always, however, not all the interested
parties will see things in this way. Some (mostly Republican) members of Congress and State
officials will view the rule as skewed in favor of the disability community and/or as creating a
need for additional IDEA funding. Conversely, the disability community will express some
disappointment about changes made since the NPRM and would vehemently object to further
retrenchments.

Specific Regulatory Issues

        Criticism of the draft rule focused on three issues: (1) discipline of disabled students who
are violent or troublesome; (2) placement of disabled students during adjudication of disputes
over current placement ("pendency"); and (3) services required after graduation. In discussion
on the rewrite of the final rule, a final issue emerged concerning the inclusion of special
education students in regular education classrooms. Each issue is discussed below.

Discipline: The IDEA amendments allow school personnel to suspend students with disabilities
for up to lO school days before the suspension is deemed a "change in placement." The
amendments further require that when a "change in placement" occurs, the school district must
convene the student's special education teacher, parent, regular education teacher, and principal
to: (1) reevaluate the type and extent of educational services the student should receive during
hislher suspension in order to best allow the student to achieve the goals in their Individualized
Education Plan (IEP); (2) establish a "behavioral assessment plan" for the student (i.e., a set of
services and strategies designed to address and improve the student's behavior), if one does not
already exist; and (3) determine whether the student's behavior is a manifestation of his or her
disability.

        The statute does not specify whether the 1O-day trigger for a "change in placement" refers
to 10 consecutive days ~, a suspension of 10 or more days in a row) or 10 cumulative days
over the course of a school year~, five separate two-day suspensions). Under past practice,
this language was interpreted to mean that "change in placement" services were not required
unless the suspension was for 10 consecutive days or there was a "pattern of short-term
removals." This consecutive interpretation, of course, was favored by most school officials,
who wish to provide "change of placement" services in only the most extreme cases. Under this
standard, however, school officials could abuse the "10 consecutive day" trigger by repeatedly
suspending a student for less than 10 days to circumvent the "change in placement" requirement.
 Although the "pattern of short term removal" standard was supposed to protect against such
abuses, ED found that it was rarely invoked and did not provide sufficient protection.




                                                 3
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

        In response to these concerns, ED defined" 10 days" in the NPRM as meaning 10
cumulative days in a school year. Thus, under the NPRM, schools would have to provide
"change in placement" services after 10 cumulative days of suspension, without regard to the
"pattern of short term removal" concept. Not surprisingly, school officials and the majority in
Congress strongly objected to this "cumulative day" definition because it would have triggered
the expensive "change in placement" services more frequently.

        As a compromise, the final rule requires the full panoply of "change in
placement"services only after 10 consecutive days or a pattern of removals, but requires a less
burdensome, streamlined set of services designed to address behavior problems after 10
cumulative days of suspension. For example, under this streamlined procedure, schools will no
longer have to determine whether the student's behavior is a manifestation of their disability.
This compromise results in significant cost savings to schools compared to the NPRM scheme; it
does, however, impose more costs than under prior practices, because it requires some (albeit
streamlined) procedures when separate suspensions total more than 10 days. Conversely, the
compromise provides the disability community with some services in the 10 cumulative day
case; but the streamlined services are far less extensive than the full services promised in the
proposed rule and will strike the community as inadequate.

        In addition to these significant changes, the final rule also clarifies the following
discipline issues which were points of confusion in the proposed rule: (1) school officials can
suspend disabled children for more than 10 days in a school year; and (2) school officials do not
need to provide any serv'ices to disabled children during the first 10 days of a suspension.

Pendency: The IDEA statute sets up a hearing process to arbitrate between a parent and a school
when they disagree over a child's placement (U, whether a child should be moved from a
special education class to a regular education setting). Until the disagreement is settled, the
statute requires the child to remain in hislher current placement unless the school and parent
agree otherwise.

        The contentious provision in the proposed rule would have provided the following: in the
event that a parent sought to change the child's placement, and the hearing officer agreed with
the parent, the child is immediately moved to the new placement. However, in the event that a
school sought to change the child's placement, and the hearing officer agreed with the school, the
child would remain in the original placement pending further review. Thus, hearing officer
agreements with parents were to carry more weight than hearing officer agreements with schools.
 Proponents of this provision argued that it was needed to equalize the balance of power between
schools and parents in the implementation of special education services for children; opponents
argued that the asymmetrical system was inconsistent with the statutory language and in fact
skewed that balance.




                                                4
                                                                                      Hex-DiJmp Conversion

        As a compromise, the final rule applies this asymmetrical "pendency" provision only if a
child's case reaches a State (rather than district or county) hearing officer -- a level of review that
occurs far less frequently. In all other cases, the child would remain in hislher original
placement pending appeal, regardless of whether the child or the school won the initial decision.

High School Graduation: In the proposed rule, ED required that schools reevaluate all graduating
students to determine whether additional services should be provided; ED also provided
non-binding guidance that schools could terminate services only if a student graduated with a
regular diploma (i.e., not a certificate of attendance). ED included these requirements because
of the concern that some school districts were "graduating" students with a less-than-regular high
school diploma in order to stop providing services to them. However, schools do not have to
provide any services to students once they "age out" of eligibility under state law. The "age-out"
threshold varies among States -- ranging from age 18 to 21.

        In response to complaints about this policy, the final rule eliminates the reevaluation
requirement when students graduate with a regular high school diploma. The final rule,
however, continues to maintain that schools may not terminate services to students who graduate
with less than a high school diploma.

"Least Restrictive Environment": A fundamental part of the IDEA statute is the belief that
special education children should be placed, to the maximum extent possible, in the "least
restrictive environment" -- which means in the general education environment. This
requirement is designed to provide special education students with an opportunity to socialize
with regular education students and to strive for the same academic goals as their nondisabled
peers. At the same time, the statute reflects some understanding that placing some special
education students in regular classrooms is too disruptive, because it requires teachers to spend a
disproportionate amount oftime with special education students. The statute requires that: (1)
whenever appropriate, special education students should be placed with their nondisabled peers;
(2) schools can remove special education students from general education classrooms ifit is
found that the student is not making satisfactory educational progress, even with supportive
special education services.

       To prevent abuse of the second requirement, the Department added to the final rule a
provision (not in the NPRM) prohibiting schools from removing special education students from
a general classroom only because teaching the student would require a modification to the
standard curriculum. Majority Congressional staff initially opposed this change, but appear to
have dropped their objections; minority staff support the provision.

Special Education Funding

         Most of the Governors and some members of Congress argue that the federal government
is failing to live up to its "commitment" to provide States with 40 percent ofthe average per
pupil expenditure for each disabled student. In fact, however, IDEA makes no such
commitment; it only limits the maximum grant a State can receive in a year to this 40 percent
level. The highest percentage ever reached was 12.5 percent in 1979; 1999 funding should
cover about 11.2 percent.

        Federal funding for special education State Grants (the primary federal special education
program) has increased by $2.2 billion or 110 percent during this Administration, from $2.1
billion in FY 1993 to $4.3 billion in FY 1999. These increases are much larger than the increases
requested by this Administration. Congressional Republicans in recent years have seized on
IDEA as a defining issue, which enables them to complain about "unfunded mandates" and
"regulatory burdens" while supporting education funding. We believe this pattern will be
repeated for FY 2000.

        Whatever amount we might propose for IDEA, the Republicans will always be able to
offer more, because they do not care about funding our other education and training priorities at
the levels we seek. In response to Republican claims that we are underfunding IDEA, we have
argued that many of our other high priority investments substantially aid children with
disabilities. These children benefit, for example, from the smaller classes in our Class Size
Reduction initiative, from modem school facilities in our School Modernization Bonds proposal,
and from our early intervention initiatives such as America Reads and Head Start.

         In the FY 2000 budget, we propose a targeted increase for special education of $116
million to expand early intervention programs and to help States take advantage of research on
effective practices, but virtually no increase for the major state grant. The total budget request
for all parts of IDEA is $5.4 billion, of which $4.3 billion is for the state grant.

       It should also be noted that the IDEA Amendments of 1997 provided that when federal
funding reached $4.1 billion, an LEA could divert up to 20 percent of the federal funds it
receives in a year that exceeds the amount it received in the previous year (i.e., 20 percent of their
annual increase in federal funds) away from special education. Therefore, federal IDEA
increases do not increase spending on children with disabilities dollar for dollar.

Likely Reactions to Rule

        As noted above, some Governors and members of Congress will criticize the final rule as
overly prescriptive and/or will argue that it provides yet another reason for more Federal funding.
Further substantial changes to the rule, however, would generate an equally negative reaction
from disability advocates (who may already be unhappy about changes from the NPRM).
Further changes also would require further delay which will generate criticism from all sides.
