FYI. I had asked our folks to check on this.  Your thoughts about timing?
We could wait and see what happens on CJS and do it while POTUS is on vaca
as news one day.

NICS User Fee Proposal

I talked with DOJ and they have checked with their Legislative staff who
believe that to publish the NICS user fee rule now would be inflammatory
given the Senate CJS amendment. But, DOJ does need adequate time for
public comment on the proposal.  Consequently, the answer to your question
is that it would be wise to delay for a couple of weeks, but DOJ would
need to publish this rule by the end of August at the latest in order to
not jeopardize the NICS operational deadline of November 30th.

What is the ramification if the proposed rule does not go out for another
couple of weeks? (not that that is going to happen, I would just like to
know if asked)

NOTE TO:           Sylvia Mathews

THROUGH:           Don Arbuckle

FROM:          Victoria Wassmer

RE:                Impact of Legislation on the NICS User Fee Proposed Rule

This is a note to follow-up on your question to Don regarding the
legislative situation for the
FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) user fee
proposed rule.
The Senate CJS appropriations Bill yesterday adopted a Smith (R-NH)
amendment, 69-31,
that would prevent the FBI from charging a user fee to fund the
implementation of NICS.
During a brief debate on the floor, Senator Kohl (D-WI) charged the
amendment as a veiled
attempt to gut the Brady Law.

At this time we have no knowledge of a similar provision in the House
version of CJS, although an
amendment could be introduced on the floor.  Given the prediction from
Legislative Affairs that it is
highly unlikely a CJS appropriations bill would be completed and out of
conference before
the end of September-early October, the OMB staff recommendation, and the
DOJ preference, is
for OIRA to clear the proposed rule for public comment as soon as
practicable. This would still
allow time for DOJ to change course in the fall before issuing the final
rule, if necessary.


Please let me know if you have any further questions.
