                 Talking Points: DNClDomestic Partner (Health Care)
                            Benefits for Same Sex Partners

Background: Starting July 1,1997, the DNC will make available to domestic partners of its gay and
lesbian employees its health care benefits program. The proposed definition of domestic partners is: "two
unmarried adult individuals of the same sex who have cohabitated for at least twelve consecutive months
in an exclusive, intimate relationship to be of indefinite duration."



Q:       What is the President's view of the DNC's decision to provide same sex domestic partner benefits
for its employees?

A:      He believes that businesses and not-for-profit organizations have that option. It is up to them to
determine what is in their best interest and in the best interests of their employees. It is noteworthy that
some of America's largest and most prominent corporations such as American Express, Bank of America,
Eastman Kodak, IBM, Microsoft, Time Warner and Xerox now provide domestic partner benefits. The
DNC appears to have made a similar business decision.

Q:      Did the President approve the DNC policy before it was announced? Was he aware of it?

A:    No. Decisions relating to employee benefits are made by the Chairman and senior DNC
management. The White House was made aware of the policy change at a staff level.

Q:      What is the White House policy on this -- are White House employees eligible for domestic
partner benefits?

A:      No. White House employees are governed by the same rules as all other federal employees and
these benefits are not currently available to federal employees.

Q:     Would the President support an effort to make domestic partner benefits available to federal
employees?

A:      As there are millions offederal employees, this issue - which is relatively new - would at a
minimum first have to be studied by Congress and the Executive Branch and examined under a
cost/benefit analysis.

Q:      Is such a study currently underway?

A:      Not to my knowledge.

domestic partner benefits are an important way to give recognition to their relationships. Does the
President agree?

A:       The President is aware that many communities and institutions are considering whether' basic
benefits can be provided outside the context of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these
issues is to remain sensitive to the values of our communities while preserving the fundamental right to
live free from unjustified discrimination. In our country's history we have, for good reason, looked first to
state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to consider evolving issues like these. I think
that the President supports the efforts of business and communities to find solutions that work for them and
their employees in an age when many Americans are in non-traditional relationships.
