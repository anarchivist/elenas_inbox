TEXT:
Yesterday, I circulated for review and comment a Justice Department letter
on HR 3862, the Child Custody Protection Act, which would make it illegal
to transport minors across state lines for the purpose of avoiding state
parental involvement laws. The letter is to be transmitted prior to the
House Committee on the Judiciary's markup of HR 3862, which is scheduled
to resume on Tuesday, June 23rd.  JUSTICE WOULD LIKE CLEARANCE OF ITS
LETTER TODAY.

Please let me know by 1:00 p.m. today if you are going to have any
comments to the Justice letter. NOTE: The Justice letter was promised to
the Committee in Chief-of-Staff Bowles' June 17th letter to Rep. Hyde on
this legislation.

Thanks.
