Q:   WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO TODAY'S NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF
     MEDICINE ARTICLE CRITICIZING AZT STUDIES IN AFRICA?


A:   First of all, in 1994, a group of international experts convened by the World Health
     Organization thoroughly reviewed the studies on women conducting experiments on
     pregnant women infected with HIV in Africa, Thailand, and other countries and
     determined that they are scientifically well-founded, ethical and essential to conduct to
     advance the fight against AIDS. Since then these studies have been reviewed by ethical
     committees of not only the United States and European institutions involved but, in every
     case, by an ethical cotnmittee from the countries in which the studies were carried out.
     Moreover, the women who participate in the studies are fully informed about the nature
     of the studies.

     Due to poor economic conditions and low standards of public health care in participating
     countries, the women who participate in these studies are not able to afford the expensive
     protease inhibitors and other AIDS drugs available in the United States. These studies
     are taking place solely to find a treatment for AIDS that would could be extended to these
     nations. Unless we conduct these much needed studies we will never make the progress
     we need to make sure that AIDS treatments become more affordable and can be extended
     to all nations.


Q:   DOES THIS STUDY UNDERMINE DR. SATCHER'S CREDIBILITY AND HIS
     CANDIDACY TO BECOME SURGEON GENERAL?

A:   Absolutely not. Dr. Satcher has been extremely involved in the thorough reviews of
     these studies. He has been part of decisions made by the scientific and international
     communities that these studies are the most ethical and best way to advance the fight
     against AIDS. Moreover, Sidney Wolfe, the author of the New England Journal study that
     criticized these AZT studies recently stated that "Dr. Satcher is one of the most ethical
     people he has ever met." We certainly do not think that Dr. Satcher's credibility, ethical
     judgernent, or candidacy for Surgeon General are undermined by this study.
