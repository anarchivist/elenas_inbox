                            PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                             REMARKS ON THE BRADY BILL
                                  THE ROSE GARDEN
                                    August 6, 1998

       Acknowledgments: VP; Sec. Rubin; AG Reno; Sarah and Jim Brady; VP of Intemat'l
Brotherhood of Police Workers TK

        I want to thank Sarah and Jim Brady for all their hard work. For years, police, families,
and the victims of violence waged the fight on their own for safe streets, safe homes, and safe
schools. Washington sat on the sidelines. In 1993, we moved to the front lines -- joining people
like Sarah and Jim and the law enforcement officials we have here today.

        Today I want to talk about the progress we've made in our country's fight against crime
and the steps we must take to build on that progress. More than five years ago, we made a
commitment as an administration to recover our nation's streets from crime and violence, to
provide security for America's families. It required a new, comprehensive strategy of law
enforcement, based simply on what works: on community policing, strong anti-gang efforts, and
targeted deterrence; on tougher penalties and smarter prevention.

        Our strategy -- from the Brady Bill to the Crime Bill, from the assault weapons ban to the
Violence Against Women Act -- is showing remarkable results. We are well on our way to
putting 100,000 new police officers on the streets, ahead of schedule. All across America, crime
rates are down -- violent crime, property crime, murder -- dropping to a 25-year low overall.
Americans should take pride and comfort in our steady progress.

        The Brady Law, in particular, shows the progress America can make when we take
responsibility for the safety of our families and our communities. Since the Brady Law took
effect, gun trafficking and gun-related crime are down dramatically. It is no wonder: according
to a recent report by the Justice Department, background checks have put a stop to nearly.!L
quarter of a million handgun purchases since the law took effect. Last year, 62 percent of those
rejections were based on felony convictions or indictments. That's 118 felons a day turned
away, thanks to the Brady Law. That's 118 felons a day going home empty-handed instead
of well armed.

        As we near the fifth anniversary of the Brady Law and celebrate its progress, we must
continue to press ahead in the fight against crime and violence. We're beginning to win the
battle; what we cannot do is retreat. Yet that is what the gun lobby and its allies on Capitol Hill
would have us do -- retreat from a law that is keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, retreat
from the national interest and surrender our safety to special interests.

       Now, before the Brady Law even goes fully into effect, the gun lobby and its friends in
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Congress are trying to destroy it. They claim to support the National Insta-Check System -- but
would deny the FBI the funds it needs to make the system work. They claim to support
background checks -- but would have the FBI destroy records that are vital to the process. [Let
me be clear: I will veto any legislation that would gut the Brady Law and put guns back
into the hands offelons and fugitives.] Congress should step up to its responsibility, put
progress above partisanship, and stop playing politics with public safety.

       Years of experience show that the Brady Law works, and now we must do everything in
our power to make it even more effective. I urge Congress to extend -- permanently -- the
5-day waiting period before it expires in November. Too many crimes are committed within
hours of a handgun purchase. The waiting period gives tempers time to cool. It gives potential
criminals time to consider the consequences, and gives local law enforcement officials time to
check all relevant records, even those that are not computerized, and stop every last prohibited
person from walking home with a gun in hand and violence in mind.

         The real measure of our progress, of course, is more than the decline in crime. It is the
rise in responsibility and respect for law. For those of us in public life, it is our sworn duty to
uphold the law and our moral obligation to strengthen it -- especially those laws that protect our
families, save lives, and draw a clear, indelible line between right and wrong. That, at heart, is
what the Brady Law has accomplished; and that is the vision to which we must all remain true if
we are to build a safer, stronger America for the 21 st century.
