TEXT:
Here are some points that we think might be good to include in the
President's remarks to NGA reo welfare reform:

We suggest that the PresidentD,s remarks to the NGA:

Commend the Governors for their leadership on welfare reform and cite our
successes.

Commit to the governors that we will work with them to protect full
funding for the welfare block grant, but they must also do their part by
maximizing this opportunity to make critical investments in child care,
transportation, on-the-job training, and other supports for families
moving from welfare to work, including efforts to ensure families moving
from welfare to work receive Food Stamps and Medicaid.

Note that we're fighting for additional resources to help the hardest to
serve welfare recipients get and keep jobs, help low-income fathers
increase their' employment so they can better support their children, and
provided needed transportation, housing, and child care for those moving
from welfare to work.   Recognize the leadership of a number of Governors
on fatherhood issues - including Ridge, Carper, Rossello, Thompson
