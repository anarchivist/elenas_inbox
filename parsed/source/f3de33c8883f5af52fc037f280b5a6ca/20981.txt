TitleADDITIONAL VIEWS ON ISSUES IN H.R. 60

In addition to the concerns outlined in Secretary Rileys letter,      this attachmen
t expresses the Administrations views on other important issues       in the confere
nce on the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. The issues are        discussed in t
he order in which they appear in the current law or, in the case      of new program
s, in the passed versions of the bill.

DAlcohol and drug abuseD
Both the House and Senate versions of the bill would authorize the Department t
o offer grants and recognition awards to combat the illegal use of drugs and al
cohol on campus. The Secretary would be authorized to make grants to or enter
into contracts with institutions for alcohol, drug and violence prevention prog
ramming.  This authority is similar to a program that already exists in the Saf
e and DrugFree Schools program. While we believe this activity is very importa
nt, we do not believe that it needs to be authorized in both the Higher Educati
on Act and the Safe and DrugFree Schools Act.  We recommend maintaining the aut
horization in Safe and DrugFree Schools.

DInstitutional aidD
Both versions of the bill make several positive changes to the institutional ai
d provisions that the Administration has recommended.  Both versions of the bil
I allow institutions participating in Title III programs and HispanicServing In
stitutions (HSIs) to use up to 20% of their grant funds to establish or expand
an endowment fund and expand allowable activities to encourage institutions to
use technology.  Both versions would provide the HSI program more visibility by
 moving the program to a separate part in a different title, and simplifying th
e definition of HSI.  Both the Senate and the House versions authorize grants f
or Tribal Colleges, as proposed by the Administration.

We prefer the House language on the changed funding formula for Historically Bl
ack Graduate Institutions (HBGIs) with the addition of the substance of the des
criptive factors in the Senate provision for a competition; this will provide a
 more equitable distribution than either provision by itself. We also support
the Senate provision for a minimum grant of $1,000,000 to institutions before m
atching is required and the $28,000,000 threshold for the use of the funding fo
rmula.

DPell Grants]
We appreciate the strong support for the Pell Grant program that is evident in
both versions of the bill, and are very pleased to see that many of the Adminis
trations proposals for the Pell Grant program have been included in either one
version or the other.
header#XX2PQXP##XP\      P6QXP#
headerWe support the House provision to extend the cohort default rate cutoff t


 o Pell Grant eligibility. This extension will increase institutional accountab
 ility and better protect students from unscrupulous schools. 0 OWe believe that
   the mitigating circumstance provisions that the Department has adopted in regu
 lation for the student loan programs protect those institutions in which only a
   few students borrow, and we would like to work with the conferees to incorpora
 te mitigating circumstances directly into the statute for purposes of instituti
 onal eligibility to participate in the Pell Grant program.
 header#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#
 headerStyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\         P6QXP#We support the Senate version of the bills in
 lusion of the 150% time limit on student eligibility for Pell Grants, the new r
 equirements for standalone English as a Second Language (ESL) programs, the tui
 tionsensitive award rule, and the extension of Pell Grant eligibility to colleg
 e graduates enrolled in a nongraduate teacher training program. The Administrat
 ions proposal to limit·Pell Grant eligibility to 150% of the time normally requ
 ired to complete the course of instruction, with adjustments for students atten
 ding parttime and exemptions for students with disabilities, would prevent abus
 e of the program. We urge that the Administrations proposal to impose a total
 time limit of eight academic years of full time study, or the equivalent period
  of parttime study, be added to the 150% limit in the final version of the bill

StyleO
The Senate provision that students in standalone ESL programs may receive Pell
Grants only if a minimum percentage of the programs students pass an English pr
oficiency exam will also increase program integrity.  The Senate version also i
ncludes the Administrations proposal to clarify that tuition includes fees req
uired for attendance, and that the institution may determine the dependent care
Idisability allowance.

 Finally, the Senate version includes a provision that would allow college gradu
 ates to receive Pell Grants on a casebycase basis for a fifth year if they are
 enrolled in a teacher training program.   This program would provide new assista
 nce to encourage college students to become welltrained, motivated teachers.   H
 ow ever , we need to ensure that it is administratively workable. We look forwar
 d to working with you in conference to refine this provision.
 o
 TRIO programsD
 Current law provides for grants of both four and five years in the TRIO program
 s. The House version of the bill adopts the Administrations proposal to standa
 rdize grant duration in the Talent Search, Upward Bound, Student Support Servic
 es, Postbaccalaureate Achievement, and Educational Opportunity Centers Programs
  at four years; the Senate version of the bill does not change current statutor
 y provisions. We strongly support the Houses changes, since current law is con
 fusing to the community, presents little or no practical benefit and is adminis
 tratively complex.

The House version of the bill would eliminate the current administrative setasi
de of 0.5% of appropriations for the TRIO Programs.  The Senate version of the
bill retains the setaside.  Eliminating the setaside would have a significant a
nd negative impact on the Departments ability to administer the TRIO Programs e
ffectively.  We support the Senate version.

CCampusbased programsD
The Administration proposed modifying the campusbased aid formula to gradually
distribute a larger share of the program appropriation on the basis of measured
 institutional need for funds.    The House version would eliminate the pro rata
 step.   However, this change could lead to some institutions allocations being
reduced too quickly, rather than the gradual shifts proposed by the Administrat
ion.   The Senate version has n·o comparable change, and, thus, fails to respond
to changes in institutional need.    We urge the conferees to adopt the Administr
at ions proposal.



College awarenes~~
Neither passed version of H.R. 6 would authorize the college awareness program
proposed by the Administration. Recent studies have shown that lowincome stude
nts attend college at significantly lower rates than individuals from high and
middleincome families, not because of financial inability to attend college but
 because of a lack of information about the requisite steps to prepare for, app
ly for, finance, and enroll in college. A college awareness program is a cruci
al element in our efforts to increase college attendance among lowincome studen
ts, and would complement well the High Hopes program, which received support in
 both versions of the bill.

OGuaranty agencies and voluntary flexible agreementsO
Both versions of the bill authorize up to six guaranty agencies to enter into v
oluntary flexible agreements with the Department. Guaranty agency arrangements
 need to focus more heavily on preventing defaults, and voluntary flexible agre
ements could help promote greater administrative efficiency and improved servic
e for students.

The Administration supports components of both the House and Senate versions of
 the guaranty agency reform, including the House provisions to allow the Secret
ary to regulate the operating fund when monies are owed to the Federal fund and
 to allow the Secretary to waive or modify any statutory requirements for agenc
ies that enter into voluntary flexible agreements. The Administration supports
 the provision in the Senate version that specifies that voluntary flexible agr
eements cannot restrict borrowers from selecting the lender of their choice. T
he Administration also supports the Senate provisions to prohibit agencies that
 fail to make scheduled payments from receiving additional Federal funds, to re
quire the Secretarys approval before agencies may support other student aid act
ivities,   to prohibit agencies from depositing interest earned on the Federal f
und in the operating fund, and to reduce the loan processing and retention allo
wance fee.   The Administration opposes the Senate provisions that would add bur
densome notice requirements regarding voluntary flexible agreements.

StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\      P6QXP#The Administration also supports the provision of th
e House version that requires guaranty agencies to invest funds deposited into
their operating funds in accordance with prudent investor standards, rather tha
n the Senate provision which permits investment of the fund at the sole discret
ion of the guaranty agency.
StyleOD
heading l#XP\    P6QXP#OFFEL repaymentO
 heading lOWe support the Senate provision to offer extended repayment plans 0
f up to 25 years to FFEL borrowers with loans in excess of $30,000. We also su
pport the House provision that allows FFEL borrowers to retain their interest s
ubsidies when they consolidate their loans.  These changes would benefit FFEL b
orrowers with heavy debt burdens and would help level the playing field between
 the two loan programs.  In addition, we support consideration of efforts to ex
tend incomecontingent repayment plans to FFEL borrowers.

OOrigination and insurance feesD
Unfortunately, neither version would lower the upfront loan fees for students.
 Reducing the origination fees for Direct Loans and the insurance fees for FFEL
 loans would reduce students cost of borrowing. The Administration proposed to
 lower the fees by one percentage point for all borrowers, and to phase them ou
t entirely for borrowers of subsidized loans. These fee reductions could be inc
luded in the conference agreement if their costs are appropriately offset.D

heading 3#XP\    P6QXP#DLoan forgivenessD
 heading 3 DBoth the House and Senate include programs to forgive loans for tea
chers in highpoverty schools. We support encouraging students to teach in the


schools where their talents are needed most.   However, changes are neededO Oto
the program as currently written to make the program more effective and its adm
inistration, by the Department, institutions, guaranty agencies, and lenders, m
ore workable.   For example, because of the need to track student loans separQte
ly under the loan forgiveness provisions as currently structured, a student see
king loan forgiveness would be unable to consolidate his or her student loans.
 This is inequitable because it would limit the students repayment options.   In
 addition, the House and Senate versions of the bill also contain provisions fo
r loan forgiveness for child care workers.   In lieu of these proposals, the Adm
inistration supports its Child Care Provider Scholarship Fund, which would prov
ide more than $300 million in scholarships over five years to up to 50,000 chil
d care providers annually
header#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#
headerWe would like to work with you on making the loan forgiveness provisions
more equitable and effective.    Options to consider include: treating all Feder
al student loans equally, regardless of the year in which they were received; 0
ffering loan forgiveness from the first year of teaching, or explicitly providi
ng forbearance for the first years of teaching; changing the percentage of loan
s that may be forgiven each year; and creating a simpler administrative and fin
ancing mechanism for for both teachers and child care workers.
StyleO#XX2PQXP#
StyleO
Body Text 2#XP\ P6QXP#Finally, under both versions of the bill, borrowe
rs who have their remaining outstanding loan balance forgiven after 25 years of
 incomecontingent repayment must continue to pay taxes on the amount forgiven.
 Saddling borrowers with additional tax liability is neither appropriate nor wa
s it ever intended. The Administration supports adding a provision to exempt t
he amount forgiven from Federal income taxation.

 Body Text 2"0
 Lending from proceeds of taxexempt obligationsO
 Under current law, secondary markets using taxexempt funds must file a plan for
  doing business with the Department. This provision includes substantive restr
 ictions on discrimination and on payment of premiums exceeding one percent for
 loans. The House version of the bill would eliminate both the filing requiremen
 t and the restrictions. The Senate version eliminates the filing requirement a
 nd the payment of premiums restriction, retaining only the nondiscrimination pr
 ovision. The Administration supports elimination of the filing requirement but
  retention of both substantive restrictions.

[ICommuni ty service defermentD
Neither version would permit the Secretary to pay the interest that accrues on
an unsubsidized FFEL or Direct Loan while the borrower is receiving an economic
  hardship deferment on the loan and performing community service. This importa
nt proposal is part of the President's call to action to all Americans to serve
  their communities, and would allow individuals with student loans who qualify
for economic hardship deferments to take up to three years to serve their commu
nities without accruing additional interest on their loans. This would remove a
  financial obstacle to community service for borrowers who already satisfy econ
omic hardship criteria, such as Peace Corps volunteers.

OMarketbased mechanismsD
The Administration continues to support an objective, marketbased determination
 of appropriate rates of return for lenders on student loans. A number of diff
erent market mechanisms have the potential to achieve this outcome, and we are
eager to work with Congress to find the right approach. We also support obtaini
ng financial information from FFEL lenders as part of a new study that could be
tter guide the Congress regarding the profitability of lenders and the forrnulat
ion of policy on student loans.O


heading l#XP\    P6QXP#DWorkstudy community serviceD
 heading 1
Body Text 2#XP\ P6QXP#1'he House version of the bill would add seve
ral burdensome requirements.  First, it would add a requirement that at least t
wo percent of an institution's allocation (in addition to the current five perc
ent community service requirement) be spent on early childhood reading tutors.
 The House version of the bill would also require institutions to give priority
 in workstudy funds to students tutoring in schools that meet certain criteria,
 a requirement which would unnecessarily complicate institutions' administratio
n of the program. The Department has had great success with its voluntary part
nerships with America Reads tutors, and prefers to continue with that approach.


Body Text 2"
DPerkins LoansD

Body Text 2#XP\ P6QXP#Both the House and Senate version of the bills would el
iminate the Federal Perkins Loan revolving fund account; the House would do so
explicitly in order to subsidize loan forgiveness for teachers in the FFEL and
Direct Loan programs. We oppose this elimination. Without this fund, Congress
 would need to provide an increase in discretionary appropriations for Perkins
Loan Federal Capital Contributions in order to avoid reducing loan volume.   In
addition, the House version of the bill includes forbearance provisions, inc Iud
ing mandatory forbearance for Perkins Loans recipients during a term of nationa
I service, that should be expanded to be comparable with FFEL and Direct Lendin
g.

Body Text 2"
heading 3#XP\     P6QXP#DNeed analysisD
 heading 3 StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\    P6QXP#We are pleased with the House provisions
to combine parent and dependent student assets to eliminate the differential as
sessment rates and to increase the income protection allowances significantly.
 These changes will protect more of the earnings of needy students, will restor
e Pell Grant eligibility to many nontraditional students, and are a step in the
 right direction toward encouraging saving, increasing fairness, and simplifyin
g the financial. aid process for students and families, as proposed by the Admin
istration. However, we note this change would increase discretionary spending,
and thus the funding of these provisions would need to be examined during the a
nnual appropriations process.
StyleD
StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\       P6QXP#We are also pleased that both the Senate and House v
ersion of the bills would add an offset for dependent students in the amount of
 the parents negative available income. This offset would exclude from need an
alysis calculation the income of a student whose earnings are necessary for the
 familys living expenses.   The Administration supports the House version of thi
s offset since it allows for the use of "adjusted" available income as an offse
t against dependent student income. This means that any negative amount remain
ing after first offsetting any contribution from parental assets would then be
used to offset dependent student income. The Senate version, on the other hand
, would allow the full unadjusted negative available income to offset both pare
ntal assets and the same amount again to offset dependent student income.   In a
 sense, the Senate proposal would inappropriately provide a double counting adv
antage.
StyleD
Neither the House nor the Senate included language clarifying that financial ai
d administrators may adjust need determination to assist dislocated workers.   T
he Administration has requested this change in recent letters to Congress, and
will continue to seek to include it in the final version of the bill. DO

DMultiyear promissory note; formsD


The House version of the bill would require a multiyear promissory note within
180 days of the enactment of the reauthorization bill. The Senate version woul
d L·equire the Secretary to develop a master promissory note for use beginning J
uly 1, 2000. We agree that a multiyear promissory note will simplify the proces
s by which students and their families apply for and receive federal student 10
ans.  In fact, we are currently in the final stages of developing the procedure
s and notes for the introduction of a master promissory note with a multiyear 1
oan renewal process in both the FFEL and Direct Loan programs. We expect the n
ew notes to be available for the 19992000 academic year, with borrowers who app
ly for loans for the 20002001 year being the first who would benefit from the #
Xx6X@DQX@#A#XP\ P6QXP#multiyear functionality,#Xx6X@DQX@#@#XP\ P6QXP# since t
hey would have signed the master note during the prior year. With these target
s in mind, and in order to ensure that the processes work properly and effectiv
ely, we would prefer that the law not include a specific timeframe.

 The Administration is also disappointed that neither version of H.R. 6 would pr
 ovide the Secretary with the authority to approve alternative forms to determin
 e need and eligibility for student aid that contain the same information as the
  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as long as the entire form is
  provided free of charge, as was proposed by the Administration.   The use of a
 Iternative free versions of the FAFSA, especially electronic versions, could re
 duce burden for students and families while streamlining the aid award process

  The Senate version of the bill would require the Secretary to verify aid appl
icant's tax return information with the IRS. The Administration has several con
cerns regarding the income verification proposals in both the House and Senate
versions, including confidentiality of taxpayer information, and IRS resource a
nd systems capacity issues (particularly in light of the Year 2000 conversion u

DDrug offendersO
We oppose the language in both versions of the bill suspending aid eligibility
for students who have been convicted of any drug offense under Federal or State
 law. This provision would largely duplicate existing law denying Federal benef
its to individuals convicted of a drug offense under Federal or State law. Curr
ent law also contains important judicial discretion provisions that are lacking
 in both versions.

 CFreely Associated StatesD
 Under current law, citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic
  of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau attending any eligible inst
 itutions may be eligible for Pell Grants and certain other forms of student fin
 ancial aid.   (Students who are permanent residents of the Freely Associated Sta
 tes may be eligible for such aid to attend institutions in the Freely Associate
 d States.) The Senate version makes no change to these provisions. The House v
 ersion would terminate the eligibility of students who are citizens or permanen
 t residents of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, or Palau on October 1, 2001, a
·nd,  until then, they would be eligible only if they attend an institution in G
 uam, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, or Palau. We strongly oppose the House
 provisions. The united States has a special relationship with these countries,
  as well as a responsibility to assist them in nationbuilding, and the State De
 partment has raised questions about the international significance of curtailin
 g Federal student aid and its potential impact on the negotiation of future com


pacts with the Freely Associated States. Finally, it would be useful if the fin
al version of H.R.6 were to include a clearer expression of congressional inten
t that the eligibility of these students from the FAS was not affected by the e
nactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act
 of 1996.

heading 3#XP\    P6QXP#DRefundsD
 heading 3 DAlthough we are pleased that the Senate adopted the Administration'
s general approach for calculating refunds, we have strong concerns about allow
ing schools to retain all Title IV funds for students who withdraw from an inst
itution without going through an official withdrawal process. This policy woul
d create a huge loophole that would encourage abuse in reporting withdrawals an
d recouping appropriate funds.   It would reward institutions for unofficial wit
hdrawals by students by giving those students the same amount of student aid as
 is given to students who complete the term. We also have some drafting concer
ns regarding this provision. We hope to work with you to adopt the Senate appr
oach with some changes.

OProgram integrityO
The Administration opposes a variety of provisions in the House version that wo
uld weaken program integrity. The House provision to allow proprietary institu
tions to include revenues from job training contracts as part of the requisite
15% of revenues from nonTitle IV sources would seriously undermine the intent 0
f the 8515 rule, which was to ensure that eligible institutions are not primari
ly dependent on public monies to exist.

The House version also would vitiate the antiinjunction provision in current la
w.  This provision prohibits injunctions against the Secretary that interfere w
ith the Secretarys responsibilities in the loan programs. An institution with a
n official cohort default rate that would remove it from the loan programs stil
1 may receive loan funds during the course of its administrative appeal of its
loss of eligibility, but if the institution loses its administrative appeal, it
s participation ends. The antiinjunction provision has prevented institutions
whose loan eligibility has been terminated on the basis of high cohort default
rates from receiving loan funds while they sue the Secretary over the terminati
on.   An institution still may receive loan funds during the course of its admin
istrative appeal of its loss of eligibility, but if the institution loses its a
dministrative appeal, its participation ends. We strongly believe that the ins
titution should not be able to enjoin the Secretary to restore its participatio
n during the course of a lawsuit. Without the current antiinjunction provision
, these lawsuits could be used as a delaying tactic by unscrupulous institution
s merely to obtain more loan funds. The antiinjunction provision has prevented
millions of dollars of loan funds from going to high default schools that were
properly terminated from the loan programs.   It would undermine program integri
ty to undo this wellestablished precedent.

Body Text#XP\    P6QXP#D
o
The Senate version provides that schools with default
rates of over 50 percent for three consecutive years would not be eligible to p
articipate in the Perkins program. We believe this provision would be too leni
ent, and prefer a provision that would end participation for an institution wit
h default rates of 25% or higher for three consecutive years. This change woul
d standardize the cohort default rate cap across Federal student loan programs.

 Body Text
Finally, we oppose the provision in the Senate version of the bill that require
s the Department to calculate a program participation rate index for each insti
tution subject to loan eligibility termination on the basis of high cohort defa
ult rates.  The participation rate index is currently used in the mitigating ci


rcumstances appeals process, where the calculation is performed by the institut
ion. The Department does not have data on the number of 'loaneligible students
at each institution, and therefore cannot calculate the participation rate inde
x for all institutions without imposing significant new reporting requirements
on institutions for no substantial benefit.

Electronic exit counselingO
The Senate version of the bill would allow institutions to provide personalized
 electronic exit counseling for borrowers. While we believe that current statut
ory language allows the use of technology for exit (and entrance) counseling, a
nd the Department has been moving in this direction, we support this clarificat
ion.
::J
Campus securityO
The Administration generally supports most of the changes made by the House and
 Senate versions of the bill. Both versions would require institutions to mai
ntain open crime logs and expand the number of crimes that must be reported; we
 support these changes.  They also contain language permitting disclosure of ca
mpus disciplinary records.  Both versions have drafting flaws that would underm
ine their effectiveness and compromise legitimate privacy interests. We look f
orward to working with the conferees to develop more acceptable language.

The Senate version of the bill clarifies and expands the definition of campus,
so that institutions have to report crimes that take place on public property c
ontiguo~s to the campus, e.g. sidewalks, and in any building owned by the insti
tution or a student organization. This information is critical for students to
 know and will help provide a more accurate picture of crime on campus.

OViolence against women on campusO
We support the language in both the House and Senate versions of the bill that
would authorize a grant program to prevent violence against women on campus. V
iolence against women is a serious issue, and this program would help female st
udents feel safer on their campuses. The Senate also authorizes a study of cam
pus sexual assault policies, which would shed new light on the controversial is
sue of how campus authorities handle sexual assaults.

OQuality assurance (QA) and experimental sites programsO
The House version of the bill would effectively end these two programs, replaci
ng them with a "Regulatory Simplification Program" that would not allow for wai
ver of statutory requirements, or provide for alternatives for administering th
e programs. The Senate version of the bill does attempt to expand the areas in
cluded in the QA program, but then undermines that expansion by specifically Ii
miting waivers to verification, as is now the case in the current QA program.
The Administration supports the inclusion of the waivers necessary to give effe
ct to the expanded scope of the QA program included in the Senate version.

Body Text#XP\    P6QXP#O
o
The Senate version of the bill would make less drastic
 changes to the experimental sites program than the House version. The Senate
version includes requirements that the Secretary review all projects and report
 to Congress his recommendations to streamline and improve student aid programs
 based on the projects (these reporting requirements would also be applicable t
o the QA program).  It is important that the experimental sites program be cont
inued, as it has provided administrative relief to institutions with strong per
formance managing the student financial assistance programs and has supported i
mportant research into alternatives to current law and regulation.  The provisi
ons in the Senate bill for both programs are preferable to those in the House v
ersion of the bill.
 Body Text


DNegotiated rulemakingO
The House and Senate version of the bills are overly broad in scope and include
 unrealistic time requirements that would actually impede effective negotiated
rulemaking. The Administration strongly opposes the requirement that all futur
e Title IV regulations be subject to negotiated rulemaking regardless of their
technicality or urgency, skewing resources away from the most important issues
and generating unnecessary litigation, delay, and expense. We hope to work wit
h Congress to develop a workable process for fashioning more focused and flexib
Ie regulations. That process should include the ability to negotiate with the
higher education community to identify the issues to be subject to negotiated r
ulemaking.
1"1
Loan prorationD
We support the House versions language on loan proration. The House provisions
 move in the direction of the Administration proposal and would simplify prorat
ion by allowing it to be done proportionally for all types of loans affected.

OAbility to implement regulations earlierO
The Senate version of the bill includes the Administrations proposal to authori
ze the Secretary to designate regulatory provisions that institutions or other
entities may choose to implement before the otherwise applicable effective date
 which, as required by the Master Calendar, includes a delay of at least seven
months. These changes would provide the Secretary and program participants with
 greater flexibility.

OBiennial review of regulationsD
The House version of the bill would require the Secretary to conduct reviews of
 regulations every two years. The Senate version also requires the Secretary t
o review regulations, but does not specify frequency.  The Department already r
eviews its regulations regularly, and feels that either version of this provisi
on would be an unnecessary and inappropriate intrusion upon the Secretarys auth
ority and responsibility to manage the Department.

heading 3#XP\     P6QXP#DFinancial responsibilityD
 heading 3 StyleO#XX2PQXP##XP\    P6QXP#The House version of the bill contains co
nfusing language that could be read to undermine the wellreceived financial res
ponsibility regulations that the Department recently developed in close coopera
tion with the higher education community and to establish a dangerously low sta
ndard for the financial health of institutions participating in student financi
al aid programs. We oppose these provisions
StyleO#C\         P6QP#
#XP\      P6QXP#DProgram review criteriaD
x'      hp x (#!The Administration opposes the provision in both versions of the bil
1 that would require the Department to prioritize program reviews based on crit
eria in statute, such as high default or withdrawal rates, or large fluctuation
s in Pell Grant and loan volume.   This is unwarranted micromanagement.  The Dep
artment selects its program review sites based on a probabilistic risk analysis
 model. While this model incorporates many of the criteria listed in the Senat
e provision, strict adherence to the provision would require the development of
 a new model and would remove all flexibility for the Department. We are confi
dent that the current program review selection model effectively targets proble
m institutions while maintaining an element of randomness to promote broad prog
ram compliance.

DStudent loan ombudsmanD

Body Text 2#XP\ P6QXP#The Senate version of the bill would establish a Studen
t Loan Ombudsman Office to assist borrowers with problems with their student 10
ans. We understand the desire to provide a place for students to go, if they ha


ve particularly complex student loan problems, or have been frustrated by other
 attempts to resolve these problems.  This is the kind of customeroriented acti
vity that we would want a PBO to address, and we would prefer for the new Chief
 Operating Officer (COO) to determine its structure and mission. However, if t
he conferees intend to include statutory language regarding an Ombudsman, we wo
uld seek changes to the Senate provisions. For example, the relationships betw
een the Secretary, the COO, and the ombudsman are very unclear, which would res
ult in a substantial danger of poor coordination in providing services to stude
nts. We hope to work with Congress to look at the role and function of an ombu
dsman and to relate any such office appropriately to the PBO.

 Javits and GAANN eligibility would be limited to students who demonstrate fina
ncial need; forwardfunding of Javits would be permitted; the Fa'culty Developmen
t Fellowship program would be redesigned; and Assistance for Training in the Le
gal Profession would be replaced by the Thurgood Marshall Legal Educational Opp
ortunity Program. The Administration supports the House approach to consolidate
 all graduate programs into one, which is closer to the approach proposed by th
e Administration, with the addition of the Administrations provisions for stude
nts from underrepresented groups.

OTeaching students with disabilitiesO
We support the Senate version of the bills new program to provide competitive g
rants to colleges to improve teaching for students with disabilities. The gran
ts would support technical assistance and training for faculty and administrato
rs to enable them to .effectively teach students with disabilities. Many more s
tudents with disabilities are now benefiting from higher education; the grants
would help faculty members better reach these students.

heading 3#XP\    P6QXP#OAdvanced placementO
 heading 3 OWe are pleased that both versions of the bill would reauthorize the
 current Advanced Placement Fee Payment Program, the Senate with significant mo
difications. We prefer the Senate version of the bill; however, we recommend t
hat the final bill clarify that any State in which all lowincome individuals ar
e required to pay no more than a nominal fee to take advanced placement test sO
Dmay use any remaining funds to increase the participation of lowincome student
s in Advanced Placement courses and exams through activities such as informatio
n dissemination, teacher training, and curriculum development.

The Senate version of the bill attempts to accommodate this recommendation in p
art, by permitting States to use up to 5 percent of grant funds to disseminate
information about the program and by providing an exception to the supplement,
 not supplant rules when funds are used to increase the participation of lowinc
orne individuals in advanced placement courses through teacher training and othe
r activities directly related to increasing the availability of Advanced Placem
ent courses. However, the supplanting language isO Overy difficult to understa
nd andO Oinconsistent with the Senate committee reports description of the prog
ram.

Another problem with the Senate language concerns the provision that notwithsta
nding an appropriation, the Secretary shall award grants for this program only
if the College Board funds its fee assistance program at no less than the level
 of the previous year. It is inappropriate for the behavior of a private organi
zation to determine whether a nationwide Federal program, for which funds have
been appropriated, can be carried out. We recommend that this language be elimi


 nated, and that the conferees instead include report language recommending that
  members of the appropriations committees should consider whether the College B
 oaL'd and other private efforts are continuing their support.

 ize the Education of the Deaf Act include a provision to eliminate the 10 perce

 1 cost of subsidizing these students. Elimination of the cap, without a corres
 ponding increase in the tuition surcharge for international students, would res
 ult in resources being diverted from other university level programs to support

 The Senate version of the bill would establish a Liaison for Proprietary Instit

Dear Conferee:

I am pleased that versions of H.R. 6, a bill to reauthorize the Higher Education Act of
1965 (HEA), have passed both the Senate and the House, and I greatly appreciate the
hard work that you and your staff have devoted to this important legislation. I am
especially pleased that both versions of H.R. 6 have adopted the student interest rate on
new loans at the level proposed by the Vice President last winter. This will help students
better manage their postsecondary education debt and thus make college more affordable.

We now have the opportunity to work together during the conference deliberations to
enact a strong bipartisan bill that will help more Americans prepare for and gain access to
college, improve teacher recruitment and preparation, and promote better program
management. In this work, we must all keep our focus on the goal of producing
legislation that is grounded in sound educational and fiscal policy to provide maximum
benefits to students. That is the ultimate purpose of the Higher Education Act.

The Administration is working with the Congress to resolve OMB/CBO cost estimating
differences and develop mutually agreeable legislative language that would eliminate the
risk of a Government-wide sequester as a result of its passage. However, there remain a
number of other extremely serious issues which must be resolved in order for me to be
able to recommend that the President approve the conference bill. These include ensuring
that there are no reductions in the student aid administrative funds available to the
Department to administer both the Federal Family Education Loan and Federal Direct
Loan programs; and offering borrowers the same low interest rates on FFEL and Direct
Consolidation loans.

I am confident that these and the other important issues presented by the the bills now in
conference, and explained further in this letter and attachment, can be resolved in a
manner that serves students well by our working together in good faith. This letter and its
attachment highlight the issues in the HEA reauthorization that are of particular
importance to the Administration.
                                           HeX-OUlllfJ \..ullll.;[sion                  DRAFT
                                                                                 3/l0/l0 10:00 AM


Interest rates
I am pleased that both the Senate and House versions would lower the interest rates that
students pay on new loans by .8 of a percent, as the Administration proposed. This
reduction is a major accomplishment that will provide substantial savings for students.
I am concerned, however, that many current borrowers are struggling with excessive debt,
and need to have access to the lower interest rates as well. The final version ofH.R. 6
should reduce the interest rate on FFEL Consolidation Loans so that it is the same as the
rate applicable to Direct and FFEL student loans and Direct Consolidation Loans. This
policy is consistent with our HEA reauthorization proposal to have the same low
consolidation rates in both loan programs.

In order to provide the low consolidation rate for students in the FFEL program, it may be
necessary to maintain current subsidies or adjust the offset fee to ensure that loans
continue to be sufficiently profitable. At the same time, however, subsidies that both the
House and Senate versions of the bill would provide to lenders in the Stafford and PLUS
loan programs are too high, and I urge you to reduce or eliminate them.

Section 458
I remain adamantly opposed to any cuts in the student aid administrative funds available
to the Department under section 458 of the HEA beyond those agreed to in last year=s
balanced budget package. Both the House and Senate versions include such further
decreases, and the House version would decrease section 458 funds even more
substantially than the Senate version. Decreases in section 458 funds would impair the
Department's ability to administer effectively the FFEL and Direct Loan programs by
threatening the Department's ability to manage such activities as student aid application
processing, student loan default collection, and the urgently needed modernization of
student aid delivery systems.

Both the Senate and House versions would create a new loan processing and issuance fee
to be paid to guaranty agencies from section 458 funds. I strongly support the Senate=s
provision to cap this fee to better ensure sufficient funding for the efficient administration
of the loan programs.      However, the Senate=s decision to offset the amendment
regarding need analysis determinations for veterans receiving G!. Bill benefits with funds
from section 458 undermines the Department=s ability to manage the loan programs. I
hope to work with you to find a more suitable offset for this provision.

National Board for Professional Teaching Standards
While I understand that the language in H.R. 6 on the National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards will be satisfactorily resolved, I want to reiterate my strong opposition
to the House language, which would prohibit Federal funds from being made available to
the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. By defining standards of
excellence for experienced teachers, the National Board helps to focus and upgrade
                                                    I"

teacher training, recognize and reward outstanding teachers, and kt:ep our best teachers in
the classroom, where they are needed most. As both Houses have recognized in the
teacher recruitment and preparation provisions of the HEA, attracting and keeping
well-trained teachers in the classroom is a national priority and an essential step to
increase student achievement.       More than half the States and a growing number of
school districts offer incentives to teachers to seek Board certification, and have made
Board certification an integral part of their overall efforts to strengthen teacher quality.
By ending Federal support for the Board's research and development, the House
provision jeopardizes completion of the remaining professional standards and assessments,
and undermines these vital State and local efforts. This is the wrong step to take at
precisely the time when we must do everything possible to set the highest standards for
our teachers.

High Hopes
I am very pleased that both versions address the importance of early outreach to at-risk
youth. The House version includes the Administration=s proposal for High Hopes for
College, while the Senate created a new AConnections@ program that incorporates certain
elements of High Hopes and the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership
(NEISP) program. I look forward to working with the conferees to ensure that the final
version of the program encourages colleges to partner with high-poverty middle schools,
offers comprehensive services to all students at these middle schools, and is
administratively feasible.

Teacher training and recruitment
Both the House and Senate versions would authorize grants to States and local
partnerships to reform and improve teacher training. The Senate version, which would
divide funding equally between States and partnerships and would focus the partnerships
on improving teacher education, offers a better chance at meaningful change than the
House version, which limits partnerships= share of funding to 33 percent. Partnerships
that involve colleges, teacher training programs, K-12 schools, and other entities will
encourage more interaction among practicing teachers, aspiring teachers, and professors
of education to better prepare teachers for 21 st century classrooms than will State-level
efforts.

I am pleased that the Senate version includes the Administration=s program to recruit
new teachers for underserved areas through partnerships between colleges and
underserved school districts. The House version fails to include sufficient efforts to
recruit new teachers in order to address the pressing need for teachers in disadvantaged
urban and rural areas. I urge the conferees to adopt the Senate=s program for teacher
recruitment.

Both versions include accountability provisions that require State and institutional .I\report
cards@ on the quality of teacher education. While I endorse reporting requirements that
will provide more information about the teacher training process, I am concerned about
eliminating students from student aid eligibility for some programs based on the
inadequate performance of others.

Distance Jearning
We have made significant progress on the issue of distance learning, and I am pleased
that both the House and Senate versions include demonstration programs to
accommodate the new technologies and innovations that can greatly increase access to
postsecondary education. The House provisions, which would allow the Secretary to
waive any need analysis or general provisions for a representative sample of institutions
(or consortia of institutions), would provide more flexibility and opportunity than the
Senate provisions. The Senate version would authorize the waiver only of particular
statutory provisions and any need analysis or general provisions regulations for 15
institutions or consortia initially, to be expanded to up to 50 in the third year of the
program. I urge the conferees to provide sufficient flexibility in the demonstration
projects to allow for the development and support of high-quality distance education
programs, as contained in the House version.

I am also pleased that the Senate version authorizes the Administration=s Learning
Anytime Anywhere Partnership (LMP) program, which would encourage partnerships
to develop innovative ways of delivering education, ensuring quality, and measuring
student achievement that are appropriate to distance education. I urge the conferees to
adopt LAAP.

PBO
I am glad that provisions that would create a Performance Based Organization (PBO) for
the administration of the student aid programs were included in both passed versions of
H.R. 6. I prefer the PBO provisions in the Senate version, in part because these
provisions explicitly provide for personnel and procurement flexibilities necessary for the
successful operation of the PBO. I also ask that the conferees provide the PBO with
buyout authority, comparable to that which the Congress previously provided to
non-Defense agencies, to assist in transforming the organization to the new PBO
structure.

Year 2000
It is anticipated that all Department systems needed to deliver Federal student aid will be
fully compliant with Year 2000 requirements no later than March 1999. However, the
Department is still concerned that all of its partners and customers, particularly institutions
of higher education, may not be able to ensure that all their data systems related to the
delivery of aid are also compliant. In light of that concern, it is important that the final
version of the bill authorize the Secretary to delay implementation of those provisions
with significant systems implications if earlier implementation would jeopardize the ability
of the Department, or its partners or customers, to ensure that their data systems are Year
2000 compliant. In utilizing such discretion, the Department would work in close
consultation with the Office of Management and Budget and the House and Senate
authorizing committees.

Program integrity
There are numerous House and Senate provisions pertaining to program integrity, that,
taken together, the Administration would regard as a serious weakening of current
program integrity protections. These provisions include changes regarding program
review criteria, financial responsibility, the anti-injunction provision and the A8S-1S@ rule.
  Our concerns with these provisions are described in more detail in the attachment.

I.&:JE
The Senate version contains a provision amending the Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families program (TANF). It would expand the type and length of education programs
that may be counted toward a State's "work activity" participation rate. The provision
would also extend the FY98 and FY99 exclusion of teen parents from the cap on
education programs that may be counted toward a State's "work activity" participation rate
to FY2000 and beyond. The Administration strongly supports the goals of enabling
more welfare recipients to move from welfare to work and providing educational
opportunities for those who do. We look forward to working with conferees to ensure
that the final legislation keeps the doors of college open to all Americans while still
maintaining the welfare law's strong work requirements.

Pav-As- You-Go Scoring
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 requires that all revenue and direct
spending legislation meet a pay-as-you-go requirement. That is, no such bill should
result in an increase in net budget costs, and, if it does, it will trigger a sequester if not
fully offset. Statements of Administration Policy on the two versions of the bill as reported
out of committee indicated that each version had significant net costs. . The
