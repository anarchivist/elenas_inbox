TEXT:
The word is that the Republican leadership thought the idea on the table
(amending the Shaw plan to allow no prevailing wage, union organ1z1ng, or
punitive damage awards) does not go far enough.  They want to either:

           1) Start anew; or
           2) Add a new title defining a type of community work experience
                   that is training and would not be subject to FLSA

Haskins is apparently meeting with governors staffs tomorrow to discuss.
