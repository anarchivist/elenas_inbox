TEXT:
I've informed CNP that Erskine will do the speech on Monday.  I'll ok
their description, but I'm inclined to be very general -- he'll talk about
the importance to the President of passing tobacco legislation that
protects kids, public health, and about the principles the President has
established for any legislation.  Does anybody have any better ideas or
want this to be more specific?
