     MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:

     SUBJECT: Proposed changes to status of disabled children caught in school with a fireann


     CURRENT LAW

     Gun-Free Schools Act: The Gun-Free Schools Act requires states, as a condition of receiving
     federal elementary and secondary education funding, to put in place laws under which students
     who bring guns to school are expelled for at least one year. There is no requirement that the state
     or school district provide expelled students with educational or other services during their
     expulsion, except in the case of students with disabilities, when the Gun-Free Schools Act must
     be implemented in accordance with Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
     requirements. (Note: Your ESEA reauthorization proposal would require that students expelled
     under the Gun-Free Schools Act receive counseling, if needed, before returning to school. It
     would also require schools to adopt discipline codes providing that all students expelled or
     suspended from school receive appropriate counseling, supervision and educational services).

     IDEA Regulations: Under current IDEA regulations, school authorities can unilaterally remove a
     disabled student who brings a weapon to school to an alternative placement for up to 45 days, but
     must continue to provide educational and other appropriate services to the student. During those
     45 days a "manifestation detennination" is undertaken to detennine whether or not the infraction
     was a manifestation of the student's disability. If the offense is deemed unrelated to the
     disability, the student is subject to the same punishment - in this case expUlsion - as nondisabled
     students, except that education services cannot be tenninated. Ifit is detennined that the
     student's disability affected his actions, then the student's Individual Education Plan - which
     specifies the appropriate educational and behavioral services for the student -- is revised to
     include appropriate behavioral interventions. Regardless of any relationship between the
     student's disability and actions, if there is concern that the student poses a continuing threat, an
     impartial hearing officer may agree to suspend the student for an additional 45 days - a process
     that can be repeated indefinitely.

     In 1997, the House (420-3) and Senate (98-1) overwhelmingly approved the reauthorized IDEA
     bill, allowing school officials to discipline students as outlined above. The regulations enforcing
     the IDEA reauthorization were released by Education this March.

     PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

     FristiAshcroft Amendment: The FristiAshcroft proposal would amend both the IDEA and the
     Gun-Free Schools Act by allowing school personnel to expel or suspend students with

                                                      1
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


disabilities for potentially unlimited amounts oftime for bringing a gun or firearm on school
premises, in the same manner as school personnel discipline students without disabilities. This
would eliminate requirements for providing these students with appropriate behavioral
interventions, or for determining whether their behavior is a manifestation of their disabilities.
The amendment would also permit schools to deny all educational services to disabled students
while suspended or expelled, unless the local educational agency required that those services also
be provided to students without disabilities. Finally, parents would be denied their current right
to request a due process hearing regarding these removals under the IDEA.

Secretary Riley has sent a letter to Congress strongly opposing the Fristl Ashcroft amendments.
He argues, among other things, that the recently-released IDEA regulations give schools new and
appropriate tools to deal with these situations; that denying education services, including
behavioral interventions, to children with disabilities eliminates the best chance for improving
the long-term prospects for these children; and that eliminating determinations of whether a
child's behavior is a manifestation of his disability could result in unlawful denials of education
because of a child's disability.

Harkin Amendment: Senator Harkin's proposal would essentially maintain the status quo for
disabled students -- and expand protections to other students -- by requiring that appropriate
interventions and services be provided to all students expelled or suspended for any act of
violence, including carrying a weapon on school premises. This proposal includes an
authorization of appropriations for "such sums as may be necessary" for fiscal years 2000-2004
to be distributed by the Secretary of Education.

As you know, Senator Harkin has requested a letter from you opposing the FristiAshcroft
proposal and supporting the Harkin amendment.
