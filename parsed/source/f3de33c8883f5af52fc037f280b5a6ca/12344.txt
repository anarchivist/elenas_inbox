     Hi, sorry to be so slow getting back to you. The Kosovo supp is slowing
     down
     (surprise!). The House is looking to mark up next Thursday (a week from
     today), with floor action not scheduled, but probable the week after that
     (5/4-5-6). The Senate may have a hearing next week but has no other action
     scheduled.  The Senate may not take the bill up on the floor, just try to
     merge
     the committee bill in conference on Central America (to avoid long and
     onerous
     amendment process on the floor), assuming the House passes a Kosovo bill.
     So a
     conference on Central America/Kosovo would be unlikely to start until
     5/11, or
     so, at this point. Also, I am almost positive that I read somewhere in
     the
     last few days that Kay Bailey and Graham were saying that if Kosovo went
     as a
     separate bill (which currently appears unlikely) they wanted tobacco on it
     b/c
     legislatures were going out of session, etc., fyi.   Obviously, the timing
     on
     all this keeps shifting around constantly ...
