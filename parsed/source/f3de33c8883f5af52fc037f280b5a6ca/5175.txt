                               THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATON:
                            DRA WING A LINE AGAINST HATE CRIMES


                     The Clinton Administradon:       Fighting Hate in Our Communities

         On October 22, 1997, a federal grand jury returned a one count indictment in United States v.
         Bybee, charging Greg Bybee with violating one count of federal civil rights statute. On
         December 27, 1996, the victims, a Native American and Mrican American interracial couple,
         were assaulted and threatened with a firearm by the defendant at the home of the female victim's
         father on an Indian reservation in Boise, Idaho.

         In Richland, Mississippi, four members of a neo-Nazi skinhead organization, pled guilty to
         conspiracy and interfering with the housing rights of an interracial couple by throwing a
         molotov cocktail at their trailer home.

        Three defendants, one of whom is a racist skinhead and a member of the white supremacist
        group "South Bay Nazi Youth," were convicted of a civil rights conspiracy after they drove
        through the streets of Lubbock, Texas, hunting Mrican-American men, luring them to the
        conspirators' car and shooting the men at close range with a short-barreled shotgun. One
        victim died, one was seriously wounded in the face and another had a finger blown off.

         In Livingston, Texas, six defendants pled guilty to civil rights charges for beating randomly
         selected Mrican-American men with a rifle and a rodeo belt buckle, and punching them
         repeatedly as they tried to escape. The defendants had been angered at seeing other black men
         in the presence of white women. The adult defendants were given prison sentences ranging
         from 20 to 43 months.

         In Livermore Falls, Maine, two defendants were sentenced to almost 6 years and almost 7 years
         following their guilty pleas to civil rights charges after threatening four Latino victims, chasing
         them by car from the store, and firing shots at the victims' fleeing car, wounding one victim in
         the arm.

                        Fighting Hate Crimes Through Tough Law Enforcement

Vigorously Prosecuting Hate Crimes Under the Civil Rights Statutes. Several distind federal
statutes provide jurisdiction to prosecute hate crimes -- crimes where the perpetrator selects his
victim on the basis of certain charaderistics such as race, color, religion, and national origin.
Since 1989, over 500 defendants in more than half of the 50 states have been convided on
federal criminal civil rights charges for interfering with various federally protected rights of
minority VIcttms. Virtually all defendants charged in these cases have been convicted.
President Clinton's Justice Department has vigorously prosecuted hate crime incidents,
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

particularly where the defendants were members of organized hate groups, such as the Ku Klux
Klan, The Order, and various skinhead gangs.

Enhanced Penalties For Hate Crimes. As part of the historic 1994 Crime Act, the President
signed the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement which provides for longer sentences where the
offense is determined to be a hate crime. In 1996 alone, 27 cases received enhanced sentences.

The Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Provides Expertise in Arson and Explosives
Investigations to Help Fight Hate Crimes Throughout America. While enforcing explosives and
arson laws over which it has jurisdiction, ATF has participated in the investigations of bombing
and arson incidents at predominantly gay bars such as the incidents reported in Atlanta. For
example, in the bombing of the gay nightclub, which occurred on February 21, 1997, the ATF
joined the FBI in a task force headed by the U.S. Attorney.

Gun Regulation Helps Stem the Flow Of Firearms that C(In Fuel Hate Group Activity. Many
organized hate groups use guns to carry out violent offenses covered by hate crime statutes.
Treasury bureaus work to intercept gun shipments into the U.S. and to regulate the illegal sale
and possession of firearms by potential perpetrators of hate crimes and other offenses.

Targeting Ignorance:

Focusing on Youth Attitudes that Create Hate Crimes.    The Department of Education is
supporting efforts at the local level to develop and implement innovative effective strategies for
preventing and reducing incidences of crimes and conflicts motivated by hate in localities directly
affected by hate crimes. The Department has funded programs aimed at reducing violent
behavior among youth motivated by hate or bias.

Understanding the Problem of Hate Crimes:

Gathering Information on the National Scope of the Problem. The FBI Uniform Crime Report
collects the only national data on hate crimes through the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
Program, and has established guidelines for the collection of such data, and criteria for a finding
of prejudice. In 1996, 1l,355 law enforcement agencies across the country participated in the
data collection efforts, representing 84 of the nation's population. From these departments
alone, there were 8,734 reported incidents of hate cimes in 1996.[FBI, Uniform Crime Report --
Crime in the United States 1996, 1997]

Studying Anti-Gay Hate Crimes: The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has funded
the first large-scale study of the mental health consequences of hate crimes. The preliminary
principal findings of this research are that hate crimes based on sexual orientation appear to have
more serious psychological effects on lesbian and gay men than do other non-bias motivated
crimes. The study also provides information about the prevalence of anti-gay hate crimes, the
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
rate at which these crimes are reported to the police, and the prevalence of other harassment and
discrimination against gay men and lesbians.·

Prosecuting Hate Crimes Aimed At Our Houses of Worship:

Fighting Hate Crimes Aimed at Houses of Worship. The President fought for and signed the
Church Arson Protection Act of 1996, which facilitates prosecutions of racially motivated arsons
and other acts of desecration against houses of worship.

Creating the National Church Arson Task Force. President Clinton established the National
Church Arson Task Force in June 1996 to oversee the investigation and prosecution of these
cases, in response to an outpouring of national concern over arsons at houses of worship around
the country. The NCATF has brought together the FBI, ATF, Justice Department prosecutors,
and the Cornmunity Relations Service, in partr}ership with the state and local law enforcement
officers and prosecutors. Well over 200 ATF and FBI investigators have been deployed in these
investigations. In addition, the NCATF has coordinated with other agencies, such as the federal
Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, in
the federal government's efforts to promote arson prevention and in providing resources for
church rebuilding.

~      Many of the 508 incidents investigated have been solved, mainly by a combination of
       federal and state arrests and prosecutions. Since January 1995, arrests of 240 suspects
       have been made. The 240 arrests have led to over 100 convictions, including the first
       convictions under the 1995 Church Arson Prevention Act, 18 U.S.c. 247, as amended.
       This rate of arrest (35 ) for crimes that may have been motivated by hate or bias is more
       than double the 16 rate of arrest for arsons in general. As of June 1997, Federal, state,
       and local prosecutors have successfully convicted no defendants in connection with fires
       at 77 houses of worship since January 1995.[Treasury]


Working with Communities Against Hate

Bringing Communities Together to Fight Hate. The Department of Justice's Community Relations
Service often becomes involved when a hate crime incident threatens harmonious racial and
ethnic relations. When a hate crime takes place, the Service uses mediation to provide
representatives of community groups and local governments with an impartial forum to restore
stability through dialogue and discussion. It conducts training conferences on hate crime
prevention and response for state and local law enforcement and other governmental agencies,
academic institutions and civic, business and community organizations. The Community
Relations Service assists local government and organizations in appropriate contingency planning
to ensure that marches, demonstrations and similar events occur without exacerbating racial and
ethnic tensions.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Fighting Intolerance in our Schools and Communities. The Clinton Administration also supports
several desegregation centers. These centers have provided training and technical assistance on
hate and bias crimes, and have developed model programs and practices. The desegregation
centers and policies and have identified programs that are working in schools to prevent the
behavior that leads to hate crimes.[Department of Education, 10/97]
