    TEXT:
    Martha - Katie mentioned to me your conversation earlier today
    about not filing a petition for rehearing for the geographic scope
    (sales versus area) decision. As you know, none of the agencies
    and none of the enviros recommended fighting this further.
    One of the important reasons there's not a lot of interest in
    continuing to fight this is that virtually all of the sales went
    out the door this past winter when we lost the motion for stay.
    There are arguably one or two sales that could be caught up if we
    lose the murrelet or previously enjoined sale decisions and some
    of those sales are in the broader area, but not very much volume.

    I can assure you, however, that any lack of feverent attention or
    interest in fighting this on the part of the enviros will be more
    than compensated by the reaction regarding the murre let sale
    decision.  I keep having to assure people on an almost daily basis
    that the reason we haven't appealed or cancelled contracts or
    whatever for these sales is that WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE
    DECISION. There are lots of stories and discussions about the
    situation turning really nasty if the murrelet trees start being
    logged. But the other issue - geographic sales - i s considered
    past history by now.
    Hope this helps w/context.
