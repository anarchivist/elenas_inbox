TEXT:
A few interesting things came out of the OMB civil rights cross cut
meeting with Raines:

1. There is still no difference on theme with us (compliance, data,
technology, ADR).

2. OMB is vetting our specific additional ideas for another $20 million
in these areas, and Mary and I are trying to set other performance goals
as we discussed in our team leaders meeting and see what resources might
be needed to meet them.

3. Judy Winston sent Raines a note. Of interest, she said PIR is likely
to send "a general recommendation to the President for increased funding
as well as better data collection". She also suggested OMB: should add
something on coordination (which we are pushing DOJ to come up with a $
estimate on), push DOJ to formulate an "aggressive, proactive strategy"
for police brutality, add money for the community relations service, and
that OMB's should restore its civil rights budget analysis.  I'm sending y
ou a copy of her note.

FYI. Raines has what I understand to be a general review meeting with his
staff of "Presidential intiatives" tomorrow.
