                                WHITE HOUSE DRUG CZAR BARRY McCAFFREY,
                                MISSISSIPPI ATTORNEY GENERAL MIKE MOORE
                                        SPEAK OUT ON GATEWAY LINK
                                 BETWEEN YOUTH SMOKING AND DRUG USE

                           (BILOXI, Miss.) -- Youth smoking plays a dangerous role in leading to more dangerous,
                  illicit drugs, Barry R. McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and
                  Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore said today after a meeting in Biloxi.

                         "We need to fight gateway behaviors like smoking," McCaffrey said. "Many kids get on
                  the addiction expressway with cigarettes and end up crashing with heroin or cocaine. It's
                  irresponsible drug policy to stand up for youth cigarette use."

                          "I am very pleased that the nation's Drug Czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, is speaking out on
                  the correlation between youth smoking and the usage of other drugs," Moore said. "My entire
                  20-year career has been focused on educating kids about the dangers of using alcohol, tobacco
                  and other illicit drugs."

                         Every day, 3,000 children start smoking; 1,000 of them will die because of it. Children
                  who smoke cigarettes are more than 2.5 times more likely to use drugs than those who do not
                  smoke. Recent studies also show a "reverse gateway" effect with cigarettes: increasing numbers
                  of young people, predominately minorities, are now using cigarettes to prolong marijuana highs.

                          "By targeting youth smoking, we can reduce youth drug use before it starts," McCaffrey
                  said. "Studies show that if we can get children to age 21 without them starting addictive
                  behaviors, like cigarettes, they will probably never experience an addiction problem -- and that
                  includes drugs like heroin and cocaine."

                          The Administration has a five-part counter-tobacco plan to reduce youth smoking: raise
                  the price of cigarettes; full authority to FDA to regulate tobacco products; change the way the
                  industry does business; progress on the public health front; and protect farmers and communities.

                          "Not only is selling tobacco products to kids illegal -- just like pushing any other illegal
                  drug -- but youth smoking plays a role in other more dangerous behaviors," McCaffrey said. "No
                  one committed to fighting drugs like marijuana and heroin can in good conscience stand up for
                  tobacco and smoking among our children."

                                                                 ###
