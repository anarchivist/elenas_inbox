TEXT:
Just fyi -- we're ready to go anytime on the three directives.   For one,
we're working on some operational matters -- i.e., how we would really
proceed once the directive is given -- which we don't really need to work
out before the annoucement. We will also need to do the ww circulation.
But for scheduling purposes you should consider them ready whenever they
may be handy.

(The issue, fyi, involves the SSA's Death Files. The directive would make
it available to the Food Stamp program so they can be sure no deceased
persons are receiving Food Stamps.   SSA would prefer to give the data file
to USDA or to the states; USDA was hoping the states could send their Food
Stamp data to SSA and have SSA run the matches.   SSA would do it either
way, but they prefer not the be responsible for the extra administrative
burden, etc., and are concerned about the long run implications of beco
ming the national source for all such actions. There are actually four
possible options, and I'm having the agencies give me short memos on the
pros and cons of each and will hold a meeting on Monday Aug 31st.)
