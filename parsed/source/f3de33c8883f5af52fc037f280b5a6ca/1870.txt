TEXT:
At last, we have some modest progress on this.  You may recall that a TV
producer from the Summit had the bright idea of asking a bunch of young
poets and playwrights to draft the declaration of commitment that all the
Presidents will be asked to sign at the Summit.  But happily their product
was off-base enough that it will probably just be delivered as a letter to
the Presidents from the young people.

Therefore, the TV producer has taken a shot at it (below), as has Bush's
person. Our current plan, since time is short, is to have a conference
call tomorrow with Communications and Harris to agree among ourselves on a
draft; and then have Harris forward that to the Summit as his own draft.
The Summit people will give it to Powell, Bush, Ray Chambers, us, etc. for
comments on Monday.  Presumably then we will have a negotiating session.

Bruce and Jonathan, let me know if you want to be in on the conference
call tomorrow.  I don't know the time yet.  Or if you had time to play
with this Monday morning and email it to me, that would be great.

Here are the 2 versions:

TV producer:  "In accordance with the principles set forth in America's
Promise [this is the name of Powell's SOlc3, so there's probably a legal
issue here], namely that all young Americans be afforded A Healthy Start,
Safe Places, A Relationship With a Caring Adult, An Opportunity for
Community Service and the Tools to Develop a Marketable Skill, we the
undersigned citizens of the United States of America do hereby affirm our
commitment to achieving these goals."

Bush guy:  "I promise to do my best to help every young person in America
achieve [the 5 goals of the Summit, listed above -- caring adult, healthy
start, etc.].

We need to inject more strongly the concept of citizen service, both as a
way to get things done and to strengthen communities and democracy.  There
is no way to drop the 5 goals for children.  (In fact, Ray Chambers will
probably push for the text to include Powell's goal of reaching 2 million
children by the year 2000.)
