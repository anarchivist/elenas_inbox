For Immediate Release
April 29, 1999


STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

I am disappointed that so few states are devoting tobacco settlement funds
to reducing youth smoking, as shown by the new report from the Campaign
for Tobacco Free Kids and the American Heart Association.  This new report
underscores why I strongly oppose any legislation waiving the federal
governmentD,s claim to tobacco settlement funds without a commitment from
the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts.   In the absence of
such a commitment, states wonD,t have to spend a single penny of the $246
billion tobacco settlement to reduce youth smoking. We must act now:
every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1,000 will have their
lives cut short as result.
