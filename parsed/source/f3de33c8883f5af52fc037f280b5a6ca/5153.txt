       Groups fight Clinton pick for health job

                            By Michael Kranish, Globe Staff, 11/04/97

                              WASH'INGTON - Dr. Susan Jane Blumenthal, who is
       President
                                  Clinton's newly named senior adviser on women's
       health, is at the
                            center of a bitter fight being waged by prominent breast
       cancer groups,
                            which say she has her own agenda and should not get the
       post.

                         "She is the wrong person for this job, " said Frances
       M. Visco, president of
                         the National Breast 'Cancer Coalition, which represents
       400 cancer
                         organizations. "This person is totally inappropriate
       and harmful to this issue."

                         Visco said yesterday that the women's health community
       has tried for years
                         to bring its concerns about Blumenthal to members of
       Congress. But Visco
                         said Congress did not want to address the issue because
       Blumenthal is the
                         wife of Representative Edward J. Markey, the influential
       Malden, Mass.,


                    Democrat.

                  Blumenthal, in   an int'erview yesterday, said she has been
unfairly attacked for
                  carrying out a   congressional mandate requiring her to
spend cancer research
                  money in a way   opposed by Visco. For example, Blumenthal
said she wants
                  to spend money   for outreach to minorities, a move she
said her critics
                  opposed.

                   "This has become a very personal feud,"   said
Blumenthal, a clinical
                   professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University School
of Medicine. " I t is
                   not about breast cancer anymore. This has spun out of c
ontrol.' ,

                   Whichever side'is right, the prospect that the
president's chief advocate for
                   women's health is in a dispute with her own constituency
- women's health
                   groups - has set the cancer research community abuzz.
Research advocates
                   expressed concern that the feud over how cancer money is
being spent will
                   detract attention from the fight against cancer itself.

                    The dispute over Blumenthal centers on her three-year
tenure as deputy
                    secretary for women's health at the Department of Health
and Human
                  Services. In that position, according to      a
                                                             report by the
steering committee of
                  the National Action plan on Breast Cancer, she promoted
her own agenda
                  in a "disheartening and disturbing"   manner.

                    Visco served with Blumenthal as co- chairwoman of the
breast cancer
                    steering committee. The panel was composed of government
and
                    private-sector members who developed, the National Action
Plan on Breast
                    Cancer. visco served as the private-sector chairwoman,
while Blumenthal
                    served as the government's chairwoman.

                  visco and Blumenthal repeatedly clashed/during their
service on the panel.
                  visco wanted available cancer funds to be spent on
research. visco said the
                  problem began when Blumenthal went to Congress and
secured $14.7
                  million in cancer funds for Blumenthal's office- money
that visco had hoped
                  would be directed for research.

                    "We felt betrayed by that,"   visco said.       "She wanted


this plan to get a lot of
                  money that would go to her office."

                     Visco said she and other private-sector advocates went
to Congress and
                  argued that the money was not needed for Blumenthal's
office. Visco said a
                  deal was eventually broke red that sent most of the money
to the National
                  Cancer Institute.

                     Joanne Howes, a public policy consultant who represents
numerous
                     women's health groups, said the dispute has rankled many
women's heal th
                     organizations. Blumenthal "has been a divisive force in
the women's health
                     community,"   Howes said.

                     The dispute, which has been bubbling over the past year,
surfaced publicly
                     recently when the steering committee issued a report
that charged
                  Blumenthal' 'ignored the committee's intent"  to send
the $14.7 million to the
                  National Cancer Institute. The committee members said
Blumenthal failed to
                  consult with them before deciding how the money should
be spent.

                     "Dr. Blumenthal's disregard of process in this matter
and her continuing
                     tendency to promote the Office of Women's Health agenda
    is disturbing
                   and disheartening, " according to an Aug. 5 report app
roved by the steering
                   committee. "This most recent example of disregard for
and obstruction of
                   intent has seriously eroded the trust, confidence and
enthusiasm that are
                   integral to this partnership."

                  The report said this action resulted in "diverted
funding from peer-reviewed
                  breast cancer research ... violation of procedure ...
and an inappropriate use
                  of National Action Plan on Breast Cancer Research."

                     The dispute is basically about Visco and other advocates
wanting to spend
                   the money on cancer research, while Blumenthal said
Congress had directed
                   that some of the funds be spent on outreach and other
programs. In the end,
                   Blumenthal said about $10 million of the $14.7 million
went for cancer
                   research at the National Cancer Institute, $3 million
went to other federal
                   agencies, and $1 million stayed at Blumenthal's Office
of Women's Health.



                     Blumenthal's supporters said yesterday tha't they were
bewildered. Dr.
                   Deborah Davis, a World Resources Institute official who
has worked closely
                  with Blumenthal and the breast cancer advocates for sever
al years, said
                   Blumenthal' 'has done a really terrific job."

                     Davis said she believes the dispute may be a symptom of
"the tremendous
                  pain that many people function under with the threat of
the disease. I cannot
                  give you any rationalization for the enmity that has
developed. ' ,

                   The dispute, ,which has been the subject of stories in a
newsletter called The
                   Cancer Letter, gained more visibility yesterday when it
was also in The
                   Chronicle of Higher Education. The Chronicle report said
unnamed scientists
                   thought Blumenthal "was trying to take credit for the
work of others" by
                   soliciting papers that would be rewritten by
Blumenthal's office. The
                   newspaper said this matter was under investigation by
the HHS inspector
                   general.

                  Blumenthal, who also is an assistant surgeon general and
rear admiral in the
                  us Public Health Service, said, in the interview that she
was not aware of an
                  inspector general investigation. "Questions have been
raised, but there is no
                  investigation I am aware of."

                     Clinton announced on Sept. 30 that Blumenthal would
become his senior
                     adviser on women's health on Nov. 1. Blumenthal is on
vacation for two
                     weeks and an HHS spokesman said the appointment is "on
hold"   at least
                     until she returns .
