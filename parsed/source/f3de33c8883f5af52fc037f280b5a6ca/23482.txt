PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON HATE CRIMES
ROOSEVELT ROOM
THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON, D.C.
April 6, 1999

        Ever since I became President, I have tried to stress to the
American people we can no longer draw' sharp lines between domestic and
foreign affairs.  In an age when information and capital, products and
people, flow across borders with ever-greater ease and speed, there is a
profound link between what we do at home and what we do abroad.

        Today, I want to talk to you about new steps I am taking to
prevent hate-inspired acts of violence here in America. But I also want
to make clear that these steps must be seen as part of a larger global
challenge that we face as we approach the 21st Century. Today, in Kosovo,
thousands and thousands of families are being driven from their ancestral
homes at the point of a gun, and many are being murdered, all because of
their ethnicity and religion.  Today, brave American men and women,
working with our NATO allies, are striking back at the forces committing
these terrible acts--the forces of Slobodan Milosevic.  Mr. Milosevic is
responsible for this crisis.  He can end it, now, by withdrawing his
military, police and paramilitary forces from Kosovo; by accepting the
deployment of an international security force; and by making it possible
for all refugees to return as we move towards a political framework for
Kosovo based on the Rambouillet accords.

        It is a sad to think that on the eve of a new millennium, there
are still people .who allow their own self-worth to be determined by who
they are not; who think less about lifting themselves up than of holding
others down; and who insist that the ethnic and religious identities of
others are somehow a threat to their own. This kind of thinking is
particularly tragic when you consider that in the era we have entered,
diversity can be one of the greatest sources strength.   It is no small
irony that while Mr. Milosevic has impoverished Yugoslavia by pulling it
apart along ethnic lines, much of the rest of Europe has been growing more
prosperous by coming together economically and politically.   Bosnia is
increasingly governed not by the forces of ethnic hate, but by elected
officials aided by a multinational force speaking different languages yet
united in common purpose. And a key part of that force are U.S. soldiers
who themselves represent every conceivable ethnic and religious
background, but who also comprise the mightiest fighting force the world
has ever known.

        If the end of the 20th Century teaches anything it is that
diversity can be manipulated into tragedy, or nurtured into a source of
strength. Neither course is inevitable. That is why we have a real
interest in nourishing tolerance and fighting violent intolerance, abroad
as well as at home.  In recent months, we have all been horrified by
brutal acts of hate here in the U.S..  These crimes strike at the heart of
I'



what it means to be an American. They challenge the values that define us
as a nation. They threaten the peaceable diversity that underpins our
strength and prosperity.  We must reaffirm that we will not tolerate such
acts.

        Since I convened the first White House conference on hate crimes a
year and a half ago, we have substantially increased the number of FBI
agents devoted to hate crimes. We have successfully prosecuted a number
of serious hate crime cases. And we have formed local hate cri"mes working
groups in U.S. AttorneyO,s offices around the country, to coordinate
training and prevention efforts among federal, state, local law
enforcement officials.

        But we must do more.  Over 8000 hate crime incidents were reported
in 1997, the latest year for which FBI figures are available. That is
nearly one hate crime every hour. We must do more to fight hate crimes
now and prevent them in the future by reaching out to our young people.
Today, I am pleased to announce important new steps to do just that.

        First, I am calling upon the Departments of Justice and Education to
include in their annual report card on school safety crucial information
on hate crimes among young people, both at and away from school.   Second,
I am directing the Department of Education, with assistance from the
Department of Justice, to collect data, for the first time, important on
hate crimes and bias on college campuses.

        Third,   I am very pleased to announce a new public-private
partnership to help reach middle school students with the message of
tolerance. Like any value, tolerance must be taught, nurtured, and
encouraged.    That is the aim of the partnership, which includes AT&T,
Court TV, the National Middle School Association, the Anti-Defamation
League, and Cable in the Classroom, with assistance from the Departments
of Education and Justice. The partnership will develop fresh new outreach
methods, from in-school lessons to cable TV programs and websites.
        Fourth, I calIon Congress to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.      Our
Federal laws already punish some crimes committed against people on the
basis of race or religion or national origin, but we should do more.    This
crucial legislation would strengthen and expand the ability of the Justice
Department to prosecute hate crimes by removing needless jurisdictional
requirements for existing crimes and by giving Federal prosecutors the
power to prosecute hate crimes committed because of the victim's sexual
orientation, gender, or disability. All Americans
deserve protection from hate.    Congress missed an opportunity to pass
this crucial legislation last year.    Congress should not miss that
opportunity this year.

        As important as it is to pass a new hate crimes law, we must ultimately
do more: we must be reconciled to one another. We must believe in one
another's fundamental humanity.   So often today America faces the
challenge of helping to prevent conflicts overseas, fueled by divisions of
race, ethnicity, and religion.   We cannot meet these challenges abroad
unless we have healed our divisions at home.
