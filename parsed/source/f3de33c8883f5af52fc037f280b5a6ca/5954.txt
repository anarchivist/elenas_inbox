Thought you might be interested in this note from Steven Levy in light of
the story in the Post this morning about helping to prepare people for
high tech jobs.  He's with the Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy.  He is promoting the idea that we need to look at
workforce policy in an integrated way, i.e. by finding ways to help move
people into jobs at the upper end of the ladder, we also create
opportunities for welfare recipients and others at the entry level.   I
have his 8/97 briefing report called "The California Economy and
Developing Annual Goals for Moving Welfare Recipients into the Workforce"
if anyone wants to see it.

Subject: NGA forum followup

Dear Andrea,

I am writing in the hopes of starting a dialogue on workforce preparation
strategies as a continuation to the discussions at the NGA Forum.

Our organization is working with The California Wellness Foundation on a
multi-year effort on the future of work and health in California.   We also
participated in the Rockefeller Foundation supported study which I sent you
and will be addressing a much larger multi-foundation conference in
California
in February on these issues.

Our general hypothesis is that the fortunes of all groups in the workforce
are
linked and that effective workforce preparation and economic development
strategies must address all labor force groups simultaneously (i.e.,


universal workforce policies) for both technical and constituency building
reasons.  In California's polciy debate that led to the idea that funding
training for existing workers to move up to fill shortages identified by
businesses was, ipart of the policy mix to help welfare recipients -and the
working poor.

Also, as we said in the paper that I sent you,  we believe that the real
debate about welfare reform will start when the next economic slowdown
occurs
and taht the issue will be revisitied by Congress.

I would love to get your insights to help our Wellness work, particularly
on
where in the country states or people are recognizing this "connectedness"
point in developing workforce strategies.

Steve Levy
