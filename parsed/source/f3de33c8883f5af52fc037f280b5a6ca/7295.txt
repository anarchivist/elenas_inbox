TEXT:
A few things:

In Answer #1 (to the Satcher question), I would say "without encouraging
drug use" instead of "increasing" - it may be a fine line, but
"encouraging" is used in the law and there's reason for using it and not
increasing.

In Answer #2 (to the Solomon Amendment): I am not sure I would argue that
what the Solomon bill seeks to do is politicizing the issue - I'm not sure
it would pass the snicker test. Rather, can't we say that we agree with
what Congress had done in leaving the decisions on the scientific
questions around needle exchange to the Secretary, and the decisions on
which prevention strategies to use in the hands of state and local folks.
I'd suggest something like:

"We believe that the purpose of this legislation is an attempt by a few
members of Congress to grandstand on a very difficult but important
issue.   We think Congress did the right thing when it gave the Secretary
of HHS the authority to answer the scientific questions around these
programs. And we think that State and local officials now need to decide
whether these programs are right for their communities."

This is also consistent with the SAP on which we've been working.  By the
way, you should see the letter McAffrey sent to Sandy on Friday.  I'll
show it to you tomorrow.

Todd

Yes, you should.  This is only a problem if we just don't have any time
(as we didn't today). Do you have any suggested changes?
