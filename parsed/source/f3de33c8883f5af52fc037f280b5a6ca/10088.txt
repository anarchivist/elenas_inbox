Susan Haney               OFFICIALS, IT'S A DISTURBING AND
George Washington Univ.   INCREASINGLY FAMILIAR SIGHT

:22 -    :26              staff, faculty,   even other
students
Christine Ramelli         report that they feel that they
are
                          surrounded by smokers more than
they
:31 -    :35              used to be.
Bob Kur
NBC News                  ACCORDING TO THE LONG-TERM
                          NATIONAL STUDY DUE OUT TODAY--IT'S
:53 -    :57              MORE THAN A FEELING. IT'S FACT:
Lara Degem                A "DRAMATIC INCREASE" IN SMOKING
AMONG
                          COLLEGE STUDENTS.
1:11 - 1:15
Christopher Stanley       its just habit, you try to quit a
lot
                          and you just get mad at pepole.     i
                          throw fits when i try to quit.
the
                          nicotine is really addictive.


                          THE TREND ON CAMPUS IS ESPECIALLY
                          WORRISOME BECAUSE COLLEGE-BOUND
HIGH
                          SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
=LESS=
                          =LIKELY TO SMOKE= THAN THOSE WHO
DON'T
                          GO TO COLLEGE.

                          BUT NOW:
                          MANY =MORE= STUDENTS SMOKE FOR THE
                          =FIRST= TIME AFTER THET GET TO
COLLEGE.
                          =WHAT'S MORE--=A HIGHER
PERCENTAGE OF
                          COLLEGE FRESHMAN =ALREADY= =ARE
SMOKERS
                          =WHEN THEY ARRIVE.




                          i'm addicted (she laughs)
                          i'm well aware it's not good for
me.
                          at a younger age, i don't think i
care
                          about it all that much.

                          (nat sot)
                          the tobacco industry. they have
50 ways
                          to kill your loved ones



                                               AND--WHY DON'T ANTI-TOBACCO ADS
                                               AND PUBLICITY GET THROUGH?

                                               well, because i'm kind of
    skeptical
                                               because i   see it more as a
    political
                                               battle between the government and
    big
                                               tobacco businesses.

                                               SOME COLLEGES HAVE BANNED SMOKING
    IN
                                               DORMS AND OTHER AREAS ...

                                               AND AT SOME CAMPUS CLINICS,
    OFFICIALS
                                               TRY TO PERSUADE STUDENTS TO
                                               QUIT ... OFTEN WITHOUT SUCCESS .

                                              . they feel it really helps them
    when
                                               they are under academic pressure
    and
                                               personal pressure. it's also a
    time of
                                               experimentation.

                                               WITH SMOKING,   IT'S
    EXPERIMENTATION THAT
                                               ONCE BEGAN MAINLY IN HIGH SCHOOL,
    BUT
                                               NO MORE.
