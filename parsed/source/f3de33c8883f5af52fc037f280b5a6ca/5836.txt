                                     DATE:January 6, 1998
                                     TIME:       11:15 am - 12:00 pm

                                                 Gene Sperling

L     PURPOSE:

      To announce your proposal to enable Americans under 65 years old to obtain Medicare
      benefits.

II.   BACKGROUND:

      Americans ages 55 to 65 are one of the most difficult to insure populations. They have
      less access to employer-based health insurance and they are twice as likely to have health
      problems -- making insurance unaffordable and, in many cases, putting them at risk of
      losing their coverage altogether. Many lose their insurance coverage because their spouse
      becomes eligible for Medicare, or they lose their jobs due to company downsizing or
      plant closings, and still others lose insurance when their retiree health coverage is dropped
      unexpectedly. These older Americans are often left to buy into the individual insurance
      market, which can be prohibitively expensive, particularly if a person has a preexisting
      condition. The number of Americans facing these problems will increase dramatically as
      the baby boomers approach age 65.

      You will be proposing new measures to allow Americans under age 65 to buy into the
      Medicare Program. The new participants in the Medicare Program would pay higher
      premiums in order to finance the proposal, however, to implement the policy would cost
      approximately $2 billion over 5 years. These costs mostly represent Medicare's "loan" to
      the 62 to 65 population which is paid back over time. To temporarily offset this loan,
      the budget will include a series of new Medicare anti-fraud and waste proposals.

      To address this problem, your proposal will provide greater access to health coverage by:



                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
      PROGRAM, by paying a premium. The premium would be fixed at an affordable cost
      of about $300 per month -- based on the average cost of insuring Americans this age
      range. These premiums will be particularly affordable to people with some type of
      health problem, whose preexisting conditions make individual insurance extremely
      expensIve.

      To offset these additional costs, participants would pay an additional monthly payment of
      about $50 added to their regular premium when they enter Medicare at 65. This two
      part "payment plan" enables these older Americans to buy into Medicare at an affordable
      premium, while ensuring they do not burden the Medicare program over the long run.

      PROVIDING DISPLACED WORKERS OVER 55 ACCESS TO MEDICARE.
      Older Americans who have been involuntarily displaced from jobs and lost their health
      care coverage as a result would be able to buy into the Medicare Program.

      Older Americans have a harder time finding new employment if they are laid off. Only 52
      percent of such workers are reemployed compared to over 70 percent of younger
      workers. Moreover, nearly half of those unemployed, displaced workers who had health
      insurance remained uninsured.

      GIVING ACCESS TO EMPLOYER-BASED HEALTH COVERAGE FOR AMERICANS
      OVER 55 WHOSE COMPANIES RENEGED ON THEIR COMMITMENT TO
      PROVIDE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS. This proposal allows these retirees to buy
      into their former employers' health plan through age 65 by extending the availability of
      COBRA coverage to these families.

      In recent years, the number of companies offering retiree benefits has declined: in 1993,
      only about half of full-time' workers in medium to large firms had access to retiree health
      insurance, compared to 75 percent in 1985. Some companies have ended coverage for
      future retirees, but some workers have undergone the unfortunate experience of having
      their companies unexpectedly drop their health care coverage after they have retired.
      This policy provides much needed access to affordable health care for these retirees and
      their dependents whose health care coverage is eliminated after they have retired.

      has since had a $14,000 heart operation.                                    .
