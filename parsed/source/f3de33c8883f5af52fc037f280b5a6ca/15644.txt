                                STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT                    Hex-Dump Conversion

        Today, I have approved H.R. 911, the "Volunteer Protection Act of 1997," which will

provide volunteers working for non-profit and governmental entities certain protections from

civil liability. Citizen service is the main way we recognize that we are responsible for one

another, that we are members of a true community, with all of us working together.

Governments at all levels must encourage all our citizens to volunteer for service. This bill is a

small part of what the federal government is doing to help people serve.

        H.R. 911 is a limited and targeted bill that deals with the specific concerns of individuals

serving our communities without compensation. It preserves for the states, the traditional source

of tort law, not only the ability to opt out of the bill's provisions entirely, but also the right to

require proper licensing and evidence of financial responsibility. It is important that none of the

bill's limitations on liability will apply to misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, an act

of international terrorism, a hate crime, or to any misconduct that involves intoxication, drug use,

a sexual offense or the violation of any State or Federal civil rights laws, or to actions on behalf

of any organization that engages in hate cnmes. Anyone hurt by a negligent volunteer will have

recourse against the organization for whom the volunteer was working.

        I remain concerned, however, that H.R. 911 contains both an absolute prohibition on joint

and several liability for non-economic damages and elements of one-way preemption. These are

both modifications of tort law that make it harder for innocent injured parties to recover. I

emphasize that my signing this specialized and limited bill designed to promote individual

citizen service in no way mitigates my opposition to these modifications if they were to be

applied more generally. A prohibition on joint and several liability for non-economic damages

hurts those least able to recover on their own -- poor, sick and older Americans. One-way

preemption usurps state prerogatives to balance the rights and responsibilities of plaintiffs and
                                                               Automated Records Management System
    defendants.                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

           On balance, however, H.R. 911 will encourage service without unduly impacting the

    rights of citizens who benefit from such service. I am pleased to sign the bill.
