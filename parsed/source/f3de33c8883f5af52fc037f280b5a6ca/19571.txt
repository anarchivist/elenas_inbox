TEXT:
This is a more formal list of people our office would call (than what I
scribbled yesterday) :
NCLR--Charles Kamasaki, Raul Yzaguirre
MALDEF--Antonia Hernandez
LULAC--Brent Wilkes, Belen Robles
Hispanic Education Coalition--(Maritza could schedule a quick conference
call
Karen Narasaki/Daphne Kwok--Asian advocates
Jim Lyons--NABE
Deborah Escobedo--education advocate--calif
HACU--Antonio Flores/Jacobo Fraire
Ana Guzman--Commission on Hispanic Education/Sarita Brown
Monica Lozano--La Opinion

Folks--we still don't have closure on how and when the President will
articulate his views? Elena--will you be staying on top of this??
