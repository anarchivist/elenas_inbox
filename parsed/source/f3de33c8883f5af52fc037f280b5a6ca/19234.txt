TEXT:
Even though we have backed off on the data collection component of the
equal pay initiative, I called Sue Missinger of the Society of Human
Resource Managers in order to get a quick read from the business community
on their concerns about pay equity.  She stated that the business       .
community hadn't really focused on the bills because their sense was that
the legislation was not moving. When I asked her about penalties, she
said that businesses would not support uncapped penalties, but she was not
as adamant on this point as she was about some other issues.

Her two main concerns seemed to be on issues other than those included in
our announcement. They were:    (1) that OFCCP does not really have the
authority to require federal contractors to supply wage data currently and
(2) that they have major problems with OFCCP's proposed new rule to
require wage data on the affirmative action summary (which is still being
vetted at the department and has not been sent to OMB yet) .
