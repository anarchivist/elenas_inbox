TEXT:
potus checked the "approve" box on today's eo, but also wrote a note
saying "before execute [sic] have podesta talk to me" - - so we're holding
off for a bit until john's had an opportunity to do so; might also want to
be a bit cautious with the press paper/remarks, though i think in the end
we're still on track and there's no big issue - - someone (if john cant
do it beforehand) ought to explore the president's question/concern in the
prebrief.
