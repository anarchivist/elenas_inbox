The votes are in.   After going into the weekend neck and neck, Word

Perfect

rolled ahead on the "all change is bad" campaign.    A key turning point was

Bruce Reed's comment that Microsoft Word and Word Perfect were, in his

view,

"virtually identical, but ... (Microsoft) Word has a handful of annoying

features."



The argument from Microsft Word supporters that we should switch because

the

rest of the country is moving in that direction created little support.

Jose

Cerda's view that we should support the monopolization of the computer

world

because the information revolution is based on different economic

principles


than the industrial revolution, was also a non-starter.



Tom Freedman, leader of the Microsoft Word coalition was unavailable for

comment.
