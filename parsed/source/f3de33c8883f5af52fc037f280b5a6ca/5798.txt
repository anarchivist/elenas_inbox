                      PRESIDENT WILLIAM J.CLINTON
              RADIO ADDRESS ON MEDICARE CANCER SCREENING
                             December 27, 1997

       Good morning. The holidays are a time when families come together to celebrate
the season with love. And they remind us of our bonds of duty to care for one another.
Today, I would like to talk to you about how we are enlarging the blanket of Medicare
protection to honor our parents and grandparents in important new ways in the new year.

       Looking back over 1997, it's clear that we achieved major reforms of the Medicare
system that will help Americans live healthier, happier, and longer lives. This year's
bipartisan balanced budget agreement reaff"rrmed our commitment to preserving and
strengthening Medicare. We extended the life ofthe Medicare TrusfFund until at least
2010. We made Medicare protection more affordable for low-income Americans. We.
modernized the Medicare system by expanding choice, injecting competition, and
controlling costs. And we created a blue-ribbon commission that will examine ways in
which we can ensure that Medicare will serve baby boomers and our children as well as it
has our parents.

       Now, we will begin the New Year by implementing expanded Medicare benefits so
that they provide greater protection to Americans in our fight against cancer. That's why,
on New Year's Day, we will introduce a series of changes in Medicare that will make
screening, prevention, and detection of cancer more affordable and frequent. We are
ringing in the New Year resolved to take new steps in our battle against cancer - one of
mankind's oldest foes.

        First, for the first time, we will guarantee the option of annual mammograms for
every woman over 40. And, by waiving the deductible, we will make annual breast cancer
screenings more affordable. By making mammograms more accessible and detecting
cancer earlier, we can significantly increase the likelihood of successful treatment for this
disease. And I would like to thank Hillary for alerting us to the barriers that keep nearly
half of women from getting regular mammograms and for her long-standing campaign to
encourage older women to get these crucial tests.

       Second, we are expanding coverage for the early detection of cervical cancer. We
have sophisticated tests to pick up early signs of cervical cancer and, from now on,
Medicare will pay for regular access to this life-saving technology.

       And third, for the first time, we will now cover regular examinations for colorectal
cancer. MostAmericans don't get this important preventive test, but when we catch this
cancer early, we can beat it more than 90% of the time.

       Nearly every family has been touched by the hand of cancer. My own mother

year. And that's why these actions are so important. By detecting cancer early on, we
offer our loved ones the greatest gifts of aU - the gifts of life, of health, and of many
holidays to come.

        Thank's for listening. Happy Holidays and have a happy -- and healthy - New
Year.

                                             ###
