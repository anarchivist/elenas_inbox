TEXT:
FYI -- Secretary Herman is meeting with reporters Wednesday at 11:30 as
part of her on-going welfare reform campaign.  I'm getting their entire
press packet -- so far I've seen their Q&As which are surprisingly on
message.

They are also preparing a publication for release in January which I need
to talk to them about.
