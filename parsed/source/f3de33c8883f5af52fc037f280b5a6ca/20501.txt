 TEXT:
 Mary and I are working on deliverables for the food safety radio address.
 The final juice rule looks to be the most promising at this point.  Here
 is what an outline of address might look like.


 Elements for Food Safety Radio Address:

 * We have made important strides in putting in place an effective, modern
 system to protect food safety

 * On Monday, we will finalize the rule requiring labels on unpasteurized
 fruit juices so parents can know what their children are drinking. This
 is important for children, and all consumers.  (or other announcement).

 *   But we have much to do.

 * Summer is the most dangerous time for food safety.

 * We have had serious outbreaks already this sUmmer. In Georgia and the
 midwest many people have gotten sick from e-coli and salmonella.

 * We urgently need to take the next steps in modernizing our food safety
 system. Especially we need to work to guarantee the safety of imported
 foods.

 * Unfortunately, the House took a step backward this week when it failed
 to appropriate funds for a comprehensive food safety plan, including funds
 for increased inspection of imported foods.

 * This should not be a Republican or Democratic issue.    It is a matter of
 protecting the safety of the food our familIes eat.

 * when the Senate takes this issue up later this month, I urge them to do
 the right thing and invest in improving our food safety system.

 Other.



  We'll forward a list of other options for announcements.  In addition to
  the budget, we could also push for passage of a bill to give USDA the
  authority to recall tainted meat.
