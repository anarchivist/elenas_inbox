TEXT:
The House Appropriations Committee expects to mark up the supplemental
bill tomorrow (Thursday, 3/11) at 1:00pm.  Therefore, we need to release
the letter tomorrow morning. Need WW decision on level of veto threat:


"Were the bill to be presented to the President with the offsets discussed
above, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State would
recommend that he veto the bill." Please provide comments/clearance by
lOam tomorrow.  Thank you.

The Honorable C.W. Bill Young
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
u.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
views on the bill making emergency supplemental appropriations to assist
in Central AmericaD,s recovery from recent natural disasters, to provide
urgent funding related to the situation in Jordan, and to provide vital
loans and other assistance to our farmers and ranchers.  The
Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s prompt action on the
PresidentD,s supplemental requests and looks forward to working with the
Committee on a bi-partisan basis on this important legislation. However,
we have significant concerns with the approach being taken in the
Committee amendment. As the Committee develops its version of the bill,
we ask that you consider the AdministrationD,s views.

        Providing essential assistance to victims of natural disasters and
assisting our farmers at home with vital financing clearly fall in the
category of needs that are urgent, unanticipated, and essential    that
is, emergency requirements. Therefore, they ~learly deserve to be funded
quickly, fully, and without requiring offsets that could force
unacceptable reductions in important programs. We support the
CommitteeD,s action of providing defense-related emergency funding in
response to Hurricane Mitch without offsets and believe that consistent
treatment should be applied to 'non-defense related emergency
requirements.

         It is our understanding that the Committee may propose rescinding
nearly $1 billion from international affairs accounts, with the largest
portion being a rescission of $748 million in appropriations of callable
capital from early U.S. payments to the Asian Development Bank (ASDB), the
World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank.    Such rescissions
would be extremely ill-advised.    Rescinding the callable capital funding
would send the wrong signal to financial markets and could require the
AS DB and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to pay a premium on
their borrowing, which would lead to the restriction of capital flows
necessary to strengthen the global economy and expand u.S, exports, At a
time when some Asian and other developing economies are beginning to
recover, this step would be highly unproductive.

        In addition, this rescission of callable capital would make
additional appropriations of callable capital to the MDBs vulnerable to
future rescissions as well and thereby call into question u.S. commitment
to all multilateral development banks.   This could have a detrimental
effect on capital flows and economic growth globally, including in Asia,
Africa, and Latin America. This unintended consequence would even more
broadly delay economic recovery in markets vital to the United States.

        The other possible rescissions in the international affairs area
would undermine a host of important objectives in many programs.  For
example, the rescissions would cut support for U.S. exports, undermining


 our efforts to penetrate foreign markets and provide jobs for American
 workers.   At a time when the United States needs to promote its exports,
 this is a particular misguided step. The rescissions would also undercut
 free market reform and democracy promotion in the New Independent States
 and in Eastern Europe, areas where it is manifestly in AmericaD, s                           \\
 interests to encourage reform.  The rescission of development assistance
 would set back efforts in the poorest countries, including possibly in
 those hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.

         Other rescissions would undermine our efforts to provide
 peacekeeping operations in troubled areas of the world.   The rescission
 of Global Environment Facility funding would be highly detrimental to the
 cause of improving global environmental protection. Still other ~uts
 would reduce our contributions to international organizations, where
 AmericaD,s reputation as a contributor in good standing is already
 tarnished.  Rescissions also would be made against critical efforts to
 halt proliferation and to counter terrorism, areas where America cannot
 afford to be pulling back.

         Taken together, these rescissions are so great that the
 suppl~mental as a whole would constitute a net reduction in U.S. foreign
 affairs spending -- a reduction that would seriously undermine AmericaD,s
 capacity to pursue its foreign policy objectives.

         We have concerns with other offsets in the bill, such as a
 proposed $150 million cut in important nonproliferation programs and
 regional peacekeeping activities in Russia.

         [Were the bill to be presented to the President with the   offsets
discussed above, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary    of State
would recommend that he veto the bill.]   We urge you not to take   actions
that could result. in gridlock and that would be detrimental both   to our
allies abroad and our citizens at home in their time of need.

 Emergency Relief for Central America

        On February 16th, the President transmitted to the Congress a
request for $956 million for International Assistance Programs, the
Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice to provide assistance
for emergency disaster and reconstruction assistance expenses arising from
the consequences of the recent hurricanes in Central America and the
Caribbean and the recent earthquake in Colombia.  The Administration
appreciates the full funding provided in the House bill for this request,
which will provide relief from the effects of Hurricanes Mitch and Georges
and restore hope to this devastated region.

        Hurricane Mitch, the worst natural disaster in the history of the Western
hemisphere, left more than 9,000 dead and drove millions from their
homes.  Even today, hundreds of thousands of Central Americans still
cannot return to their homes.  Schools, hospitals, businesses, farms and
roads were destroyed, resulting in serious economic dislocation.
Hurricane Mitch caused $8.5 billion in damages, and Hurricane Georges
brings the total to $10 billion.  The PresidentD,s Central America package
is urgent, unanticipated, and essential and should be funded as an
emergency request.

        Funds must be provided swiftly to prevent the spread of disease and to
buy seed and plant crops in the fast-approaching Spring planting season,
thereby providing food and jobs to many communities, and to demonstrate to
Central Americans that they can find jobs and security in their own


recovering economies. Much of the rural road system farmers and small
merchants depend on for their livelihoods was destroyed. Water and
sanitation systems have been disrupted, which can result in disease.
Economic destruction and dislocation threaten to undermine the regionO,s
achievements of the past decade, as these nations have made tremendous
strides toward settling conflicts, strengthening democracy, promoting
human rights, opening economies and alleviating poverty. Disaster
assistance will ensure that their transformation continues and that
Central Americans will have cause to view their own futures in the region
with hope.

Jordan

        The President submitted a request for $300 million in supplemental
and advance appropriations for Jordan on February 19th. These funds will
provide financial support to help promote stability in Jordan and the
region during the period of transition subsequent to King HusseinO,s
death.  While the Administration appreciates the full funding of the $100
million FY 1999 request, we are disappointed that the $200 million
requested for advance appropriations for FYs 2000 and 2001 has not been
provided.  In the context of promoting peace in the Middle East, the
Administration will continue to press for these advance appropriations.

Department of Agriculture

        On February 26th, the President submitted a request for $152
million for urgently needed emergency funds for the Department of
Agriculture. Forecasts for continuing low commodity prices in 1999 have
significantly increased the demand for Department of Agriculture farm
loans, as many farmers are being rejected by their regular sources of
financing.  The AdministrationO,s request would provide an additional $1.1
billion in farm ownership, operating, and emergency direct and guaranteed
loans to help farmers through the Spring planting season.  In addition,
the AdministrationO,s requested $43 million for Farm Service Agency
salaries and expenses would enable additional temporary employees to be
hired to speed assistance to farmers.  The President has asked the
Congress to act expeditiously on this request to ensure the availability
of the funding by the end of March. We urge the Committee to add these
urgently needed funds to the bill.

        In addition, we request that the Committee not add extraneous
authorizations to the bill, particularly narrow, objectionable riders that
would adversely affect the environment or serve only to generate
controversy, unnecessarily delaying the urgently needed emergency
assistance contained in this bill.

        We look forward to working with the Committee to address our
mutual concerns.


                                                Sincerely,



                                                Jacob J. Lew
