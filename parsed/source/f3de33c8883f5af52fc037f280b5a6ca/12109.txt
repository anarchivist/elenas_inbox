      Education could not commit to an "annual" report because they do not have
      funding for this -- so we should take out the word "annual."

MEMORANDUM FOR                THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
                              THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION


SUBJECT:               ANNUAL REPORTS ON HATE CRIMES IN SCHOOLS AND
                       COLLEGE CAMPUSES

       One of the greatest challenges facing this country is to ensure that all Americans share the
same opportunities, regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation,
gender, or disability.

        To meet this challenge, we must ensure that our nation's laws fully protect all its citizens.
 That is why I have called on Congress to enact legislation to strengthen existing federal hate
crimes laws by removing needless barriers to prosecuting violent crimes based on race, color,
religion, or national origin and expanding the law to cover acts of violence committed because of
a person's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. This legislation will assist us in responding
to the kind of heinous and cowardly hate crimes we have witnessed in the last year.

        At the same time, we must learn more about the prevalence of hate crimes and other acts
of intolerance -- especially among our young people, whose attitudes and experiences will shape
the America of the 21st century. In order to better understand the problem of hate crimes and
intolerance among young people, I call on the Departments of Justice and Education to include in
their annual report card on school safety a section on hate crimes among young people, both at
and away from school. In addition, I direct the Department of Education, with appropriate
assistance from the Department of Justice, to collect data on hate crimes and bias on college
campuses for publication in an annual report.

        These steps will help us better understand the problems of bigotry we face among young
people, and to improve the ways we respond to these problems, through improved curricula,
after-school youth programs, and the like. At the same time, our proposed legislation will
ensure that when hate crimes do occur, they are prosecuted as effectively as possible. I
appreciate your commitment to improving the enforcement of this nation's laws and to fighting
bigotry among young people and others, and I look forward to your continuing leadership in
these areas.
