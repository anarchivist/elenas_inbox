TEXT:
THE MORAL UP FRONT:    It's past 4:00 pm and I need all Daily Report briefs.

Once upon a time a hen was up in the branches of a tree, and a coyote came
up to her: "I've brought some good news for you. Do you want to hear it?"
asked the coyote.

"00 you really have some good news?" the hen asked.

The coyote answered: "It's about the two of us. Hear this: The coyote and
the hen have made peace! Now we're going to be friends and you can come
down from the tree. We'll hug each other as a sign of good will."

The hen kept asking if it was true what the coyote was saying: "Where was
the peace treaty approved, brother coyote?" The coyote answered:

"Over there by the hunting grounds on the other side of the mountain.
Hurry up and come down so that we can celebrate this moment of peace."

The hen asked:   "Over there on the other side of the mountain?"

"May God witness that I am telling the truth. Come on down from the tree,"
insisted the coyote.

"Maybe you are telling the truth, brother. I see that the dog is coming to
celebrate the fiesta with us, because you and he are also going to make
peace. I see him coming near, I hear him coming. He's coming fast and he's
going to grab me, now that you and he have made peace. Do you hear,
brother coyote, do you hear?" asked the hen. She was very happy and came
down from the branches of the tree.

The coyote accepted this explanation and ran away. As the hen said, the
dog was coming, that's why he left. The hen didn't want to come down from
the tree. She didn't fall in front of the coyote; if she had, he would
have eaten her. She realized he was just telling her lies.

Thus ends the story of the coyote and the hen.
