TEXT:
Next week, the House is expected to take up H.R. 4570 - Omnibus National
Parks and Public Lands Act of 1998.   Please review the joint
Interior/Agriculture letter with the position: Secretaries of Interior &
Agriculture and Chair of CEQ would recommend veto. We aim to release the
letter Monday afternoon in order to make an impact on the Hill.  If the
bill makes it to the House floor, it is likely that we will convert the
letter into a SAP.  Please provide comments/clearance by noon, Monday
(9/28). Thank you.

Honorable Don Young
Chairman
Committees on Resources
United States House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515



Dear Mr. Chairman:

We are writing to you regarding H.R. 4570, the "Omnibus National Parks and
Public Lands Act of 1998." H.R. 4570 is a compilation of many separate
bills that have, for the most part, been the subject of hearings and
markups in your Committee.

Over the course of the 105th Congress the Administration has expressed its
support for many provisions now included in H.R. 4570. These provisions
should be broken out and presented to the President as free standing
bills. Currently, this bill contains many provisions that the
Administration previously has made clear that it strongly opposes. These
provisions would cause serious damage to our natural resources by, among
other things, removing land from wilderness and other protective status to
facilitate road building, motorized access, and airport construction.

Indeed, we, along with the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality,
have previously informed the Committee that we would recommend to the
President that he veto several of the provisions of this bill, such as
those involving San Rafael Swell (Utah), congressional review of National
Monument designations, and a road easement for the Chugach Alaska
Corporation.

Morever, H.R. 4570 also includes provisions of H.R. 3830, a bill
introduced by Rep. Hansen, to ratify an exchange agreement between the
Department of the Interior and the State of Utah.   As you know, the
Admimistration strongly supports enactment of H.R. 3830. However, the
Secretary of the Interior made it clear in his testimony of May 19, 1998,
that

"Administration support [for H.R. 3830] is contingent on the passage of a
clean bill, with no amendments, riders, other objectionable legislation
attached. While I believe this is a good deal for the environment, the
taxpayers, and the school trust of Utah, I will have no hesitation about
recommending a veto if any objectionable provisions are attached in this
Congress."

Since this bill is now combined with other provisions that we cannot
support, we must inform you that the Administration is strongly opposed to
the enactment of H.R. 4570 and, if the bill is presented to the President
in its current form, we and the Chair of the Council of Environmental
Quality will recommend that he veto this legislation.


Sincerely,


        Secretary of the Interior               Secretary of Agriculture
