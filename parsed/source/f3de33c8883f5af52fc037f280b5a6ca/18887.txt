TEXT:
Crime -- Modified Assault Rifles:  Last November, you directed Secretary
Rubin to temporarily suspend the importation of certain modified assault
rifles while Treasury determined whether or not these rifles complied with
the "sporting purposes test" and could be legally imported under the Gun
Control Act of 1968.  Over the past few months, Treasury has studied the
features and uses of the 5 basic types of modified assault rifles, which
represent more than 50 specific models, and they are now at the point of
deciding whether a stronger case can be made to permanently ban from
importation the more than 30 AK-47- and Uzi-type models, which have
virtually no legitimate sporting purpose, or all five models, some of
which -- it can be argued -- have some marginal sporting use.  Treasury
may be ready to make its recommendation in time for next week's radio
address, which is the deadline for its review.
