TEXT:
I think it's a fabulous idea and it's right before the sotu, so why not
give it to Mrs. Gore--what is the VP going to be saying? Gene and
Elena--do you have any thoughts?

Maria --

I understand the Administration will seek a 100% increase in GEAR-UP
funding for FY 2000. Mrs. Gore's MLK speech will center around young
people and developing their ability to build One America.  In addition,
she is speaking in Philadelphia and Rep. Chaka Fattah is attending.   This
would be the ideal budget preview announcement for Mrs. Gore to make.   I
am checking on the specifics with Josh, however, is this something you all
are holding for the President to preview? If you are not, we would be
VERY interested in doing this.  Thank you.

P.S. Our team is snowed in New Hampshire this evening, however, I am
hoping to have a draft speech ready for circulation by early afternoon.     I
would appreciate any comments or suggestions.
