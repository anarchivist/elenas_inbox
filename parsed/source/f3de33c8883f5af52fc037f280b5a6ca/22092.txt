                          PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDEN¥ee~pnversion
                              AT LEAST A $76 BILLION SURPLUS IN 1999
                                                       January 6, 1999

            President Clinton and Vice President Gore Have Put America's Fiscal House In Order and
            Closed The Book On A Generation of Deficits. In 1993, President Clinton and Vice President
            Gore put in place a three-part economic strategy: to cut the deficit to help reduce interest rates and
            spur business investment; to invest in education, health care, and technology so that America was
            prepared to meet the challenges of the 21 st century; and to open markets abroad so that American
            workers would have a fair chance to compete and win across the globe. Today, America's fiscal
            house is in order. The Office of Management and Budget now projects that the budget surplus in
            fiscal year 1999 will exceed $76 billion.

                Instead of $404 Billion Deficit, At Least $76 Billion Surplus This Year. When President
                Clinton took office, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected the deficit to be $404
                billion this year; using preliminary information, the Administration expects the surplus to be at
                least $76 billion this year.

                At Least $76 Billion Surplus -- The Biggest Dollar Surplus in History. In 1992, the deficit
                was $290 billion -- the biggest dollar deficit in American history. This year, the
                Administration expects the surplus to be at least $76 billion -- the biggest dollar surplus in
                American history. As a share of GDP, the budget surplus would be almost one percent this
                year -- the largest since the 1950s. And for the first time in 40 years, we will have a budget
                surplus for two years in a row.

                Seven Years in A Row of Fiscal Improvement -- The First Time in U.S. History.
                Reaching a surplus in 1999 would mark the seventh consecutive year of improved fiscal
                balance -- the longest period of consistent improvement in all of American history.

            ·   While Cutting Federal Spending To Its Lowest in a Quarter Century, President Clinton
                Has Expanded Critical Investments in the Future, Such As Education and Training.
                President Clinton's 1993 Economic Plan included $255 billion in spending cuts over five years
                -- more than half ofthe·total deficit reduction package. As a result, federal spending as a share
                of the economy has declined for each of the past six years and is now the lowest in 24 years.
                However, as spending has been cut in lower priority areas, President Clinton has dramatically
                increased funding in critical areas, such as education and training, children, the environment,
                health care, and research and development.

                While Eliminating The Budget Deficit, President Clinton Has Provided Tax Relief for
                Middle-Income Families. Because of the tax cuts for working families signed into law by
                President Clinton, the typical American family of four will face the lowest federal tax burden in
                over two decades (since 1976). President Clinton proposes to build upon this record to
                provide additional targeted, paid-for tax relief for child care, education, pensions, affordable
                housing, and the environment.

            We Cannot Turn Back: We Have Fixed The Fiscal Deficit, Now We Must Fix The Generational
            Deficit. President Clinton is committed to taking advantage of this historic opportunity to save
            Social Security for the 21 st century. We must act now to tackle this tough, long-term challenge;
            and President Clinton believes that we must do it in a way that maintains universality and
            fairness, ensures that Social Security continues to provide a benefit people can count on,
            protects low-income and disabled beneficiaries, and maintains our fiscal discipline.
