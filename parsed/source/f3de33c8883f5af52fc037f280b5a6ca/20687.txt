    WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SCHOOL SAFETY. President Clinton announced
    today that he will hold a White House Conference on School Safety on October 15. The
    conference will bring together students, parents, educators, police and juvenile justice officials,
    community based organizations and mental health experts to review what is know about the most
    effective ways to prevent school violence, and to respond to serious incidents of violence in our
    schools when they do occur. The conference will lead to the development of a national action
    plan for keeping our schools safe, disciplined (and drug free???), including ways of strengthening
    the federal Safe and Drug Free Schools Program.

    PRESIDENT CLINTON CHALLENGES CONGRESS TO STRENGTHEN PUBLIC
    SCHOOLS. President Clinton called on Congress to support his efforts to improve and reform
    K-12 education by putting standards, accountability, and choice back into our public schools.
    The President said that we must make the strategic investments necessary to ensure that our
    children are prepared for the 21 st century, by reducing class size, modernizing our schools,
    investing in technology, expanding after-school learning opportunities, raising standards and
    ending social promotions. The President criticized Congress for taking steps in the opposite
    direction, by cutting $2 billion from his request for education investments, short-changing
    initiatives on education reform, on raising educational achievement for our children, and on
    providing focused help for students who need it most.

     RAISING TEACHER STANDARDS. With two million teachers to be hired in the next
    ten years to accommodate booming student enrollments and an aging teaching force,
    President Clinton called on Congress to approve his legislative agenda to boost teaching
    quality. He called on Congress to enact his proposals provide financial incentives for
    talented young people and mid-career professionals who commit to teaching at high-need
    schools, and improve the preparation of future teachers. He also called on Congress to
    enact his proposals to help high-need urban and rural school districts undertake serious
    reforms to raise standards -- including rewarding good teachers and identifying
    incompetent or burnt-out teachers, giving them intensive assistance, and finding ways to
    make sure that those who don't improve leave the classroom. Finally, he called on
    Congress to enact his class size and teacher quality proposal, which would help local
    communities hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a national
    average of 18, and would require new teachers hired under the initiative pass competency
    tests before entering the classroom. Praising AFf's appeals for higher standards for
    students and teachers, the President called on every AFf affiliate to become full partners in
    boosting the quality of teachers and of all public schools.
