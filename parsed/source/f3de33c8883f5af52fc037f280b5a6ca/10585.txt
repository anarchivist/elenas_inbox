This is clearly a Maria decision.

I'd like this story produced at some point, did not realize it was really a
possibility to get it done for the budget. From my perspective, it would be
fabulous to try. Would presumably just KILL any claims that POTUS has
dropped
this from the radar screen, etc. Would also give me some useful material
for
the President's book, which will have an "accomplishments" chapter.

She has a 6:30 meeting on rOllout/communications in relation to race
initiative-related matters in the budget and SOTU. So maybe Josh can get
her to
make a decision there. I'm not planning to attend, cuz I'm trying to write.

To be concrete: I would favor the elaborate alternative, and failing that,
just
the enforcement numbers. I don't think the crosscut standing relatively
naked
would be a plus.

By copy of this.I'm suggesting that Julie Fernandes of DPC weigh in, and


    Clara
    Shin of Maria's office.
