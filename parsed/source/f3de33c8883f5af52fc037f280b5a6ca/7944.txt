TEXT:
Right after I got off the phone with you, Caroline Fredrickson called back
and asked if we could use Budget Committees numbers for the Gramm chart
($17 b for the first 5 years and $38 billion for the next five years).

This is how they arrived at those numbers:  Budget Committee scored the
original Gramm at $52 billion over the first five years, and $81 b over
the next five years.  Gramm is saying that he will scale back to 1/3 of
the first five years ($17 b) and half (or slightly under half) for the
second five ($38 b).
