TEXT:
HHS's civil rights person (Dennis Hayashi) just told me that HHS has
prepared guidance for states on civil rights laws and welfare reform, in
consultation with EEOC, Labor, Education, USDA, and DOJ.   (Who knew?)
Anyway, they have a 20 page draft they just sent me that I will forward to
you.  There is a letter with an overview of the laws and a "technical·
assistance for caseworkers" document in the form of Q&A's and examples.  I
don't think the timing is urgent in any way.

It doesn't seem like a terrible idea to remind states and their agents of
laws against discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, disability,
age, etc., just as states are making this major change in their welfare
programs. Most of the examples given are common sense but, of course,
there are some issues. Three or four examples seemed odd to me, but since
I don't know civil rights laws that well, perhaps they are natural
extensions of the law.   By far the most glaring one to me is as follows:

"The Act imposes a 5-year time limit on receipt of TANF benefits.
However, a state may allow hardship exemptions from the time limit for up
to 20% of its caseload.  States and counties may not use a neutral
criterion that has a disproportionate impact on minorities to detemine who
will be granted this exemption, unless it can be shown that this is
necessary, and no less discriminatory alternative is available."

I assume we would like Rob Weiner (or whoever is the appropriate person in
counsel's office) to review this.  Let me know if you want to take a
different approach.
