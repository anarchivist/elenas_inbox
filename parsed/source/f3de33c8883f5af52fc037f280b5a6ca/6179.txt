         Subject:         EEOC Funding Talking Point

         I must once again voice my concern about the continuing insistence that
         the principal talking point regarding fully funding the EEOC is the
         "backlog of 60,000" complaints.    (The President's remarks in the State of
         the Union).   After much discussion among the appropriate parties at the
         White House (DPC) , OMB, and the EEOC, I find it hard to understand why
         this point is still be used.   It is factually incorrect to characterize
         the EEOC's current inventory of pending cases as "backlog." Further, with
         an average .80,000 cases being filed each year with the EEOC, the pending
         inventory (or "backlog") simply cannot be brought down as low as the
         28,000 number that was released to the press in conjunction with Vice
         President Gore's MLK day speech.

         A thorough discussion and explanation of this point is beyond any e-mail.
         I just want to go on record that in my opinion, as well as the opinion of
         both political appointees and career employees at the EEOC (from whom I
         hear on a routine basis), it is very unwise to base any argument in favor
         of more funding for the EEOC on this statement.  ANY basic investigation
         by the press or congressional oversight/appropriations staff will quickly
         show that this representation is not a viable goal for the agency.    In
         short, the focus should be on providing resources to the agency to permit
         faster quality investigations (this means more and better trained intake
         personnel and investigators), not on simply processing and closing cases.
         The later is precisely what Eleanor Holmes Norton's Rapid Charge
         Processing tried to do twenty years ago (when she was EEOC Chair)   and it
         was un~formly rejected by the civil rights community as well as the
         employer/business community.

         I've spent the last eight years studying, working at, and helping to
         re-invent the EEOC.  I strongly believe that it is not in the best
         interest of either the President or the PIR to continue to use this as the
         core element of the public arg.ument in favor of increased civil rights
         funding.
"

    I would be happy to talk or work with anyone interested in improving and
    strengthening the points to use in making this argument.  Thank you.
