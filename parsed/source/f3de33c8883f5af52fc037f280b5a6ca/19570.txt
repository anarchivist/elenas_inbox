TEXT:
As I mentioned an earlier e-mail, the CBC was scheduled to respond to our
position on needle exchange today. As I write, they should be holding a
press conference on the Hill.
As I understand it, there position will be to support Shalaha, blast
McCaffrey and send a strongly worded letter to the President reflecting
their views.

I went back and forth with them on a number of issues ------won a few lost
one or two.
