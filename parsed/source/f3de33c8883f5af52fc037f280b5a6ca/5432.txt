TEXT:
We're planning on getting you the memo tomorrow by noon. On the EEOC
dispute, I talked to Ellen v. at EEOC about the specific agencies
objecting to the proposed new review format.  I asked her to get me the
background material as soon as she could, and said I thought we would want
to go to bat for them with the relevant bodies: She said she'd get me
material by Friday.
