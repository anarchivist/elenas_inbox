TEXT:
Thanks for sharing the alA report. I was facsincated to learn of Gov.
Nelson's support for our testing initiative.  I guess I was fooled by the
story in Education Week last Spring, indicating that, since Nebraska
doesn't have a statewide testing system in place, it was clearly not going
to buy into a national test. Maybe Gov. Nelson missed that article as
well.

My understanding from ED intergovernmental staff is that at some event
last week here in town, while Gov. Nelson did oppose the Gorton amendment
(mainly because the block grants bypass the states), he also made a point
of expressing his belief that ED programs are way too intrusive, that we
don't need all of those separate programs, and that we probably don't need
ED itself.
