Early Warning Guide

Q.    What is in this early warning guide?

A.    In response to the tragic loss of life and injuries at Thurston High School in Springfield,
      Oregon, in his June 13 radio address, President Clinton directed the Secretary of
      Education and the Attorney General to develop a guide to help teachers, principals, and
      parents respond to the early warning signs oftroubled youth that can lead to school
      violence. The guide, based on research and experience in schools around the country,
      gives school conununities information on how to:

      (1) Identify the early warning signs that relate to violence and other behaviors, including a
      list of specific signs to look for in troubled youth, such as: uncontrolled anger; patterns of
      impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating, and bullying; detailed and specific threats to
      use violence; gang affiliations; feelings of persecution; and past history of violent and
      aggressive behaviors such as cruelty to animals or fire setting. Trained staff can use
      these early warning signs, together with knowledge about students and their
      circumstances, to determine when to seek help for individual students and to prevent
      violence.

      (2) Take action steps to prevent violence. intervene and get help for troubled children,
      and respond to school violence when it is imminent or has occurred. The guide instructs
      schools how to develop a violence prevention and response plan and form a school-based
      team to oversee the plan's implementation. It provides a crisis procedure checklist, a
      step-by-step plan to follow once sudden violence occurs. The guide also lists actions
      students can take -- such as listening to troubled friends, involving trusted adults, and
      asking law enforcement to conduct school safety audits -- to help create safer schools


Q.    How are you planning on making the guide available to schools? Can others get it
      as well?

A.    Today, the guide will be posted on the Education Department Website that can be
      downloaded by anyone interested in obtaining a copy. On September I, the Education
      Department will send a copy to every school in the country. In addition, the Education
      and Justice Departments will have extra copies available to handle additional requests.


Q.    The report states that schools are very safe. But how many youths were killed in
      schools last year?

                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
     5 adults were killed in or on school grounds in the 1997-98 school year. In 1996-97,
     there were 24 young people killed in schools in addition to 4 adults. While there are
     over 52 million young people in this country, even one of these deaths is too many.

     Serious violent crime is not something that the vast majority of schools have to contend
     with during the school year. A recent Department of Education survey of school
     principals released earlier this year indicated that 90% of our schools are free of serious
     violent crime -- which we define as a physical attack, fight with a weapon, robbery, rape,
     murder, or suicide. Moreover, according to a recent Justice Department report on
     student victimization between 1989 and 1995, there was no change in the percentage of
     young people reporting any type of victimization for violent or property crimes.


Q.   The report cautions several times that it should not be used to label students. Why
     the concern about this guide being misused?

A.   This guide was designed to help teachers and others identify individual youth who may be
     in need of services. It is a guide that supports discussion and training for all staff. We
     clearly do not want this manual to be used inappropriately, either to misidentify youth, or
     to identify young people for the wrong reasons. Unlike a checklist, this is a guide that
     should prompt teachers and other school staff to get additional help when they become
     concerned about a child.

     We hope that each school system and school will provide teachers and other school staff
     with a straight forward procedure for consulting with qualified professionals. In most
     schools, as the guide states, the parent and principal will be the first to be consulted and
     the principal should be responsible for calling in the expert, such as a school
     psychologist.


Q.       What other actions will the administration be taking to address the issue of school        safety?

A.      White House Conference On School Safety
        In July, the President announced a White House Conference on School Safety, and
        proclaimed October 15, 1998, National School Safety Day. The White House
        Conference will be linked by satellite to communities and schools across the country,
        including those communities impacted by the recent wave of school shootings. This
        conference is an important step in our continuing effort to provide information to
        communities so that we can make all of our schools safe places for learning.

        First Annual Report on School Safety.
        In December, the President called for the development of an Annual Report on

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
         The report will include: an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an
         overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies that are
         successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class disruption; actions that
         parents can take locally to combat school crime, including a local safety checklist; and
         resources available to schools and communities to help create safe, disciplined, and
         drug-free schools.



Police Corps

Q.        What is the Police Corps?

A.        The Police Corps is a police officer recruitment program, authorized in the 1994
          Crime Act, that provides educational assistance to college students in exchange for
          their commitment to serve with a local law enforcement agency for four years after
          graduation.

          Students accepted into the Police Corps receive up to $7,500 per year to cover
          educational expenses (maximum of $30,000 for four years). In addition, students
          receive a $250 per week stipend during the 16-week Police Corps training program.
          If the participant does not satisfY the program requirements, the scholarship must be
          repaid.


Q.        Are there any incentives for police departments to hire Police Corps graduates?

A.        Police and sheriffs' departments that hire Police Corps participants receive $10,000
          per participants for each year of required service.


Q.        How are students selected for Police Corps?

A.        To be eligible for the Police Corps, a student must attend a four-year college or
          university. Undergraduate participants must attend school full-time. Students who
          attend community colleges are eligible to apply, however, they must transfer to a
          four-year college before they are eligible for assistance. Participants are not required
          to major in criminal justice or law enforcement.

          Each participating state selects an agency to administer their Police Corps program.
          That agency determines other selection criteria for choosing student participants.


Q.        Which states participate in the program?
                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex.Dump Conversion
     Corps-- bringing the total number to 23 states. The new states are: Colorado,
     Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Utah, and the Virgin Islands. They join
     Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri,
     Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina,
     Texas, and Washington.
