TEXT:
Yesterday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the industry
plaintiffs (Northwest Forest Resources Council) petition for
rehearing in the decision dealing with how the land management
agencies determine how marbled murrelets are "nesting". We doubt
the plaintiffs will go to the Supreme Court on this; it's probably
the end of the road for them on the legal front.
This leaves the issue of replacement timber of like kind, value
and volume as the remaining big issue related to the
implementation of Section 2001(k) (the old growth sales). USDA
has sent a directive to the Forest Service instructing them to
begin the process of identifying and offering replacement timber
sales that are in compliance with all environmental laws, and to
use the remaining unadvertised FY 1996 Northwest Forest plan
timber as the first source for that.  There are rumblings that the
purchasers won't take forest plan timber because it puts them at
odds with other timber companies who want to bid on that timber.
Industry has approached USDA about opening disucssions on the
replacement timber; there will be a meeting later this week with


representatives of USDA and Justice and industry reps. to explore
a possible settlement (this should stay close hold for now) .
On another but related timber front, various environmental groups
will be noting the year anniversary of the signing of the timber
rider this week with demonstrations, etc., in the Pacific
Northwest.  USDA is getting information Thursday on how many
salvage sales scheduled to be offered under the rider will be
withdrawn as the result of the Secretary's recent directive;
however, they are debating whether to release that information
immeditately or whether to wait for an August 1st Senate Energy
and Resources hearing at which Senator Craig will criticize the
directive.
