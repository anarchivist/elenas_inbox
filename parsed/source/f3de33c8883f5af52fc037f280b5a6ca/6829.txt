TEXT:
The final deal with the conference on agric. research on food stamps is as
follows:

$818m total to go to legal immigrant restorations (vs. our $2·.5b request)

For refugees, asylees, the Hmong, and the disabled, we got essentially
what was in the President's budget.

For the elderly, we will cover those who were 65 or older and in the
country when the law was signed. (The President's budget was somewhat more
generous - - i f you were in the country when the law was signed but not yet
65, you would get benefits when you turned 65.)

For families with children, we will cover children who were here when the
law was signed, but not their parents.  (The President's budget would
cover both children and their parents, and both those here when the law
was signed and those who arrived after.  Congress wouldn't consider this.)

This is expected to be approved by both houses without any problem.

So it's a pretty good deal given the money that was available. The next-
question is whether we will have a chance to do more later this year
through other vehicles.
