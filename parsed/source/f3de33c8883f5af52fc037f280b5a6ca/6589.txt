TEXT:
Erskine should be a little cautious about going to the House on tobacco
farmers.  Most of them are waiting to see if Robb and Ford work out a deal
-- Etheridge has (confidentially) asked to introduce what they come up
with and thinks he can attract the key members.  In the meantime, Baesler
is going with a bill that.is another $15 billion more than the Ford bill.
If it becomes a separate bidding war in the House I think that we may get
expectations raised for farmers that won't be met.
