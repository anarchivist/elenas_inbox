TEXT:
My enthusiasm for and involvement in Saturday's meeting will be limited.
So here is a summary of my thoughts on what we face over the next several
weeks:

EDUCATION:     POTUS eager for higher profile

6/10 -- Education Standards event -- releasing test scores on 4th/8th
grade math and science, compared with other countries.  This is real news,
makes good case that we are 1} making progress and 2} need an 8th grade
math test (because kids do well in 4th and poorly in 8th). We don't get
many opportunities to make real news on standards, so we shouldn't blow it
off for something else.

6/25 -- Family Conference    announce business support and $$ for school
reform efforts in areas that commit to our tests.  (VP is working out
details)

6/30    Boston reading event -- a chance to talk about the budget, ask
Weld if he wants any other jobs in the Admin

7/2 -- Major league baseball PSAs on standards (Camden Yards with Cal
Ripken) -- we are crazy not to do this.   It's the best, easiest mainstream
plug for standards and values we'll ever· come across.

Sometime in July before 7/25 NGA mtg -- a multi-state or mUlti-city sign
up for the testing initiative. An NGA endorsement is unlikely, but not
out of the question.


WELFARE

An immigrant event (mayors and groups) would help rally support against
GOP plans to gut budget agmt. We should do this by mid-July at the
latest, before reconciliation gets to conference.

A speech to state legislature on welfare, challenging them to put people
to work not just cut them off. Almost any state will do.    Calif and NY
might attract the most interest and have the biggest case loads (and most
explosive internal politics). We have other small-bore policy news to
make as well (caseload drop will hit 3 ~illion sometime in next 2 months;
we have a child care quality regulation almost ready to go) .

We just received an invitation to address a group of 10,000 small
businesses on welfare reform in North Carolina July 24-26.
·

    Child support felony legislation:     It's not too late to use this for the
    Father's Day radio address.


    HEALTH CARE

    Children's health study (ready)

    Genetic screening legislation (good women's health event)

    Pediatric drug regulation (someday)


    TOBACCO

    EO on smoking in federal workplace (still haven't seen formal proposal
    from DOJ)

    Settlement talks will rise or fall in next 2-3 weeks. We should
    immediately direct public health advisers to review. This will be a tight
    squeeze -- we'll probably get a good deal the President will want to
    support, and the public health validators will be split over whether it's
    worth it. We should fight to own at least one piece of it -- the big $
    for children's health (similar to Hatch-Kennedy).


    CRIME

    Cops in public housing (San Francisco)

    Brady decision (pre-July 4th)
