Subject:         Scheduling Seat Belt Event

Scheduling put a hold on our seat belt event in part, as I understand from
Jennifer Palmieri, . because of Ann Lewis's concerns about the EO.   I let
Jennifer know -- and you should let Ann know -- that the EO is NOT central
to the event and can be modified or dropped.    The only remaining issue is
NGA's expected opposition to our soft sanctions proposal I noted earlier.

We have to do the event next week if we want it to be newsworthy -- since
the legislation must go to the Hill before McCain's 4/17 hearing and the
legislation is the new policy announcement. Jennifer asked us to send in
another scheduling request.  Christa and I have drafted it and Christa
will discuss with you shortly.  Just want to make sure any decision to
forgo a presidential event is made based on the right information.

Finally, if we use the weekly report to get a decision from POTUS on soft
sanctions will we get an answer back in time for a possible event next
week?
