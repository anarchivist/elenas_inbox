TEXT:
As most of you know, DOL has informed me that Engler insists on starting
to privatize Michigan's Employment Servie Monday. As a result, DOL is
preparing a  lettter to the Michigan Employment Commissioner stating that
DOL will begin to withhold federal funds for the operation of the
Employment Service because the state is breaking the law.

Karen--I understand that Kitty called you about this. Have you seen this
letter? Do you know if they have let WH Leg Affairs and the Press Office
know? Do we know what the impact of withholding funds will do to
recipients?

Diana-- I know you are trying to get your hands on a copy of the letter.
Can you find out if they are doing talking points?
