        The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (''ENDA "). This bill
        would outlaw discrimination in hiring, firing and promotions based
        on sexual orientation. It is designed to protect the rights of all Americans to
        participate in the job market without fear of unfair discrimination.
        The Act provides an exemption for small businesses, the Anned
        Forces, and religious organizations, including schools and other
        educational institutions that are substantially controlled or supported
        by religious organizations. The bill specifically prohibits preferential
        treatment on the basis of sexual orientation, including quotas. President
        Clinton and Vice President Gore are the first President and Vice President
        ever to back civil rights legislation for gays and lesbians. President Clinton
        originally announced his support for the legislation in October, 1995.


        The Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This measure expands the
        principal federal hate crimes statute. The current statute prohibits
        any use of force that is based on a person's race, color, religion, or
        national origin and that is intended to interfere with certain
        specified federally protected activities. The Hate Crimes Prevention Act
        would strengthen and expand the ability of the Justice Department to
        prosecute hate crimes by removing needless jurisdictional requirements
        for existing crimes. Further, it would give Federal prosecutors the power
        to prosecute hate crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation,
        gender or disability. President Clinton originally announced his support for
        the bill on November 10, 1997 at the first-ever White House Conference
        on Hate Crimes.
