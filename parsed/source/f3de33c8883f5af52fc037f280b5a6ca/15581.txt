Subject: SF Domestic Partnership Law - Should Straights Be Excluded

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER, May 16, 1997

Katz eyes partners law for gays only
Asks city attorney for opi'nion on excluding straights; such a change would
face fierce fight
Rachel Gordon
OF THE EXAMINER STAFF
         A plan to alter San Francisco's landmark domestic partners law and
allow some companies to exclude straight couples is quietly resurfacing at
City Hall - despite word a month ago that the proposal was dead.
         Supervisor Leslie Katz has asked the city attorney to look into the
possibility of a gay-only amendment, but isn't sure she'll propose it to
her
colleagues.
         "It's something I'm exploring right now," Katz said.
         The idea is that companies that now provide domestic partners
benefits only to gay and lesbian employees could continue doing so without
expanding the benefits to straight unmarried couples.
         Without that provision, those companies that conduct business with
The City would be violating the domestic partners law.
         Should Katz propose the change, it would have to be approved by the
Board of Supervisors and the mayor - and would include a "sunset" provision
to expire after a specified length of time.
         The City's law, which goes into effect June 1, requires those doing
business with San Francisco to provide the same benefits to workers
registered as domestic partners - gay or straight - as they do to married
employees.
         This week, the Air Transport Association, the lobbying arm of the
nation's major airlines, sued in u.S. District Court to overturn the law.
The
suit charges The City is illegally regulating an industry governed by
federal
law.
         If Katz goes ahead with the amendment, she can expect a fight.
Supervisor Tom Ammiano, a co-sponsor of the ordinance, opposes the


proposal,
saying it would weaken the law.
         The politically powerful Harvey Milk Lesbian / Gay / Bisexual
Democratic Club, which first suggested such a law, called the proposed
change
discriminatory.
         "The queer community should not discriminate against straight
people," club President Jeff Sheehy said.
         The gay-only provision is being pushed by the Committee on Jobs, a
lobbying group for corporate San Francisco, and some other business
interests.
         Committee on Jobs chief lobbyist Don Solem declined to specify what
companies would benefit from the proposed change. He said the decision to
urge a change was made collectively by the committee's members.
         For example, The Gap, a committee member, has a same-sex only
domestic partners policy but has no contracts with The City, said company
spokeswoman Beverly Butler.
         Ammiano said he'd be willing to consider an exemption on a
case-by-case basis if a company made a legitimate appeal.
         Solem said the law is an anti-discrimination ordinance written
because gay people cannot legally marry in the United States.
         The idea of forcing companies to extend benefits to unmarried
straight couples "is a whole different issue."
         "We've always thought that the same-sex issue was the primary
intent
of The City's law," Solem said this week.
         The potential cost also concerns the business community. Studies
have
shown the majority of domestic partners beneficiaries are straight.
         Katz said businesses that already have a same-sex domestic partners
benefits policy should be given some slack.
         "As a city we should reward employers who made efforts on their own
to address discrimination," she said.
         Eventually, Katz said, the exemption for those companies would end
and they would have to extend domestic partners benefits to heterosexual
employees.
         Supervisor Susan Leal said she would support the amendment,
agreeing
companies that "have shown good faith by already offering domestic partners
benefits for gay and lesbian employees" should get a break.
         When a similar proposal surfaced last month, it was quickly dropped
when opposition surfaced. At the time, Katz said, "This wasn't anything any
of us cared passionately about, to be blunt.      . It wasn't something we
were going to go to the mat on."
         The first proposal would have let city contractors limit the
domestic
partners benefits solely to gay employees. The new version would apply just
to companies that already have such a plan in place.
         Leal said she backed off last month because she didn't want a show
of
divisiveness among the board's gay and lesbian members. Ammiano, Leal and
Katz are the board's gay members. Ammiano said he will not change his mind.
         "The law is the law," he said. "Don't even mess with it."
