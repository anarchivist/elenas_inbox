TEXT:
You should have already received (or you will shortly receive) OPM's
report to Congress on the Federal Employee Family Friendly Leave Act.   I
want to draw to your attention two things about   this LRM.  First, the
report discusses in a few places the definition of "family member"
(especially pages 4 and 13), and I want to make sure the discussions are
acceptable to you.  Second, the report mentions in a number of places
Executive Orders that have been issued, and I want to make sure that they
were factually correct.
