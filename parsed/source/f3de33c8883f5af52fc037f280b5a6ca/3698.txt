     TEXT:
     Josh Gotbaum asked that we coordinate with you how the House Rules SAP for
     the L/HHS appropriations bill should read with regard to family planning
     and "Hyde" abortion issues. We need your response by noon today.   Please
     call me (Greg White) at 5-7791 or Richard Turman 5-4926 with questions and
     or your response.

     We understand that the House Rules Committee met last night and adopted a
     rule that makes the amendments below in order.    We wanted to check with
     you to see if you would like to modify the current draft SAP text given
     the House Rules Committee action regarding the Amendments below. The FY
     1998 Labor/HHS/Ed Appropriations bill is scheduled for debate on the House
     Floor TOMORROW.

     Amendments In Order for House Floor L/HHS Debate

     A Hyde amendment that expands the existing Hyde limitation on abortion
     funding to prohibit HMO financing of abortion.  The language appears to
     also prohibit State or private financing of abortions by HMOs
     participating in the Medicaid program.

     A Lowey substitute that clarifies the existing Hyde limitation on abortion
     financing by prohibiting the use of federal funds by HMOs for abortion
     services.

     An Istook amendment that requires written consent or proof of actual
     notice from a parent or guardian (five days in advance) before a minor
     could receive contraceptive drugs or devices at a Title X clinic.
     Provides for the alternative of court consent if parent's consent cannot
     be obtained. Limitations do not apply to family planning counseling.
     Requires that staff at Title X clinics comply with State and local


 reporting requirements on evidence of child abuse, molestation, sexual
 abuse, rape, or incest.

 A Porter substitute that essentially restates current law while clarifying
 that Title X grantees encourage family involvement and counsel minors on
 how to resist coercive sexual activity.

 The draft SAP that was sent around yesterday had the text below for Family
 Planning and Hyde issues.  Please let us know how/if you would like to
 modify the draft language below. (We will obviously update the letter to
 reflect that House Rules has now made these amendments in order.)

 HYDE LANGUAGE IN CURRENT DRAFT SAP
 "We understand that an amendment may be made in order that would expand
 the current
 D&Hyde AmendmentD8 prohibition on Medicaid payment for abortion services
 to include a prohibition
 on the purchase of health benefit coverage that includes abortion. The
 President believes that
 abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. We believe that the amendment
 could curtail the
 availability of State-only and privately funded abortion services. Most
 States purchase health
 coverage for Medicaid beneficiaries from managed care organizations
 (MCOs). Under this
 amendment, States may be prohibited from contracting with MCOs that offer
 abortion services
 to any woman, even using private or State funds.  This provision could
 limit StatesD, ability
 to negotiate contracts with providers, limiting access to quality care for
 Medicaid beneficiaries.
 This prohibition could also limit StatesD, flexibility to purchase
 abortion services with their own
 funds and may even have the effect of causing MCOs to drop all coverage of
 abortion services
 for women with private health insurance so the MCO may continue to
 participate in the Medicaid
 program. The Administration opposes this attempt to constrain further the
 availability of abortion
 services and strongly urges House not to adopt this amendment."

 FAMILY PLANNING LANGUAGE IN CURRENT DRAFT SAP
 "The Administration supports efforts to encourage minors to discuss their
 health care needs with
 their families.  However, it would oppose a potential amendment on the
 House floor requiring
 parental consent for minors to receive reproductive health services in
 Title X Family
 Planning clinics. Mandating parental consent could discourage sexually
 active minors from
 seeking health care and reproductive counseling services and thus lead to
 more unwarranted
 pregnancies, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases,
 including HIV,
 among our nationD,s youth. As an alternative, the Administration supports
 the amendment
 adopted in Committee that requires clinics to certify that they encourage
 family participation
 in the decision of minors to seek family planning services and provide
 counseling to minors


 on resisting attempts to coerce minors into engaging in sexual
 activities."
