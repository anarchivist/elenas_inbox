National Week of Service
Today the President is designating a new national week of service (April l3-19). The President
is asking AmeriCorps alumni and returned Peace Corps volunteers to engage young people in
service across the country. AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps will organize activities in more
than 15 states and in hundreds of communities, with 3,000 to 4,000 youth newly engaged in
service during the week. These efforts will build on the existing National Volunteer Week and
National Youth Service Day (April 15), which are a public-private partnership between the
Corporation for National Service, the entire national service network, and community volunteers,
including the Points of Light Foundation, Youth Service America, the US Chamber of
Commerce, the US Conference of Mayors, Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, and many
others. During the week, as many as 2 million young people will participate in 3,000 events
across the country.

Maryland and High School Service
The Maryland high school and middle school students at the White House today (see attached
list) are actively engaged in service. Their community service and service learning activities
include tutoring, mentoring, assisting in food and clothing drives, and many other activities.
Maryland is the only state in the nation with a state-wide service learning graduation
requirement, but many school districts and private schools throughout the nation include service
learning as an element of effective education. Maryland Lt. Governor Kathleen Kennedy
Townsend spearheaded the idea in Maryland and founded the organization that oversees this
requirement throughout the state.

The National Service Scholars Program
Today the President announced the launching of his National Service Scholars program -- an
opportunity for schools and communities to recognize young people for outstanding volunteer
service while helping them continue their education with a $1,000 scholarship. The Corporation
for National Service is offering a matching $500 scholarship for one high school junior or senior
selected by each principal. Already a host of civic volunteer organizations -- including the
Veterans of Foreign Wars, Moose International, Lions Clubs, and the U.S. Jaycees among others
-- have accepted the President's challenge to work with their local chapters to provide matching
funds for these scholarships. These organizations will work with high schools to identify one
student in each high school doing outstanding community service. Applications went out to
high school principals two weeks ago. For 1997, at least $3 million in matching funds is
available, and the President's budget includes funds to make this program nation-wide next year.

Benefits of Service Learning Programs
A new study by Brandeis University and Abt Associates for the Corporation for National Service
shows that well-designed, fully-implemented service learning programs improve learning,
strengthen civic attitudes, and promote service activities. Students who participate in these
school programs actually get better grades in math, science, and social studies. They also
become better citizens -- more aware of the needs in their community and more personally and
socially responsible. This report is the first national study to show significant gains in academic
                                                                           He)(-Dump Coove:sion

achievement by high school and middle school students as a result of service learning programs.
The study evaluated 1,000 students in programs in 17 sites across the country during the 1995-96
school year. Service-learning combines meaningful service activities with formal educational
curriculum and structured time for students to reflect on their service experiences.

Commitment to Summit by Education Associations
Today the President is announcing that the National Association of Secondary School Principals,
representing more than 40,000 school administrators, has responded to the Summit's call to
action by pledging to introduce service learning to more than 2 million students, bringing the
service ethic and opportunity to young people through the National Association of Student
Councils, the National Honor SocietylNational Junior Honor Society; and the new American
Technology Honor Society. In addition, the Council of Chief State School Officers has already
made a commitment to the Summit that they will increase the number of states that use and
support service learning to 25 states by the year 2000.

Presidents' Summit for America's Future
The Summit, which will be held in Philadelphia on April 27-29, was first announced at the White
House this January. The President and former President Bush are honorary co-chairs of the
Summit, with Gen. Colin Powell the General Chairman and Henry Cisneros and Lynda Robb the
vice-chairs. The Summit is an opportunity for all Americans to answer a call to action through
citizen service. The goal is to provide all children and youth with the five fundamental
resources they need: an ongoing relationship with a caring adult, safe places and structured
activities, a healthy start, a marketable skill through effective education, and an opportunity for
young people to give back through community service. Delegations from 140 communities and
50 states will develop plans to help make this a reality.
