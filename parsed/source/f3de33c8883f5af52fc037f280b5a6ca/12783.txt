TEXT:
Here are some highlights from the meeting convened by Julian Epstein to
discuss House strategy on gun legislation:

Attendees: Around 30 or so, including DOJ Leg Affairs, gun control groups,
staff representing Judiciary Cmte. Dems and other Dems very involved in
gun issues (e.g. DeGette and Millender McDonald), and Gephardt's staff.

Discussion: First, Thursday's hearing before McCollum's Crime Subcmte.
Rep. Scott's staff reported that there will be a relatively equal number
of Repub. and Dem. invited witness    (4-3 or 4-4 ratio).  Eric Holder and
Jim Johnson will represent the Administration.    Other witnesses:
         Dem invitees--(l) victim witness--e.g. the father out of Littleton
 (Mauser); (2) a State A.G. or police chief who could put in context the
issue of State prosecutions as well as level of cooperation b/w State and
Fed. law enforcement; (3) a witness who could discuss medical impact of
gun violence; (4) a witness who could discuss parental liability.    There
was some concern about the wisdom a witness in the fourth category, but
Rep. Scott feels very strongly about the need for such a viewpoint.
         Repub. invitees-- (1) Wayne LaPierrre (NRA); (2) a representative
of the gun industry (seems a bit odd to team up with NRA); (3) a witness
who would argue the point about weak Fed. prosecutions of existing laws;
(4) a victim witness (to counter the Dem. victim witness) to make point
that we need to get tougher on "predator" juveniles.    Folks at the meeting
were convinced that the Republicans can't win the victim witness message
duel anyway.
         Member panel--Several Democratic Members have asked to testify
(McCarthy, Blagojovich, and a few others, perhaps even Conyers).    McCollum
is resisting a Member panel, but will get heavy pressure by the Dems to
succumb.

        Floor and Cmte. "guerrilla tactics"--Conyers sent a letter to the
Speaker on Friday asking that the Senate bill be held at the desk and then
taken up before the end of the week as a vehicle to have the House
deliberate gun legislation before the end of the week. There has been no
response yet. Through a series of procedural steps in the committee
during Wed. markup on other legislation and on the Floor as the House


considers an appropriations bill, a bill regarding Missing and Exploited
children and the Memorial Day Recess resolution, Dems will try to heighten
the pressure on Hastert and Hyde this week. No one is under any delusion
that the House leadership will feel enough heat for now to abruptly
schedule gun legislation this week. Hastert will simply run out the
clock.

        Meeting attendees agreed that Members of the House will need to
feel significant editorial , grass roots and other opinion and political
pressure during the break to ensure that the leadership does not change
course on it's commitment to move legislation in June.
