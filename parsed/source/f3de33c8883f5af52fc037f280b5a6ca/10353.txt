TEXT:
1. Tobacco quota. A reminder that we should decide if there is anything
else to advise USDA about the quota issue that will arise early next
week.  (I think they are on the only course they can take.)

2.  Food Safety Meeting. The food meeting is 12/16, and though it is
closed to the press, you might want to do another meeting beforehand with
Neal Lane to make sure we are on the same page re:budget etc.  (we have
been talking with Cliff G.)

Other.
3. Milwaukee.   I mentioned to Bruce an incident on-going in Milwaukee
that was on p.32 of the Milwaukee paper. Someone has threatened to
infect a meat packing plant with the AIDS virus. USDA has put a hold on
the plant's output (which is now many millions of pounds) while the FBI
investigates. Hopefully, it will be cleared up soon.   Glickman is
treating it seriously and is in close contact with law enforcement. I will
keep you informed if there is another development.
