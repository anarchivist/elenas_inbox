TEXT:
just wanted to report that it went very well.    the vp layed out as
clearly as can be that it is time for the secy to take over
management of the forest service -- on a daily basis -- to be
excrutiatingly engaged until this is on a better track.
i think dan appreciates the depth of the problems with the forest
service better than he did.    i think he still does not relish the
idea and that we will have to continue to monitor closely,
however. but, he could not have helped to have gotten the vp's
message.   (by the way, he still had not heard anything about the
infamous 1.6 ,billion letter .... )
it also helped that leon came in for other reasons towards the end
of the meeting and, while leaving, caught dan's eye and said:
"you've got to get on top of this, my friend".
i have just shipped to most of you the long awaited alternative
timber strategy memo that greg frazier handed me after the mtg.     i suspect that we w
and get comments back to greg frazier.    thx.
