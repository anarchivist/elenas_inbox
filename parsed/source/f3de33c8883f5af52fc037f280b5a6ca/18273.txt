TEXT:
You asked about the status of the proposed EEOC regulations that limit
federal agencies ability to veto AJ decisions.  Sally Katzen's office is
the one handling it. They have set up a process for hearing the numerous
complaints they are hearing from agencies. After they have recieved all
the concerns (due by 1/12/98) they will set up a meeting with DPC, OMB,
EEOC to go through the comments, and see what accomadations EEOC can make
so everybody is happier but the deal still gets done. If there are still pr
oblems, Sally would hold meetings with more senior members of the
agencies. We are working with OMB in all this, going to a briefing
tomorrow led by EEOC, and Mary is drafting a background memo for you on
the issues. They know we are shooting for the SOTU.
