EK:

We're talking about the Hill folks on the call now, but here's my list:

Candidates for S. 191 gun bill: Dewine and. Abraham if he's not available.
They were both original cosponsors of the bill. Also, Larry needs to
finesse things w/Specter -- who we don't necessarily want speaking several
days in a row -- but who was the key Senate sponsor of the Degan bill.

Candidates for S. 1525: Bart Stupak from the House introduced the first
Degan House bill and has already expressed interest. He's also a former
MI trooper.

Based on this morning's call, I think we're on track to get this done.
Larry was going to touch base w/Specter; Caroline was going to call Dewine
and Abraham, and check-in w/Biden as a back-up.

Jose'
