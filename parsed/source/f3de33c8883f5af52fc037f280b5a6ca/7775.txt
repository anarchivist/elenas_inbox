TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:
The House Judiciary Committee today voted out the Smith bill, including
the H-1B reforms that we like. No amendments were offered to weaken the
reforms. We sent a letter endorsing the bill and strongly opposing a
weakening of the reforms. Peter secured a "Dear Collegue" letter from
Gephardt, Bonior and others saying the same.

Lofgren and Pease will offer   a training amendment on the floor.  This was
determined by them to be the   fastest way to get the amendment and keep the
bill moving (bypassing other   committees that might have jurisdiction over
the training and application   fee components) .

The final vote was 23 to 4 (with Bryant, Rogan, Cannon and Rothman voting
against) .

We do not yet know when the bill will hit the House floor.

Julie
