TEXT:
Paul, by my calculations based on the business info you sent me, about 5
trillion cigarettes are sold worldwide outside the U.S. -- and only around
150 billion or so are from U.s. cigarette makers. (Phillip Morris 65
billion, RJR 41 billion; I couldn't find figures for US Tobacco and
Loews). Are we really only 3% of the non-U.S. world market for
cigarettes?
