     TEXT:
     I've been thinking about some suggested changes to the weekly strategy
     meetings (including HUD's plea to be included, which we discussed briefly
     on Tuesday). Here are my thoughts:

     Agenda: If you still think an internal agenda prepared in advance
     is useful, I'll
                     try to be more diligent about getting it to you Monday
     afternoon.

     Location:       I think whatever we do it will be hard to pare back
     enough to fit in Bruce's
                     office anymore, which is a real shame.  I guess we can't
     keep stealing all of
                     NEC's chairs even though they steal Bruce's sodas! Bruce
     and Elena, will you
                     still come if we're in 211?

     Rules:          Cathy argues and I agree that the general rule for
     non-White House attendees
                     should be no substitutions -- i.e., if Geri Pallast can't
     make it, she can't send a
                     member of her staff. Otherwise, everyone's calling in
     changes at the last minute.             Phone-ins are acceptable.

     Invitees:       DOL: They've asked to add someone (Leslie Lobel) but haven't
     really justified
                     why they need four people.  I'm disinclined, but could
     investigate further.

                     VP: We may want engage Elaine Kamarck's replacement and encourage h
                     to attend, since the National Performance Review is
     heading up two of our key
                     initiatives -- federal hiring and the VP's "Coalition to
     Sustain Success." (Don Gips             is invited but never comes.)
     I work with NPR independently, but engaging them
                     in this meeting may help keep us informed and keep them on
     message.

                       Other Agencies: HUD and DOT have explicitly asked to be included in


                Tuesday meetings, and SBA has expressed an interest in
being kept more in
                the loop. We could do this several ways:
                        Option #1: Add to the Tuesday meeting one person each from
                        DOT, USDA, SSA, and SBA (I don't think we could
invite HUD and DOT
                        without adding the others) .
                                Advantages: will help us coordinate
Administration wide
                                Disadvantages: new agencies will raise
non-priority issues
                        Option #2:  Diana and I could run a weekly conference call (
                                Wednesday morning) with these agencies and
HHS/DOL to
                                share information.
                                Advantages: will help us coordinate
Administration wide
                                Disadvantages: Somewhat duplicative for
HHS/DOL
                        Option #3: Status quo, but Diana and I make more of an effor
                        base with these agencies independently.

                       I prefer Option #2.   What do you think?
