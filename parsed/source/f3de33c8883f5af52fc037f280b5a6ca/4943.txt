TEXT:
DPC Colleagues:

At INS's request (Julie Anbender), Rahm's suggested a meeting to talk
about the CJS provision to not fund INS' political slots if we don't fund
spend x amount for prisons . . This is new to me, and I'm not sure what
we'll get accomplished on this -- or if there are other matters to be
discussed at the meeting.   Has Rahm mentioned this to you EK or BNR?

Leanee, can you check w/OMB on our statements on this provision, or
anything they might know about this.

Jose'
