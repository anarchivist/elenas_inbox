TEXT:
Bruce and Elena --

Mike and I discussed a set of possible announcements and challenges that
the President could make at Monday's TIMSS event. Mike asked me to run
them by you. Could you please take a particularly close look at # 2, the
challe~ges?


The President could:

1) Highlight the importance of moving forward on his education agenda,
focusing heavily on the voluntary national 8th grade test but also
mentioning class size, modern schools/school construction, urban education
zones, High Hopes, teacher recruitment and training initiatives, and the
$60 million middle school math initiative in the '99 budget.

2) Issue a set of challenges for the nation to help address the issue.
calling on:
         a. states to require new math and science teachers to pass
                         assessments of their knowledge of math or science,   and their
to teach         their subject well, before getting their teaching
license. (33 states are members of an    organization working to
develop and put in place assessments like these over the next
         three years.)

        b.states and school districts to insist that their math and science
                teachers have either majored or minored in their subject
area in college. (The   average K-8 math teacher only takes 3
undergraduate math courses.  28% of math        teachers have neither
neither a major nor minor in math, 55% of physics teachers have
        neither a major nor minor in physics, and 18% of science teachers
have neither a major    nor minor in science.)

         c. students to work hard and take tough courses in math and science
                 in middle school and high school, and for those with real proficienc
math and         science to consider making careers in teaching.  (To help
students do this, also           challenge schools to offer tough
          ·
.......

          math and science classes for all students throughout     middle and
          high school.)

                  d. businesses to make clear that students' performance in school counts
                  and look at students transcripts when considering them for jobs. The
                          President could thank the Business Roundtable and National
          Alliance of Business for        their work on this issue, and announce
          that he would convene a meeting of business     leaders at the White
          House to stimulate action on this nationwide.

                  e. universities to strengthen their programs preparing math and science
                  teachers and to encourage more math and science majors to consider
          careers in      teaching.

                   f. parents to insist on finding out how their child is doing compared to
                           national standards and compared to their peers around the nation and
          world.   (This   leads into national tests, of course.)

          The one other challenge to the states we might want to include is for
          states to adopt rigorous standards in math and science.

          3) Announce new on-line help for parents, teachers, and students in math
          and science:

                  a. TIMSS on-line challenge. Parents will be able -- beginning at
          back-to-school time     this fall -- to download a math and science
          quiz from the internet, give it to their children,      and get a rough
          sense of what their children need to know in math and science and how
                  they are doing compared to their peers around the world.

                  b. New math and science web-site. On Monday, a new website will be
          available       connecting teachers, parents, and students to good
          materials for curriculum and            out-of-school math and
          science learning, drawing on the scientific resources of NASA, the
          Department of Energy, the National Science Foundations, and other federal
                          agencies involved in math and science.   (Thus has been a
          collaborative effort among      more than 40 agencies.  It will be
          ready Monday, but we could also save this for a VP      event later
          this month that could focus more squarely on this website and give more
                  credit to all of the agencies involved.)
