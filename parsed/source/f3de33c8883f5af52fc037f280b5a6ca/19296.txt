    TEXT:
    In an effort to energize minority and religous communities on tobacco, we
    suggest getting Dr. Saatcher to author an op/ed.  One targetted directly
    to minorities re the special advertising, killing minority youth and how
    minority communities have to press for comprehensive tobacco--on the faith
    side it needs to focus on kids dying, targetting of low-income, need for
    legislation and maybe make reference to resources for childcare {maybe}.
    How do we get this done? We are working with specialty press to get this
    placed--and we also need anything HHS could provide on data that would be
    relevant to minorities or the faith community.
