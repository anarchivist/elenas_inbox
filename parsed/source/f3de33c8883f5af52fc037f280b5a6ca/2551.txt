This is my draft for the weekly (part of HEA).      Should I add DPC, and/or

do you

have any other suggestions?



Old Professors: The House bill includes a provision that would allow

colleges

to offer financial incentives for tenured professors to retire early, to

make

room for younger (and generally lower-paid) professors.      The EEOC --'and

the

AARP -- have opposed this provision as permitting O!&age-based, arbitrary

distinctions in employee benefit plans which would disadvantage older

workersO! 8

because it would allow the colleges to deny the incentive to older

professors.

The colleges argue that the tenure system is unique, and that this will

allow

them to diversify the faculty.      My staff is working with Education and the

EEOC

to determine whether there is any reason to reconsider the AdministrationO!,

s

position on this issue.
