TEXT:
Our talking points say in a few spots that Shaw's proposal "violates" the
budget agreement.  This was the language OMB was using, particularly on
immigrants, until Jack Lew softened it in the Shaw letter at the last
minute today.  Therefore, I got a call from Keith Fontenot saying that OMB
thinks we should drop the word "violates" from our talking points and
substitute things like "inconsistent with budget' agreement", etc.  I
think this came from Jack Lew's assistant.

There is a good argument that talking points are different than a
letter .... but do you want me to re-do and go through the pain of sending
out a corrected version with everyone?
