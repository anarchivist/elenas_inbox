TEXT:
There are other data in the MMWR that show that disease incidence for some
diseases is actually up.  My thought is to have the President allude to
that in his remarks, i.e. we still have a long way to go, still have
disease, but not explain in detail.  The disease is mostly among adults,
especially those who enter the country as adults.

Do you both agree with this approach?

Also, Elena, we are not announcing child care conference, right?
