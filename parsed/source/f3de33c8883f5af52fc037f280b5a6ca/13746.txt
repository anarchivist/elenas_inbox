 TEXT:
 just have to say that i believe usda's presentation was absolutely
 unacceptable. they obviously have no idea of what their agency is
 doing. they have no idea of the likely impact of what 'they are
 proposing here.  substantively and politically they are leading us
 in a completely unknown and uninformed direction.
 unless a miracle happens over nite, and they miraculously get on
 top of their program, i have to say that i would be very reluctant
 to act on their proposal.   this of course leaves us vulneralbe on
 thursday and increasingly vulnerable in key states for continued
 and prolonged periods of time.   but, maybe better the devil we
 know than the devil we don't.
 i don't want to write off the possibility that we will get
 something acceptable here to say on thursday. but if we do, it
 will mean that we all will spend untold hours trying to put this
 into shape.
 that to me is dangerous and unacceptable--no matter how hard we
 try we can not understand the program as we should in order
 responsibly to be making these calls. and, in any event, even if
 we do put out a nice statement of policy, there is no other way to
 ensure that it is carried out than for secy glickman to take the
 reigns and make it happen.}
 to me, the bottom line is that the leadership of the agency MUST
 get this program under control.   it is being ignored to the
 president's significant detriment; our entreaties have fallen on


         deaf ears.
         (fyi:  they basically now are turning a blind eye to all of the
         personnel issues too.  jack ward thomas is now staying put and jim
         lyons is still in full gear -- he was with them in yesterday's
         meeting as their spokesman on the issues.)
