Subject:         Note on Child Care from Slate

See bold area -- a network might do a nice package on the
congressional day care center.

Continuing the time-honored tradition of drip-dripping the key
elements of the upcoming State of the Union speech ahead of time,
all of the front pages cover President Clinton's proposal of a
nearly $22 billion package of grants and tax breaks to help working
families pay for child care. The plan would also include tax credits
for businesses that build or expand employee child care facilities.
Congressional rumblings are noted--both USAT and the NYT report that
House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer referred to the plan as
another of Clinton's "small ideas" that "taken together, return to
the era of big government"--but there is no mention of the federally
subsidized state-of-the-art workplace child-care center used by
members of Congress.
