RBlacks and Hispanics more confident in home-buying power

    WASHINGTON (AP)    Blacks and Hispanics are increasingly
optimistic that racial discrimination is becoming less of a barrier
to their buying homes, according to a study released Tuesday by the
Fannie Mae Foundation.
    Nearly half of blacks surveyed, 48 percent, and 36 percent of
Hispanics said being a minority group member presented special
obstacles when it comes to buying a home.
    But the perception that minorities suffer from discrimination
--all or most of the time"   has fallen by one-third among both
blacks and Hispanics.
    The survey of minority home-buying attitudes also found the
percentage of blacks who said they a"re - - at least somewhat
confident" their income and credit record would qualify them for a
mortgage has soared from 49 percent two years ago to 74 percent
today.
    Jim Johnson, Fannie Mae Foundation chairman, said the purpose of
the survey was to gain --insights into how African-Americans and
Hispanics think about home ownership. ' ,                     "
    --We wanted to share this information with all who care about


how to help minorities but homes    mortgage lenders, real estate
professionals, nonprofits and policy-makers,' he said.
     Last year, the home ownership rate for all Americans reached an
all-time high of 65.7 percent. But great disparities exist between
the rate of home owning between whites, blacks and Hispanics.
     Nearly 72 percent of whites own their own homes. Just 45 percent
of blacks and Hispanics own their own homes, according to the study
conducted by the polling firm of Hart-Riehle-Hartwig Research.
     A total of 752 blacks and 751 Hispanics were questioned in the
survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus about 3.5
percent.
     The Fannie Mae Foundation, which works to provide affordable
housing in underserved communities, is funded solely by Fannie Mae,
the" federally chartered mortgage company.
