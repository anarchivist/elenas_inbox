TEXT:

        Sally's query about NRC attending an interagency meeting between EPA
and Energy (hosted by Sally) may be moot.  Evidently, the issues are being worked
out at a staff level, making a policy meeting unnecessary.   I'll let you both
know if it's back on, as Sally may want to discuss further the issue of NRC's
attendance (Kathy, I let Sally know of your initial skepticism).
