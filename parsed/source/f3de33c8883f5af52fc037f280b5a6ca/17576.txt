I know you don't like to hand out the weekly, so I want to check with you
to see if I can pass it along to Christa or not.

Can you send me a copy of the weekly reports when they are turned in? A
lot of time it provides info. on what policies we are working on and for
what events, and I think it would help me know what is on the radar
screen.  Otherwise I get the info. from the staff meetings, but I don't
know that each idea is being discussed there.  Please ask Elena and if she
thinks the staff meetings are sufficient, that is fine.  I think it makes
sense, though. Thanks.
