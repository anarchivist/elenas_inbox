TEXT:
Marcia Hale and Emily say NGA would like us to invite all 6 governors who
are on the NGA 0-3 Committee and let two of them speak. Marcia and Emily
would let Ray at NGA pick the 1 Dem and 1 GOP governor among the 6 to
'participate' (speak in some capacity). They would like to be able to
give NGA an answer before we announce the conference date if possible.

Options:

1. we put off making a decision on their speaking roles until we have
figured out the congressional roles, but say we want an NGA pre sense and
at a staff level ask them whether they think governors would want to come
and stay all day if they did not have speaking roles.  (6 spaces are a lot
to use, esp. if they might only stay for a bit and we do not know the
congressional roles).

2. we say yes to 2 of their picking will have speaking roles of some kind
TBD, and ask whether the others would come if they were not speaking.

3.   we say yes to 2 speak and 6 being invited.

I recommend
