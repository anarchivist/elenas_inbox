TEXT:
OMB staff called me last night to check our position on two D.C. related
tobacco amendments.  Eleanor Holmes Norton had asked the Administration to
support the first and oppose the second, which comports with positions
we've taken.

1) The amendment to allow D.C. to hire a law firm on a contingency basis
(which we already had told OMB we support)

2) The amendment to impose community service and fines on underage teens
who smoke (which I reminded them we had already opposed in a SAP on the
grounds of D.C. micromanagement, saying that while we support the
objectives we should not legislate for D.C. and not all states.)
