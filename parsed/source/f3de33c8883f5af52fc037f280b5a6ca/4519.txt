TEXT:
I thought the meeting was fine, too.

Follow up:

Farmers: Lugar is pushing an $8 a pound buy-out. This would obviously
add substantially to the settlement. We should perhaps be sitting down
with this group of farm legislators to keep track of where it is going.
Lugar is evidently talking to USDA alot.

International: Do we need a working group to put together some further
options?

Meeting with POTUS: Do we want someone to call to Lott/ Daschle or
Gingrich before the meeting to coordinate. its statement afterwards?
