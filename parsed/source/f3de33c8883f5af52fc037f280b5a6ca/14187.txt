TEXT:
Just wanted to let you know that we talked to the Commission staff
regarding the reauthorization bill. They are uncertain about how
events will unfold in the next few days.
As you know, the commission does not have a formal position on
H.R. 3874. Both the Chairman and staff director, however, believe
that it would be preferable for the Commission to continue without
program reauthorization rather than to accept the onerous subpoena
and staff director removal provisions in the bill. As previously
noted by Susan Carr, the Commission can continue to exist with FY
1997 enacted appropriations.
