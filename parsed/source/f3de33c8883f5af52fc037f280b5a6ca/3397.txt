TEXT:
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuter) - Federal Trade Commission Chairman Robert
Pitofsky said on Friday that the agreement
between the tobacco industry and state attorneys general, as it is
written, may permit price-fixing by cigarette companies.

Pitofsky told a small group of reporters that the tobacco agreement
includes an anti-trust exemption. "The exemption is written
in such a way that I believe -- maybe they didn't intend it this way -- it
could cover price-fixing, " Pitofsky said.
