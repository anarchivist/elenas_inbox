                    As you know, the Supreme Court last week granted certiorari in the two assisted suicide
            cases. In March, the Ninth Circuit struck down a Washington state law that prohibited assisted
            suicide. The majority, acknowledging that the state had some legitimate, countervailing
            interests that were reflected in its assisted suicide law, concluded that, on balance, the law
            impermissibly interfered with the constitutionally protected liberty interest of individuals to the
            extent that it prohibited physicians from prescribing life-ending medication for use by terminally
            ill, competent adults who wish to hasten their own deaths.

                    In April, the Second Circuit struck down a series of New York laws that prohibited
            assisted suicide. The majority said that New York did not treat similarly situated persons alike
            in that persons in final stages of terminal illness who are on life-support systems are allowed to
            hasten death by directing the removal of such systems while those who are in final stages of
            terminal illness but who are not on life-support systems are not allowed to hasten death by
            self-administering prescribed drugs.

                    Briefs from New York and Washington states, which seek to overturn the decisions, are
            due November 12. The Justice Department is planning to file an amicus brief in support of the
            two states. Though still being developed, we understand that Justi.ce currently plans to argue
            that the Constitution does not constrain the power of states to pass such laws but will not
            necessarily take a position on the merits of assisted suicide. We will update you as we leam
            more about Justice's plans. However, since the brief is not due until November 12, you may
            want to decide now that there should be some earlier opportunity for announcing the
            government's intention to file such a brief or, in fact, actually filing the brief early.

                   Do you? Announce early or file early?
