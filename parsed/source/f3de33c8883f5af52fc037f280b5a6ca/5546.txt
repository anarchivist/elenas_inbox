TEXT:
I would cut the $1.7 million for the ed survey, lowering our total to $105
million in the memo. Also, I would cut the word "program" in the second
sentence in section IB, it is clumsy sounding.

 Mary is sending a grocery list to you guys of the specifics-- we
solicited a bunch of projects to fill out the ADR, data collection,
technology categories across the different agencies.  If you want to cut
the figure down, t~ere may be other ed surveys in that $21 million or so.

Final thought: we don't mention the commission on civil rights. OMB gave
them a little more money but got some management concessions out of them.
I think they don't fit with this plan and are better off not mentioned.
But you should know in case it comes up.
