TEXT:
As you ponder how to respond to the Lott/Hatch/Abraham letter to the
President, I thought you should be aware of the following (some of which
you probably already know) :

Sen. Abraham's bill (S. 260) reduces the threshold for the 5 year
mandatory for powder cocaine from 500 grams to 100 grams.  The ten year
mandatory threshold for powder is reduced from 5 kilograms to 1 kilogram.
The bill has 14 co-sponsors, including Senators Feinstein and Robb. Mary
Harkenrader from DoJ told me that Torricelli also sign-on, but I could not
confirm this fact.
The DoJ is updating its prison impact assessment of this bill. The most
recent assessment is that this bill would increase prison costs by $200
million in the first year, and impose cumulative costs of $1.5 billion in
the first ten years. Whether the cost will have any political impact in
light of our present budgetary environment, of course, is doubtful at best.
Senator Lott's chief counsel Steve Seale told us that the Republicans
intend to move the Abraham bill, and suggested that they may want to link
the ONDCP reauthorization bill to the bill.
Director McCaffrey believes that the letter to the President means that
there is absolutely no hope of moving the Administration's crack cocaine
initiative. Instead, while we should not retreat from that initiative,
the Administration's energies should be focused on defeating the Abraham
proposal instead of pushing the Administration'S proposal. He has asked
me to come up with a strategy to do so.

Any thoughts? Once you have had a chance to think about this, I propose
that we get together the key players from DoJ, ONDCP and the WH.
