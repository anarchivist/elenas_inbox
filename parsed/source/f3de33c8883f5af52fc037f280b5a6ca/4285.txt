PENALTIES: Change graph to read:

         One approach would be to measure the number of teenagers who smoke a particular
company's brands, and assess a company-by-company surcharge of$I,OOO (about 2 Y2 times
foregone profits) per teen smoker in excess of the youth reduction targets. A second approach
would combine the company-by-company surcharge with a system of graduated penalties that get
stiffer the more the industry misses the targets. For example, the industry could be required to
pay $200 million for each point missed between 0 and 30 percent, $400 million for each point
missed between 30 and 50 percent, and $600 million for each point missed between 50 and 60
percent. Under this approach, the penalties could reach as high as $1 a pack by year 10 if youth
smoking failed to decline.



FUNDING:

       The 1st graph ("Although the settlement...") is fine.

Options for How Much the Industry Should Pay

        2nd graph: The attached charts outline options on how much funding to seek and how to
spend it. The first chart (Table I) suggests four options for how much the industry should pay:

        1. Current settlement: This option assumes repeal of the $50 billion tax credit in the
budget agreement, restoring gross industry payments to the original level negotiated by the
attorneys general -- $368 billion over 25 years, with lookback penalties of $ _ - _ billion over
that period. This option would raise cigarette prices by approximately 60 cents a pack (on top of
the 15-cent increase in the budget agreement).

       2. Tough penalties: This option assumes the full level of base payments in Option 1
($368 billion), with dramatically tougher penalties on the industry if it fails to reduce teen
smoking (which could raise up to $_ over 25 years). These penalties would include both a
company-by-company surcharge and stiff penalties that could raise cigarette prices by up to $1 a
pack. This option would raise cigarette prices between 60 cents and $1.60 a pack, depending on
the industry's success in reducing teen smoking.

       3. Restoration of settlement investment pledge: This option assumes the amount of
payments necessary to fund additional public health investments at a level that reflects what
some supporters of the original settlement said would be available. Under this option, the
industry would make gross payments of $ _ billion over 25 years. This option includes the
company-by-company surcharge, but not the youth penalties of up to $1 a pack. This option
would raise cigarette prices by _ cents a pack.

       4. $1.50 per pack: This option assumes the level of industry payments necessary to
increase cigarette prices by $1.50 a pack right away, which David Kessler and Rep. Waxman .
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


have urged. Under this option, the industry would make gross payments of $_ billion over 25
years.


Ways to Spend Additional Funding

        The current settlement would fund a variety of public health initiatives, including a
counteradvertising campaign; smoking cessation programs; FDA enforcement; other tobacco
control efforts; and a $4-billion-a-year trust fund that could serve as a 21st Century Research
Fund dedicated to biomedical and tobacco-related research.

       The second chart (Table -.J outlines possible uses for additional funds, if any.
