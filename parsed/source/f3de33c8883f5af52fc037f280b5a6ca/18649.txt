TEXT:
FYI -

Harold Varmus is scheduled to testify at House Commerce hearing on
cloning, Thursday, February 12.  Ehlers, Bond and Armey are also on the
list.


below is the text of HR 3133 a cloning bill (actually its a research
bill) brought by Stearns and Wicker. I think the definition they use
might be of some use.

"(a) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available in any Federal
law may be obligated or expended to conduct or support any project of
research that includes the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer
technology to produce an oocyte that is undergoing cell division toward


development of a fetus.
(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
(1) the term "human somatic cell nuclear transfer"   means transferring
the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an oocyte
from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert; and
(2) the term "somatic cell"   means a cell of an embryo,
fetus, child, or adult which is not and will not become a sperm
or egg cell."

Obviously, I don't like saying embryonic cells are somatic cells,
however, the phrase "toward development of a fetus" might give us some
wiggle room.  We could argue we are not interested in development
towards a fetus, only towards bone marrow, or skin or whatever.

Since Stearns and Wicker are both pretty solid with the Chrisitan
Coalition, the fact that the language started with them might be helpful
as well.

l05th CONGRESS
2d Session
H. R. 3133

To prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to conduct or support
research on the cloning of humans, and to express the sense of the
Congress that other countries should establish substantially equivalent
restrictions.



IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

January 28, 1998

Mr. Stearns (for himself and Mr. Wicker) introduced the following bill;
which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, and in addition to the
Committee on Science, for a period to be subsequently determined by the
Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall
within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned


A BILL



To prohibit the expenditure of Federal funds to conduct or support
research on the cloning of humans, and to express the sense of the
Congress that other countries should establish substantially equivalent
restrictions.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the


United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Human Cloning Research Prohibition Act"

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST EXPENDITURE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR RESEARCH
ON CLONING HUMANS.

(a) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available in any Federal
law may be obligated or expended to conduct or support any project of
research that includes the use of human somatic cell nuclear transfer
technology to produce an oocyte that is undergoing cell division toward
development of a fetus.
(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--
(1) the term "human somatic cell nuclear transfer"   means transferring
the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an oocyte
from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert; and
(2) the term "somatic cell" means a cell of an embryo,
fetus, child, or adult which is not and will not become a sperm
or egg cell.

SEC. 3. REVIEW.

The Director of the National Science Foundation shall enter into an
agreement with the National Research Council for a review of the
implementation of this Act. Not later than 5 years after the date of
the enactment of this Act, the Director shall transmit to the Congress
a report containing the results of that review, including the
conclusions of the National Research Council on--
 (1) the impact that the implementation of this Act has had
on research; and
 (2) recommendations for any appropriate changes to this
Act.

SEC. 4. PROTECTED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.

Nothing in this Act shall restrict other areas of scientific
research not specifically prohibited by this Act, including important
and promising work that involves--
(1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other
cloning technologies to clone molecules, DNA, cells other than
human embryo cells, or tissues; or
(2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals
other than humans.

SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTERNATIONAL PROHIBITION.

It is the sense of the Congress that each foreign country should establish
a prohibition substantially equivalent to the prohibition established in
section 2 (a) .
