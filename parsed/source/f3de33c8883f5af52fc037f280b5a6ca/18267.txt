                              Q and A on Tobacco Taxes and Budget
                                             January 5,1998

Q. Will your upcoming proposed budget rely on revenues raised from a tax on tobacco products,
and if so how much money do you believe can be raised in this manner?

A. I have said consistently that there needs to be comprehensive tobacco legislation with the
primary goal of reducing teen smoking. We are making good progress in that direction. As part
of that comprehensive approach, I have called for a combination of industry payments and
penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 over the next decade, as necessary to
meet youth smoking reduction targets. These revenues need not be a tax, and reports that indicate
that has been decided are wrong. I think it is fair to say that comprehensive tobacco legislation
should raise some revenue and that we will assume some revenues from it in our upcoming
budget.


Q. Are the revenue estimates reported in the Wall Street Journal today accurate, suggesting that
a tobacco tax would raise $10 billion for your FY '99 budget and $40 to $60 billion over five
years?

A. I won't comment on particular numbers that may still be in the drafting stage. The budget is
not finalized and obviously hasn't been released. The projected revenues we use for the budget
will be consistent with what I have called for in the past. I've said there should be a
combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50
over the next decade, as necessary to meet youth smoking reduction targets of 30% in 5 years,
50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years.
