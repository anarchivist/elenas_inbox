TEXT:
Following is a list of education events that have been proposed.   After
today's Short Term Scheduling meeting, I think we need to prioritize which
ones we want to fight for first to ensure they are scheduled, and we need
to strategize what to do with the events we may not ever schedule - like
the Chief State School Officers.

Specifically -- everyone really liked the idea of doing a Business
Roundtable.  The down side is that everyone had a different idea about
it. Ann Lewis, Cheri Carter, and Jen Palmieri thought that it may be
better to do the Business Roundtable event in Connecticut on March 10.
craig is checking to see if Dodd would want this.   If not, Child Care is
in good standing.   ( I pushed to keep child care, so please let me know if
you're more ambivalent.)   Also, the CEOs may not be able to come on that
date, so it may not be a real option. What do you all think?

In addition, there was talk of trying to combine some of our education
proposals -- (like inviting in some of the Chief State School Officers to
the Business Roundtable so that we don't have to meet with them as a
separate event, or perhaps inviting the Teacher of the Year to a
roundtable or Mayor's Conference. )

In short, I could use your help on identifying the minimum objectives for
each of these events and the general priorities.  Mike, do you have time
tomorrow to sit down and talk about this? Let me know what works for you.

3/16        Speech to Delaware State Legislature on class size

3/16        Meet w/ Chief State School Officers

tbd         Mayor's Conference on Education
