TEXT:
I've tentatively scheduled Bruce for a Sperling breakfast on the morning
of wednesday, June 2.   Only dates available next week were that and
Friday the 4th. June 2 is the date of the Air Force Academy speech, so
Bruce gives us an opportunity to get into print stories on June 3 with
something domestic -- guns, violence, whatever else.   If anybody has a
problem with this, or thinks we ought to wait, or thinks Friday would be
better, let's hear it.   (Reminder that Jack Lew is doing Sperling this
Friday. )
