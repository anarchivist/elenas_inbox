TEXT:
You asked where this issue is, and said you weren't aware we had issued it
yet.  We haven't officially issued it, because DOJ felt very strongly that
they first must consult with Rep. Lamar Smith. That happened almost a
month ago.  He insisted on seeing a copy of the OLC opinion from last
January, and then he wrote this nice letter to Reno.  The plan is for the
agencies to officially issue the definition this week or next, but the cat
is kind of out of the bag since Smith already knows.  So I don't think it
will get any attention. Also fyi, it appears that the new child health
program will end up getting classified as means-tested, but i.t' s not 100%
sure yet.
