  TEXT:
  We will need something for July 26, so we should probably try to make this
  work.  I do think calling in the NEC is a good idea.  Plus, it would be
  great to engage Cabinet secretaries of departments that have traditionally
  not made this a priority -- Labor, Commerce, SBA, Treasury. What do you
  think?
