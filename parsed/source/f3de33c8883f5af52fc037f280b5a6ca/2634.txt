TEXT:
The after school provisions are in our FY 1998 budget.  The reason it is
not in the JJ bill is jurisdictional-- the after school funding is for a
small Education Department program.

After school programs were made a part of the youth violence "strategy"
booklet we released in Boston back in February. The strategy contained
other items that were not specifically part of the JJ bill, but were
things the Administration is doing on this front.   I think we've been
careful in written statements to say that after school programs are a part
of the President's "strategy" on youth violence; but I think some,
including the President, actually think it is written into our bill.

I think Jose can speak to how we are trying to get this as an authorized
use of prevention funds in the Senate bill.

So I've reviewed the section-by-section analysis of the jj bill that you
gave me, and what I want to know is: where's the after-school stuff Rahm
is talking about?
