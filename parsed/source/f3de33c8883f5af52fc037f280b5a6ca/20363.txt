         Of the Administration's $96 million food safety initiative for USDA and FDA, we received only
         $16.8 million in the House full committee and only $2.6 million in the Senate full committee.
         The full Senate is considering the Agriculture bill, but is not expected to begin voting until
         Monday. Senators Leahy, Harkin, and Daschle are willing to work with us to offer amendments,
         but have indicated that they will only do so if we present an offset. . On Thursday, we offered an
         offset involving user fees which was rejected by Harkin's staff. OMB is continuing to work on
         some other offset proposals. DPC is working on a possible event for Wednesday which will
         highlight the problem offood safety and focus on some nonlegislative solutions already being
         undertaken. Because summer is the most dangerous time of year for food safety, we believe that
         the July 4th radio address may be a appropriate time to raise the budget and other food safety
         issues that are currently pending in Congress. In addition to your FY 1999 budget, there are
         other legislative proposals involving food safety currently pending. These proposals include
         mandatory recall for meat and poultry, civil fines for violations, and increased FDA inspection
         authority for imported foods.
