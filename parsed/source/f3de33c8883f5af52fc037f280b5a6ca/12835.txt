TEXT:
Q:      What is the federal government doing to support character
education in public schools?

A:      This administration has long-recognized that good character
education programs can improve school discipline and student behavior,
which creates an academic setting that improves student achievement. Over
the past five years, the Department of Education has supported Character
Education pilot projects in 28 states. The program helps states work in
partnership with local school districts to develop programs that help
instill common sense values in our children, and teach them the difference
between right and wrong.   Moreover, the President's recent proposal to
reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act would expand these
character education projects by removing restrictions that limit the
program to no more than a total of 10 grants per year, and $1 million for
each state over a 5-year period.
