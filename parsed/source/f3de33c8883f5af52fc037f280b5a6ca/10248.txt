                      Commission Report on Phthalates in Toys
                                December 2, 1998


Q.   What is the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) releasing today?

A.   The CPSC is releasing a report examining the potential exposure and health risks to
     children from teethers, pacifiers, rattles, and toys containing chemicals called phthalates
     (pronounced fal-ates) that are used to soften plastic. The report includes new data on the
     potential release ofDINP -- the most widely used phthalate -- when children bite, chew,
     or suck on products containing the chemical, as well as a review of existing science on
     migration of phthalates. The report also evaluates all existing data on the health effects
     of ingesting phthalates. The report concludes that the plastic toys at issue do release
     phthalates -- and so children are not exposed to phthalates -- at levels that might be
     considered even potentially harmful. The report also provides information to consumers
     about the issue, and outlines the CPSC's plans for further study.

     The CPSC also announced the plans of a number of manufacturers and retailers to
     discontinue selling certain toys containing DINP out of an abundance of cation and to
     allay any fears that customers may have about buying these products.

Q.   What is the Administration going to do in response to this report, which by saying.
     that further study is warranted seems to indicate that we don't really know whether
     products containing phthalates are harmful to children?

A.   The report shows that, based on all currently available evidence, DINP used in toys,
     teethers, and pacifiers is not released at levels that could be considered potentially
     harmful to children. But because our children's safety is of such paramount importance,
     the report also commits the CPSC to do additional research on this issue. The
     Administration will support in every way possible the CSPC's efforts to continue to
     research DINP, as well as to study alternative methods of softening plastic for use in
     children's toys.

Q.   If this report shows that there is no risk to children, why are toy manufacturers
     agreeing to phase out the use of the chemical and why are retailers removing
     products containing it from store shelves?

A.   Although the current scientific evidence does not support removal of these products, toy
     manufacturers and retailers are acting with super-abundance of caution, which we believe
     is commendable. Although this question is better directed to the manufacturers and
     retailers themselves, we assume that these companies want to make clear to their
     customers that they take every possible precaution to protect children, even where there
     appears to be no risk.

       -- acting at the request of US toy manufacturers -- influenced the European Union's
       decision not to ban phthlates. Is this true?

. A.   The report released today states that the Consumer Product Safety Commission does not
       believe that there is a scientific basis for a ban on phthalates in children's toys and other
       products. Although the Commerce and State Departments initially expressed concerns
       about whether the product bans considered (but rejected) by the European Union were
       scientifically justified , the Administration recognizes that each country has the right to
       take whatever precautionary measures it deems appropriate to protect public health. The
       President has made it clear to the Commerce and State Departments that they should
       respect any precautionary steps that foreign countries believe to be appropriate with
       respect to these products.
