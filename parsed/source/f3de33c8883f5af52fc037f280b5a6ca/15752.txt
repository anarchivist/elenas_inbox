TEXT:
Deborah Colton told Mary Bourdette that Republicans are trying to move the
Ways and Means markup until tomorrow -- because they expect the health
markup to end sooner than expected and perhaps because members want to get
home for the weekend.

This means that you folks at OMB need to pull together the draft Raines to
Shaw letter ASAP and get it circulated to us. Thanks.
