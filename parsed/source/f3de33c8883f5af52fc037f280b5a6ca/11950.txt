TEXT:
We're trying to figure if these sound like good deliverables for the hate
crimes event.   I imagine the message as two-fold --(1) we are going to be
tough on the crime (the legislation), but we also know (in this holiday
season) that in the long run it will take the whole community to teach
kids intolerance and hate are wrong.   So:

1.  POTUS, with Specter and Kennedy, talking about the need for hate
crimes legislation surrounded by supporters of the legislation including
cops, religious leaders, Mrs. Shepard (WY.) and the Byrd family (TX).  (A
picture of Shepard and Byrd and the President together would be quite
potent, perhaps too much.  Perhaps he should meet with them alone
beforehand if we were to do this) .

2.  POTUS announcing a coalition with some private companies including
AT&T and Court TV, and DOJ and Education to produce a curriculum for
middle school kids by the end of October (Youth Tolerance Day).  In
addition, we might have a directive for the President to sign to get
Education to collect hate crimes statistics form college campuses.   POTUS
can also reference a MTV survey that comes out that day on kids sense that
hate crimes is a big problem.
