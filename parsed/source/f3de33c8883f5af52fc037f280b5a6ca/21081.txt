TEXT:
1. Mary and I went over to the press conference, it looked fine-- 10
cameras including the three networks. I think the story will have trouble
breaking through.

2.   Today's WP Fed page has a leaked internal USDA memo opposing country
of origin labeling. Glickman reportedly feels this was a calculated
internal leak to lock him into this position. That bothers him and to
push back, at the press conference he made a point of saying he is going
to try and find a way to get something on labeling done. This is the best
hope for this -- getting him to move his internal and trade
bureaucracies. USDA will talk to Senator Johnson ( the sponsor) and see
if we can't come up with something.
