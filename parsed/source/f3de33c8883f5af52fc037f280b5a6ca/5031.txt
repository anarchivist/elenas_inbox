MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION

Subject: Turning Around Low-Perfonning Public Schools

         Since taking office in 1993, and with your strong leadership, my Administration has
 pursued a comprehensive effort to strengthen public schools. We have worked to raise
 academic standards, promote accountability, and provide greater competition and choice within
 the public schools, including support for a dramatic increase in charter schools. Moreover, we
 have worked to make the investments necessary to improve teaching and learning classrooms
 across America, through efforts to keep our schools safe and free of drugs; provide students who
 need it extra help to master the basics; increase parental and community involvement; recruit,
.prepare, and provide continuing training to teachers and reward excellence in teaching; and make
 sure every school has access to and can effectively use 21st Century technology.

         This strategy is starting to produce results. We know for certain that all students can
learn to high standards, and that every school can succeed if it has clear instructional goals and
high expectations for all of its students, if it creates a safe, disciplined and orderly environment
for learning, helps parents be involved in their child's education, and uses proven instructional
practices. All schools must be given the resources, the tools, and the flexibility to help every
student reach high standards.

        Yet no school improvement strategy can succeed without real accountability for results,
as measured by student achievement. Excellent schools and schools that show significant
improverilent must be recognized and rewarded. At the same time, schools that demonstrate
persistently poor academic perfonnance -- schools which fail to make adequate progress in
educating all students to high standards -- must not be ignored. No American child deserves to
get a second class education. Instead, local and state education officials must step in and
redesign failing schools, or close them down and reopen them with new, more effective
leadership and staff. .

         A growing number of states and cities have begun to take these steps. In addition to
Chicago, cities such as San Francisco, Philadelphia and New York, and states such as Maryland
and Kentucky identify low perfonning schools and take steps to intervene if these schools faii to
make progress. These steps often include the implementation of school improvement plans --
providing after-school academic help to students, strengthening training and assistance for school
staff, creating smaller and more personal settings, such as schools-wi thin-schools -- and, where
necessary, reconstitution of the school and replacement of the school principal and other staff.

       We must encourage and help more cities and states to take up the challenge oftuming
around low perfonning schools and helping the students they serve get back on the path to
meeting high standards. We can do this by making widely available infonnation on what works
and what doesn't, and by ensuring that Department of Education resources are most productively
used for these purposes.                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

       In order to accomplish this, I am directing the Department of Education to:

       1. Produce and disseminate widely guidelines on effective approaches to turning
       around low performing schools. There is much of value to be shared from the lessons
       and experiences of cities and states that have already successfully intervened in low
       performing schools, as well as from research and development on effective school
       improvement practices. We know that there are now several promising models of refom,
       ranging from the New American Schools designs to Robert Slavin's Success for All
       program. These lessons must be summarized in clear and useable formats, and made
       widely available to educators, parents, state and local policymakers, business leaders and
       others working to improve public education.

       2. Help states and cities committed to turning around low-performing schools use
       existing Department of Education resources to accomplish this goal. U.S.
       Department of Education programs should help and encourage more states and cities to
       develop sound, comprehensive approaches to turn around low performing schools and
       help students in them get a better education, and, once developed, should support their
       implementation. In particular, the Education Department should develop a strategy to
       ensure that appropriate funds provided to state and local education systems under its
       existing programs can easily and effectively be used to support efforts to turn around
       failing schools. Second, the Education Department should develop a strategy, in
       collaboration with states and cities, to provide appropriate research, dissemination and
       technical assistance resources to support state and local initiatives. Third, the Education
       Department should consider whether additional federal incentives could effectively
       increase the number of states and cities that adopt rigorous accountability policies and
       effective strategies to intervene in failing schools.

       Many Eduation Department programs are already well suited for intervening in failing
       schools, because they can be used to provide extra help to students during and after the
       school day, support high quality professional development for teachers, and plan and
       implement effective school reforms. The Education Department's should ensure that local
       school districts can access federal funds and use them in an integrated fashion to support
       their comprehensive efforts to improve low performing schools. Where there are
       statutory barriers to accomplishing this purpose they should be identified so we can work
       with the Congress to change them.                                             .

        A number of existing Department of Education programs, including Title I and Goals
2000, require participating states and school districts to hold schools accountable for results, and
provide resources that can be used for these purposes. Other existing programs also provide
resources that can be used to address key problems faced by low-performing schools, such as the
Eisenhower professional development program. The 21 st Century Schools program can help
keep schools open longer hours and provide a setting in which students can get extra help after
school. And the Public Charter Schools Program can be used to provide start-up funds to replace
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

failed schools with new charter schools, or to provide students in low performing schools with
additional choices within the public schools.

        New initiatives under consideration in Congress can also provide important help. The
Balanced Budget Agreement I reached with Congressional leaders last summer commits the
Congress to enacting an early reading program consistent with the principles of my America
Reads initiative. When fully established, this program will help mobilize an army of one million
volunteer tutors to give students who need it extra help in order to learn to read independently by
the 4th grade. These volunteers can be especially helpful for students in low performing schools.
 In addition, the bipartisan Porter-Obey Comprehensive School Reform legislation currently
under consideration by the Congress will, if funded, provide resources to assist schools
implement proven practices for improving student learning. This can be particularly helpful to
low performing schools.

       Together, these initiatives can help local school districts turn failing schools into
successful schools by improving teacher training, strengthening instructional practices,
overhauling school management and implementing schoolwide reforms. They can provide
students who need it extra help, during and after school. And they can provide students with
additional choices within the public schools.
