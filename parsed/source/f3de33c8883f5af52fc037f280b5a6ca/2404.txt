                               Senator Gramm's Marriage Penalty Proposal                           onversion 'Ystem

     Proposal

     The proposal would give a deduction of$3,450 (in 1999) to married couples filing a joint return
     who have combined incomes below $50,000. (This $3,450 deduction is the difference between
     the sum of the standard deductions for a single filer and a head of household filer and the
     standard deduction for a joint filer.) The deduction would be available to all such couples,
     whether or not they itemized deductions (i.e., the deduction would be "above-the-line"). Since
     couples in this income range are in the 15 percent bracket, the deduction is worth $518 as long as
     they have sufficient tax liability. The deduction also reduces income for purposes of the
     phaseout of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), so couples with incomes in the phaseout
     range of the EITC will get a larger credit.

     ExampJe.   For a couple with two children and $30,000 of wage income, taxes would decline by
     $1,244. The decline is larger than $518 because this couple would receive a larger EITC. For
     couples with income above approximately $32,000 (and below $50,000), the tax cut would
     normally be $518.

     Pros
         o   Gives a tax cut to 20.1 million filers which is quite progressive, since only couples with
             income below $50,000 would benefit.

         o   Would extend the EITC to additional low-income working families, and increase the
             EITC for many current recipients.

     Cons

         o   Would cost $46.4 billion through 2003, and approximately $10.5 billion per year after
             2003. This would crowd out much of the proposed expenditures in the tobacco bill.

         o   The proposal has little to do with marriage penalties (other than the fact that it is giving a
             significant tax cut only to married taxpayers).

                    For example, a one-earner childless couple with $50,000 of income already has a
                    marriage bonus of over $3,000; the proposal would simply increase this bonus.
                    The marriage penalty for a childless two-earner couple, each with $25,000 of
                    income, is only about $200; the proposal would more than eliminate this penalty.

                    Only about 40 percent of the revenue loss would actually reduce marriage penalties.

         o      The provision would create a "cliff," whereby couples with $50,000 of income would get
                a tax cut of $518 while a couple with $1 more of income would get nothing. This
                creates large disincentives to earn income or large incentives to misreport income for
                taxpayers with incomes above the cliff



                          Alternative to Gramm Marriage Penalty Proposal:
                                     A "Mini-Gralnm" Proposal

     Proposal

     The cost of the Gramm proposal could be substantially reduced by basing the deduction on the
     difference between the sum of the standard deductions for two single filers and the standard
     deduction for a joint filer (this would make the deduction $1,450 in 1999). The deduction could
     also be phased in, 25 percent in 1999, 70 percent in 2000, and 100 percent beginning in 2001.
     In addition, the c1iffwould be removed by phasing out the deduction by $0.10 for each $1.00 of
     income above $50,000. The $50,000 income limit would be indexed after 1999, as in the
     Gramm proposal, but using a $1,000 round down rule (rather than the $5,000 round down rule in
     the Gramm proposal).                                                             .

     In 1999 the deduction would be 25% x $1,450 = $362.50, which would have a tax value at 15
     percent of $54. When fully phased in, the deduction (at the 1999 level of$I,450) would have
     a tax value of $218.                          .

     Example. Using the fully phased in value of the deduction at 1999 levels, for a couple with two
     children and $30,000 of wage income, taxes would decline by $523. The decline is larger than
     $218 because this couple would receive a larger BITe. For couples with income above
     approximately $32,000 (and below $50,000), the tax cut would normally be $218. Couples
     with incomes between $50,000 and $64,500 (where the phaseout of the deduction would end)
     would receive some tax cut.

     Advantages Relative to the Gramm Proposal

         o   The cost of this "Mini-Gramm" proposal would be $19.3 billion through 2003 and
             approximately $5.7 billion per year after 2003,.about half the cost of the full Gramm
             proposal.

         o This proposal would provide a tax cut to more couples (27.3 million versus 20.1
           million), because of the phaseout of the deduction above $50,000 of income.


     Disadvantages Relative to the Gramm Proposal

         o   Most of the revenue loss would still go to marriage bonuses.

         o This proposal is less progressive than the full Gramm proposal, although nearly all of the
           tax cut, over 83 percent, would still go to couples with incomes below $50,000.
                                                                            Hex-Dump co~:g~%~nt System
                       Alternative to Gramm Marriage Penalty Proposal:
           Increase Standard Deduction for Joint Filers to Double the Single Amount

Proposal

The standard deduction for joint filers would be increased to double the amount for single filers
(this increase would be $1,450 in 1999). The increase in the standard deduction would also
reduce income for purposes of the phaseout of the EITC. The increase would be phased in, 25
percent in 1999, 50 percent in 2000, 75 percent in 2001 and 100 percent beginning in 2002.

In 1999 the increase in the standard deduction for joint filers would be 25% x $1,450 = $362.50,
which would have a tax value for couples in the 15 percent bracket of $54 and $102 for couples
in the 28 percent bracket. When fully phased in, the increase in the standard deduction (at the
1999 level of $1 ,450) would have a tax value of $218 for couples in the 15 percent bracket, and .
$406 for couples in the 28 percent bracket.

Example.    Using the fully phased in value of the increase in the standard deduction at 1999
levels, for a couple with two children who use the standard deduction and have $30,000 of
wage income, taxes would decline by $523. The decline is larger than $218 because this couple
would receive a larger EITe. Couples who itemize deductions with incomes below roughly
$32,000 would have modest tax reductions because of the change in the EITe phaseout.

Advantages Relative to the Gramm Proposal

    o   The cost of this proposal would be $20.0 billion through 2003 and approximately $6.8
        billion per year after 2003.

    o   The proposal would simplifY filing, reducing the number of filers who itemize
        deductions by 3.1 million (from 39.2 million to 36.1 million). (These counts, and
        those given below, are based on fully phased in levels of the increase in the standard
        deduction in 1999.)

              The Gramm proposal would make tax returns and filing somewhat more complex.

    o   This proposal is more efficiently targeted at reducing marriage penalties than the Gramm
        proposal, with more than 50 percent of the revenue loss directly reducing marriage
        penalties (the corresponding figure for the Gramm proposal is 40 percent).

    o   More couples (26.1 million versus 20.1 million) would receive a tax cut under this
        proposal than under the Gramm proposal.

Disadvantages Relative to the Gramm Proposal

    o   The proposal is less progressive than the full Gramm proposal, with 62 percent ofthe
        benefits would go to couples with incomes below $50,000, and over 95 percent would
        go to couples with incomes below $100,000.
