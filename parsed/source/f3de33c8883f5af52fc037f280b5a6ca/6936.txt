TEXT:
Here's what I've learned so far:  Under the law, prisoners are not to be
included in households in determining food stamp allotments. Last year,
after GAO reported that this happens too often, Congress passed a law
requiring states to establish "systems to verify and ensure" that
prisoners aren't counted in households.  This can include data matching
programs with prisons and/or SSA. The law requires all states to do this
by 8/1/98, although USDA can grant 1-year extensions to states.

However, SSA won't be ready to share federal data with states by August,
because it hasn't worked out all the bugs of such a system.   States can
still meet the requirement if SSA isn't ready, for example by matching
data with prisons directly.  But SSA has the best data and the law
specifically says that states that use SSA data are automatically in
compliance.   USDA is having a big meeting in 2 weeks with a few states,
SSA, and prison people to figure out what kind of system is required.
There are also privacy issues.

(FYI, there is a similar push on the dead, although that may not be such
good fodder for a radio address. GAO just did a report on food stamps
going to the dead, and Lugar is doing a hearing on this April 23.   SSA
also has good data on the dead, so at the hearing USDA has to say whether
SSA and USDA can share data on this.)
