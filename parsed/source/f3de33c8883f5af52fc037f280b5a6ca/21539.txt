TEXT:
As you may know from the papers, the Supreme Court has accepted for
expedited review Anderson v. Roe, a case challenging Calif,ornia's policy
of providing lower welfare benefits to new state residents.

HHS and DOJ are currently reviewing the case and plan to make a
recommendation to us and counsel's office as to whether we should file a
brief in the case. The U.S. is not a party to the suit (only the state of
California was sued), so we are not required to do anything.  As you may
recall, the welfare law made such two-tiered benefits an explicit state
option.

Briefs would need to be filed by Nov. 7th. Harriet Rabb is currently
leaning towards staying out of the case altogether (we did so on a
previous case, Green v. Anderson). Other options include filing on behalf
of one side (California or plaintiff) or filing a brief explaining our
understanding of the statute.

Harriet sent a note to Chuck Ruff saying they are looking into this.   She
and Marcy Wilder of her office are working with Ed Needler at Justice.

In a week or so when Justice and HHS have gathered their thoughts, I
assume we'd want to have them over here to discuss and Elena, I assume you
would want to be there.
