TEXT:
Have you received any word from CEA on the report that was due last
Wednesday?

If we had something on paper that we could share with the Advisory Board
on Monday that would be very helpful to 1) show them that we are actively
working at this (which is EBB's keen interest) and 2) reinforce the
primary role of the White House as initiative-driver.  I realize it is
just a list, but I think that would help greatly.

Please let me know what you've heard.         Thanks.
