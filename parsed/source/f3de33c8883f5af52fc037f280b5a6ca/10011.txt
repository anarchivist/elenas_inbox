I am not particularly pleased.   I just saw a version of the new ideas memo
and noticed that we gave the NEC credit for my ATM idea. That is complete
bullshit.   I am not coming up with stuff anymore that other people take
credit for.

I am also mad that Private Activity Bonds was taken out of the list. You
should have asked me about that before cutting it out. That is one of the
few ideas that will definitely pass next year.  If I am going to do have
to do Community Empowerment, than I expect to be consulted as the policy
expert.
