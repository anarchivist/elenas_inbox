TEXT:
Over the weekend, I spoke with a mother in the Army who could be put on
Panel 2, but if we are not promoting DoD so much, Melanne thought it
better if we not put her on the Panel. The woman I spoke with would be
fine, but not add all that much.

As a result, my latest idea is to find a parent (in the next 24 hours) who
started an Early Childhood PTA in order to share information with other
parents of children 0-5 and get involved in their child's child care or
preschool program. According to Eliz Drye, the POTUS was very excited
about early childhood PTAs when he heard about them on his trip to Georgia
after the SOTU. I like the idea for several reasons, including because it
is not a low-income initiative and would reinforce our message that this
is for everyone. What do you think?
