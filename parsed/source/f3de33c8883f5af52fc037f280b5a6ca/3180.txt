TEXT:
I would like for you and I (and whoever else --eg Nicole) to get together soon
to talk about this issue.
As you may recall the Crime Prevention Council some time ago had all our
agencies discuss what they are doing and then hear from a number of
community-based organizations, police oranizations etc about what they are
doing. And there have been, as you know, mUltiple other things going on--Service
Summit, relationship to the 0-3, some part of the Family Conference, legislative
initiative, Dept. of Ed booklet and First Lady announcement, etc etc--and then
lots of discussion outside the government too.
The World Hunger group is working with a number of the best in the field on a
Conference for potentially this fall and discussion teaming up with CNS--and
they have all been talking with us. And it goes on.
The long and the short is that I want to talk with you on how all this fits with
the followup to the 0-3, how the Administration might want to integrate/lead in
this area and all the other thoughts I am sure you are having!
I will be out next week but want to at least touch base the weeek after or you
can page me before and I will call you.  Thanks.
