Subject: State of Oregon to provide DP benefits

Eugene Register-Guard, April 23, 1998
Eugene, OR

By TAD SHANNON
    Domestic partners of state employees will be eligible for health
benefits
starting June 1, a state panel has decided.
    The unanimous vote Tuesday by the Public Employees' Benefit Board
applies
to all of the state's approximately 45,000 employees. The decision adds
Oregon
to a growing list of states, cities and private companies that have
extended .
benefits to cohabiting couples, whether they are gay or heterosexual but
unmarried.
    "It's great news," said Kelly Matchett-Morris, one of two gay UO
employees
who filed separate lawsuits last year alleging that the university
discriminated against them by denying health benefits to their partners.
"It's
finally the right thing being done."
    Matchett-Morris, associate director of residence life, said he and his
partner probably will drop their lawsuit now. "We made a decision not to
sue
for damages or lost wages," he said. "We really wanted the university to do
the right thing, period."
    The state's most prominent anti-gay rights organization, however,
denounced
the board's decision as immoral.
    "It reinforces what we've been concerned about for a long time," said
Lon
Mabon, chairman of the Oregon Citizens Alliance, which ~as sponsored


 several
 statewide anti-gay rights initiatives. "The government shouldn't be in the
 business of sanctioning immoral sexual behavior."
     The OCA is collecting signatures to place an initiative on the November
 ballot that Mabon said would prohibit the state from recognizing homosexual
 marriages and would ban extending benefits to unmarried couples. Mabon said
 the group has about half of the 97,000 signatures it needs by July.
     The benefit board's decision sets in motion a policy that has been hotly
 debated for years in Oregon and around the country. The city of Eugene
 extended such benefits earlier this year, joining the Eugene Water &
 Electric
 Board, the city of Portland and Multnomah County.
     In the private sector, such large Oregon employers as Sony Corp. in
 Springfield, Intel, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard offer such cove
 rage.
 Nationwide, the states of New York and Vermont have adopted similar
 policies,
 along with an estimated 80 other government entities and a couple of
 hundre.d
 companies.
     Supporters say it's only fair and makes good business sense in a
 competitive labor market.
     "I see it as a good thing," said Linda King, UO director of human
 resources. "Anything that makes us a more attractive employer helps in
 recruitment and retention. It also seems more equitable for our employees."
     King said she expects that fewer than 50 of the university's 3,100
 employees will seek coverage for a domestic partner.
     Mylia Wray, administrator of the Public Employees' Benefit Board;
 estimates
 that 200 to 400 state employees will seek benefits. Based on the
 experience of
 employers nationwide, she said she expects an increase of no more than 1
 percent of the $180 million the state spends on benefits each year. Because
 the policy will take effect midyear, she expects this year's increase to be
 closer to $400,000.
     The board voted in January to extend benefits but made the decision
'contingent on the outcome of a lawsuit filed by three gay employees of
 Oregon
 Health Sciences University. The case is before the Oregon Court of Appeals.
     A Multnomah County Circuit Court judge ruled in 1996 that OHSU had to
 extend benefits because failing to do so would violate the Oregon
 Constitution. The state appealed, hoping to resolve who has the authority
 to
 extend such benefits, among other issues.
     The state attorney general's office advised the benefit board to hold
 off.
 But now, the office thinks the court may not address the issue, so it gave
 the
 board a green light.
     "We think the legal landscape has changed," said David Schuman, deputy
 attorney general. For one thing, action by the Legislature that took effect
 Jan. 1 merged two boards to create the Public Employees' Benefit Board and
 gave the new board more authority.
     Although the policy appears to have been decided for now, debate
 probably
 won't die any time soon.
     "For myself, it's not the direction I'd like to see us go," said Senate
 Majority Leader Gene Derfler, R-Salem.
     It would be too easy for someone to abuse the rule, he said.
     "If I were a person with an illness, I'd love to go find a domestic
  ', ...


partner," he said. "I don't think it's fair to the taxpayer."
