TEXT:
I have a new idea for how we might bridge the remaining gap with the civil
rights groups, while retaining our language requiring state policies to
require kids to meet standards before being promoted.  In our con~ersation,
Bill and Jenell were convinced that our language would require retention of
kids who didn't meet the standards, even after receiving all of the
"continuing comprehensive interventions" that we now require.  Bill in
particular has consistently been concerned that we are leaving no choice
but
retention for kids who are still not making it after all this help.

What if we added something to our proposal, requiring local districts to
have a procedure for determining the appropriate placement and
instructional
program that is reasonably calculated to best help the student meet
standards and progress through school, for a student who does not meet
promotion standards, even after receiving all of the comprehensive
interventions we already require.  This "last chance" approach would leave
districts a range of options, from retention to promotion to anything in
between, depending upon what it thinks will work best for the kid.  I think
this might satisfy Bill.

While this may create a giant loophole (though it shouldn't if we write it
so it is clear it is a last resort), its not without precedent.  I've been
reviewing descriptions of state and local social promotion policies that
Judith Johnson's staff has assembled, and have found that a number of
state/local policies have explicit escape hatches, permitting schools to
decide to promote kids even if they haven't met the standards.  For
example:

California permits a student's teacher to recommend against retaining a
student, with a written determination that specifies the reasons that
retention is not appropriate and with recommendations for appropriate
interventions.
  ·


Delaware requires kids who don't meet standards to attend summer
school--and
then requires an individual improvement plan for a kid who still doesn't
meet standards after summer school.

Louisiana allows for a variety of options (retention, remediation,
alternative placement, or anything else that will work) for kids who don't
meet proficiency levels.

North Carolina permits an appeals committee of teachers, principals, and
parents to waive the retention if the teacher or parent provides
documentation (e.g., examples of student work) that the kid is on grade
level.

What do you think?
