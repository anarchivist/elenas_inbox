             Bruce, Elana, and Mike,



     Sarah Lichtman on my staff recently went to a DPC meeting on the federal
     work
     study aspect of welfare to work.  I understand we are thinking about
     sending
     out a letter from the two Secretaries to the states to give some guidance
     on
     how to handle work-study and whether it should or will count as work.

     This does not seem to me to be a difficult question.  Folks who are on
     work-study shelf books, clean labs, tutor children, file materials,
     transcribe data, process student aid applications, meet and guide parents
     and
     future students around campus. etc .. This is work by any measure.   Thus
     it
     seems entirely appropriate that a welfare participant's 8-15 hours or more
     on
     work-study, should count toward fulfillment of their welfare work
     requirement. We should make it clear to the states that we think that is
     our
     preferred position and figure out a way to let work-study participants
     know
     that we support this interpretation, but that the state makes the final
     determination.

     The latest version of the draft letter takes a less clear position.    If
     we
     send out a letter, it should be clear on our position and it should be
     strong.   Call Sarah Lichtman on my staff at:  202-260-1728 or e-mail me
     back
     with your thoughts.  I will not be back in the office until Thursday, but
     am
     reachable bye-mail.

     Since we are under the time constraints of school starting, please let me
     know the outcome and how I can be helpful.
