TEXT:
All:
I just spoke with Earl from Labor.  Secretary Herman has had a couple of
phone conversations with Sen. Coverdell today, and he was unpersuaded to
release their nominee based on our reform committments. Labor is sending
out the letter that reflects what we are doing to Abraham, Smith, Kennedy
and Watt (with cc; to the rest of the committee members) today.

Earl is also forwarding to me a summary of what Coverdell was asking for.

Julie
