wanted to share this note with you.
I guess they don't see this getting settled this afternoon.        I was
sort of hoping it might.

Jack and I are stuck working out appeal issues this afternoon and we won't be
able to attend the meetings.  Sorry about that, Ken is interested in these
issues and does want to be involved.  I just wanted to leave two thoughts with
you for the meetings:

First, on the issue of charitible institutions. Jack and I have been
discussing this one and what the exemption should mean. We agreed with HHS
that a charitable hospital might provide services without doing an immigration
status check and then later be unable to seek reimbursement from the Medicaid.
That was the case under prior law too. Many hospitals provided services to
illegals and than later discovered that the individual does not qualify for
medicaid, leaving the hospital with no federal reimbursement.

The question is whether the charitable institution exemption should be read to
mean that the hospital or foster care provider can be reimbursed for these
services after the fact.  Jack and I haven't settled the question amongst
ourselves. However, we do feel that there is a difference between a non-profit
hospital seeking reimbursement for Medicaid and a non-profit clinic operating
with a grant providing public health benefits ability to check for status.  It


is this distinction that may drive the final resolution. I don't think this one
will get settled right away.

Second, I am curious whether HHS and the agencies plan to propose a definition
of "federal public benefits" equal to or very similar to "federal means tested
benefits".  I don't think that is reasonable or practical.   Please keep your
eye out for this one.
