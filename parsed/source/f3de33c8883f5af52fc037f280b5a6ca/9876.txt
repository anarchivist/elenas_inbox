    Ending Taxability of AmeriCorps Award. Change the tax status of AmeriCorps
    education awards so that they are not taxable. Comparable benefits, including the GI Bill,
    are not taxable. This tax liability has caused economic hardship, particularly for former
    AmeriCorps members who are enrolled in college full-time after completing their service
    and do not have the resources to pay the tax. Cost: $6-11 million (due to a recent ruling by
    the IRS, this estimate is expected to be revised downward shortly).

    Expand AmeriCorps for After School. Expand service programs to provide volunteers to
    serve as afterschool and summer school coordinators, tutors and mentors. (1) Expand
    AmeriCorps. Increase the availability of afterschool and summer programming for children
    while providing additional opportunities for young adults to earn money for college through
    service. Cost: $80 million for 10,000 AmeriCorps members providing combination of
    after-school and summer-school programs for 100,000 students (assumes 50 community
    match). (2)AmeriCorps*Seniors: Expand and rename existing demonstration program currently
    providing 1,000 seniors to 9 sites for tutoring and mentoring activities. In exchange for
    providing 15-20 hours service per week, seniors are eligible for incentives including, a small
    lifelong learning award or an offset on the cost of prescription drugs. Evaluations have shown
    increased test scores among the participating students and increased community involvement in
    the local schools. Cost: $2-3 million for 10,000 AmeriCorps Seniors.

    Encourage High Schools to Offer/Require Service Learning. The Learn and Serve America
    program provides formula grants to states to implement school-based service activities. CNS is
    proposing the addition of a competitive component targeted toward large-scale implementation
    of service programs in schools. Some states and districts, including Maryland, Chicago, and (est.
    fall 1999) California are integrating service into their graduation requirements. This proposal
    would target technical assistance, including school-based service coordinators and curriculum
    implementation, for those states and districts that are implementing service learning programs
    and/or requirements. Cost: CNS has requested $80 million, an increase of $37 million· for FY
    2000.
