TEXT:
We think it's fine to say rolls are at lowest level (number of people on
the rolls) or below 8 million for 1st time in 30 years.   Either way, the
benchmark is 1969.  Since we're now in 1999, 1999 - 1969 = 30 years (the
caseload data we're using is from 9/98, so we'd been saying 29 years).
using this same approach, we could now also say the percent of the U.S.
population is at its lowest in 31 years (since 1968).   If you're OK w/
this approach, I'll let speechwriting know (they've asked for back-up on
the caseload declines and Partnership 10,000 businesses).
