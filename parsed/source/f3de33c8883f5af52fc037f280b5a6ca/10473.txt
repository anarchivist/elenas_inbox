                    PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCES SIGNIFICANT
                         INCREASE IN HOMELESS ASSISTANCE
                   FOR FY2000 BUDGET AND $850 MILLION IN GRANTS
                  TO HELP MORE THAN 330,000 HOMELESS AMERICANS
                                  December 23, 1998

Today President Clinton will announce that his Fiscal Year 2000 budget will include $1.125
billion in homeless assistance, a more than 15 percent increase over the $975 million enacted last
year.      President Clinton also will announce that HUD is awarding $850 million in grants to
help more than 330,000 homeless people obtain housing and receive vital social services to reach
self-sufficiency. The grants, issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD), are part of President Clinton's Continuum of Care strategy to create safe, affordable
housing and break the cycle of homelessness.                     .

Fiscal Year 2000 Budget

The President will announce that his FY2000 budget for HUD includes $1.125 billion for
homeless assistance. The budget includes $1.025 billion for homeless grant programs and $100
million for 18,000 additional Section 8 vouchers targeted to help homeless people move from
homeless facilities into permanent residences. If enacted, the $1.125 billion will be the largest
ever appropriation to HUD for homeless assistance. The budget request represents a more than
15 percent increase above the $975 million that was enacted for HUD homeless programs for FY
1999.

Continuum of Care Grants for the Homeless

The President will announce $700 million in Continuum of Care competitive grants to help
homeless persons in 307 communities located in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto
Rico. The grants provide homeless people with transitional and permanent housing and fund
social services such as job training, child care, substance abuse treatment, and mental health
services. The grants are provided under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act and
fund 1420 individual projects including more than 1000 non-profit organizations. The non-profit
organizations receiving funds include local chapters of the Salvation Army, Volunteers of
America, and Catholic Charities.

Emergency Shelter Grants

The President will also announce $150 million in funding for the Emergency Shelter Grants
program. Under this program, states and cities select local projects to receive funding for
emergency shelter and other homeless needs. The funds are distributed through a formula based
on a community's housing and poverty needs. Attached is a state by state list of funds that will




     be distributed under the Continuum of Care and Emergency Shelter Grants program.

     President Clinton's Continuum of Care Program to End the Cycle of Homelessness
     President Clinton's Continuum of Care program, initiated in 1993, requires local public and
     private agencies to work together to create a comprehensive plan to address the needs of poor
     and homeless pe9ple, and to coordinate services to use resources most efficiendy. The goal of
     the Continuum of Care strategy is to give communities the decision-making authority to craft
     plans that move away from short-term emergency measures and toward permanent solutions that
     help homeless people become self-sufficient. The key elements are outreach and assessment;
     emergency shelter; transitional housing and services; permanent housing; and permanent
     supportive housing. Under the Continuum of Care program, each community submits a list of
     priority projects to HUD. The applications are evaluated on the basis of the strategy for
     addressing homelessness, including the coordination and involvement of federal, state and local
     agencies, nonprofit organizations, homeless persons, and in many cases, local businesses. Since
     taking office in 1993, President Clinton has overseen a more than 70 percent increase in
     McKinney Act homeless assistance. In 1998, Harvard University's Kennedy School of
     Government and the Ford Foundation recognized the Continuum of Care policy as one of the 25
     finalists in Innovations in American Government.

     community need, including poverty, population, housing overcrowding, age of housing,
     and growth.                .

Q:   How many persons are homeless in the United States? Why are they homeless?

A:   The Administration's Priority: Home! The Federal Plan to Break the Cycle of
     Homelessness states that there are as many as 600,000 homeless men, women, and
     children in the United States on any given night. The homeless population is a diverse
     group whose homelessness has been caused by a complex array of factors ranging from
     economic difficulties and lack of access to affordable housing to mental illness and
     problems with substance abuse. Approximately 20-25% of the homeless population is
     made up offamilies with children. An estimated one-third of the homeless population is
     experiencing mental illness, while at least 50% of those who are homeless may have
     substance abuse issues. Some have become homeless as a result of domestic violence,
     while others were forced into homelessness by a health crisis, such as HIV/AIDS.
     Roughly a third of the entire male adult homeless population are veterans, and as many as
     half of all homeless adult men have some kind of military experience.

Q:   What has the Clinton Administration done to address homelessness?

A:   President Clinton has made addressing homeless ness a top priority. Since taking office
     in 1993, President Clinton has overseen a more than 70 percent increase in McKinney Act
     homeless assistance, and the Administration has implemented the Continuum of Care
     approach to homelessness. This approach encourages communities to plan
     comprehensively for the full range of needs of poor and homeless people, and to
     coordinate services in a way that maximizes the impact of existing resources.

Q:   What specifically is the Continuum of Care?

A:    In 1993, HUD initiated a new strategy for reducing homelessness, requiring

                                              2                Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
     coordinated community approach which focuses on ensuring that homeless persons move
     from homelessness into jobs and permanent housing. The key elements of a Continuum
     of Care community plan are: outreach and assessment; emergency shelter; transitional
     housing and services; permanent housing; and permanent supportive housing.

     Under the innovative Continuum of Care program, each community submits a list of
     priority projects to HUD. The applications are evaluated on the basis of a number of
     factors, including the strategy for addressing homeless ness, as well as the coordination and
     involvement of federal, state and local agencies, nonprofit organizations, homeless
     persons, and in many cases, local businesses.

Q:   How is the Continuum of Care approach working?

A:   The results of the Continuum of Care efforts over the last few years were documented in
     a 1996 report from the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy. The stu~y found that
     as a result of such efforts, between 4 to 14 times as many homeless persons are
     receiving a wide-array of assistance to help them move into jobs and housing. The
     study also indicated that the number of children being assisted has grown from 6,500 in
     1992 to 89,000 in 1995. The report pointed to a significant transformation in the way
     communities are addressing homeless ness. The fragmented approach of the past has been
     replaced by comprehensive planning and coordinated housing and service delivery. The
     success of the Continuum of Care approach was recently recognized when it was named
     one of 25 finalists for the prestigious Harvard-Ford Foundation Innovations in
     Government Award.


Q:   How much McKinney Act funding is in the FY '99 budget?

A:   RUD'S McKinney Act homeless assistance is funded at $975 million in FY 1999, an
     increase of$152 million or 18 percent over the 1998 enacted level of$823 million. This
     is also an increase of $403.4 million or 71 percent over the 1993 enacted level of$571.6
     million.

Q:   What McKinney Act programs are the grants awarded under?

A:   These grants are part of the StewartB. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act which is the
     main federal program addressing homeless ness. These grants provide funding under
     four HUD McKinney Act programs: the Emergency Shelter Grants program, the
     Supportive Housing Program (SHP); the Shelter Plus Care (S+C) program; and the
     Section 8 Mod Rehab Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program.
