                             WELFARE REFORM IN MICHIGAN

        Over the last four years, welfare rolls have declined dramatically in Michigan and child
support collections have increased. Between January 1993 and November 1996, the number of
people on welfare in Michigan decreased by 30 percent or 208,274 people; nationwide, the
welfare caseload declined by 18 percent or nearly 2.5 million people. Michigan's percentage
reduction ranks 16th among the states (Wisconsin's 44 percent decline is largest). Michigan
increased child support collections by $165 million, or 21.2 percent, from fiscal year 1992 to
fiscal year 1996. At the same time, the state doubled the number of paternities established, from
29,087 to 60,827.
                                                                                   /


        In the state there is a great political battle over credit for the lower welfare caseloads.
According to staff of Speaker Hertell, Assembly Democrats think the good economy, for which
they think the President is greatly responsible, is the primary reason for the caseload decline.
(Michigan's unemployment rate, 7.0 percent in 1993, fell to 4.2 percent in November 1996.)

        Democrats re-took the Assembly last fall and their major welfare-to-work proposal this
session is a state earned income tax credit. The measure proposed by Rep. John F. Freeman of
Royal Oak, would allow a family of four who claims a $2,400 EITC on their federal income tax
return to claim a $240 tax credit on their state return. The measure was reported out of the
committee on Wednesday, February 26th and is expected to pass the Assembly (but may not pass
the Republican-controlled Senate). State Democrats think praise from the President could give
this proposal legs.

        The one thing Governor Engler and the state Democrats can agree upon is "Project Zero",
a demonstration project in six sites around the state which provides intensive social services
(child care, education, transportation, job placement) with the goal of achieving 100%
employment. In January 1997,54% of welfare recipients at these sites were working. In this
pilot, welfare recipients receive intensive case management (including home visits if they don't
attend work). The state spends extra funds for staff, child care, and transportation at these sites
and the Governor's budget proposes to expand it to an additional six sites. The President could
use Project Zero as way of arguing that as we move people off welfare into work and insist they
take responsibility for their own lives, we must ensure their child is cared for, that they don't lose
their health care, and they can get to their jobs. Child care spending in Michigan has increased
300% since 1991, Governor Engler's staff say.

       Michigan is best known not for Project Zero but the tough new welfare rules imposed
under President Clinton's reform-minded waiver policy. In both October 1994 and June 1996,
President Clinton granted waivers to expand Michigan's "To Strengthen Michigan Families"
program. The program encourages work and responsibility by:
       · Cutting grants by 25 percent for those who refuse to work or go to school and
           eliminating assistance for those who refuse to cooperate for 12 months;
       · Requiring minor teen parents to live in approved, adult-supervised settings and
           attend school as conditions of eligibility.
       · Revoking drivers' licenses of parents who don't pay child support or don't allow the
           other parent visitation rights.
       While Michigan's program allows them to subsidize jobs for welfare recipients, it is not a
widely used option.

                                                                                                  3/5/97
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

       There is strong evidence that Michigan's program has been successful state-wide. In
January, 31 percent of welfare recipients had earnings averaging $466 a month. A June 1996
evaluation of the To Stengthen Michigan Families program conducted by Abt Associates found
that welfare recipients randomly assigned to the program had earnings 11 % higher than those
assigned to a control group, half the impact of the GAIN program in California.

        Michigan will continue its welfare reform program, with some minor changes, under the
new welfare law. The state plans to use its own dollars to provide assistance to all adults who
comply with program rules (despite the five year limit on use of federal funds). The governor's
staff says the state provides cash assistance (using block grant dollars) and Medicaid to those
legal immigrants in the U.S. before August 22, 1996 and who were eligible for AFDC or
Medicaid. They do not use block grant dollars to provide cash assistance to SSI or food stamp
recipients cut off because of the welfare law meaningly, generally, that poor families with kids
will get cash assistance and other disabled individuals and other adults will not. Legal
immigrants who arrive in the U.S. after August 22, 1996 will be banned from assistance for five
years as required by the federal welfare law and then will be eligible. Currently, in Michigan
some legal immigrants banned from SSI may be eligible for a state-funded disability program.
The Governor's budget would prevent this, banning legal immigrants cut off of SSI from the
state disability program. He needs legislation to accomplish this, and Democrats plan to fight
him every step of the way. Because of this brewing battle, it may be best not to praise
Michigan's immigration policy but simply to simply say the welfare bill's ban is unworthy of a
great nation of immigrants.
