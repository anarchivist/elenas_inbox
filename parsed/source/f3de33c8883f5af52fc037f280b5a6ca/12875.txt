                                   Question and Answer
                                      June 4,1999


Q:   This morning on Good Morning America, the President said he would support
     requiring gun owners to register their guns. Why didn't the President propose this
     earlier? Is this something you are going to push for as the Congress considers gun
     legislation?

A:   Last April, the President proposed the most comprehensive gun legislation put forward by
     any Administration in 30 years. We are pleased that the Senate passed a number of the
     President's proposals, including requiring background checks at gun shows, and
     mandating safety locks for handguns. But we will push the House to move forward --
     not backward -- on gun legislation, to include even more of the President's proposals
     such as raising the handgun age from 18 to 21 and requiring background checks for
     explosives purchases.

     As the President indicated this morning, we do not intend to pursue gun registration in the
     context of the legislation currently under consideration by the Congress, and we have no
     intention to introduce such legislation. The President made very clear that we are
     focused on the common sense steps we can take now to keep guns out of the hands of
     kids and criminals. We cannot allow the Congress to buckle under the NRA and delay
     or undermine passage of these sensible measures that will help save lives. And if the
     Congress fails to pass all of the measures contained in President's bill, we will continue
     to keep the pressure on Congress to do so.
