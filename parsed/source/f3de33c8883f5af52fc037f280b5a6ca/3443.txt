Cynthia, I think your ~genda looks fine and agree with your points in the
e-mail.  I mentioned to Elena that I will likely be late to the Rep. Levin
Mtg. since the President will be meeting with the bipartisan Congressional
leadership and budget agreement Members of interest tomorrow at lOam.
I'll try to get there as soon as I can but I think you can carry it with
the rest of the team. Hopefully Saturday's session will have proven
helpful in getting through this meeting.  Please explain my absence if appr
opriate. Maybe you and I can chat by phone in the morning. Thanks. Janet.
