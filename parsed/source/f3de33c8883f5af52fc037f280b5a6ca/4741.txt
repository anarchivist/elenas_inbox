        DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
                                                                                    October
        9, 1997
                                                                                              (Hou

        H.R. 2570 - Forced Abortion Condemnation Act
        (Fowler (R) Florida and 12 cosponsors)

        The Administration agrees with the proponents of H.R. 2570 that the
        practice of forced abortion and involuntary sterilization is abhorrent.
        The Administration, however, strongly opposes H.R. 2570 on several
        grounds.

        The Administration opposes the bill because it would:

        o       Contradict u.S. policy to expand dialogue with the Chinese in
        order to advance critical U. S,. security, political, economic, and human
        rights interests.

        o       possibly prompt China to impose its own visa restriction that
        could further limit the ability of u.S. officials to advocate views in
        China.

        o       Raise serious constitutional concerns to the extent that it would
        inhibit the PresidentD,s ability to conduct the foreign relations of the
        united States and to receive foreign government officials.

        o       Fail to take account of u.S. international obligations to admit
        certain foreigners to the United Nations and other international
        organizations.

        o       Require the State Department to divert scarce resources from core
        tasks to comply with the requirement to maintain lists of officials
        covered by the bill.

        U. S. interests are best served by increasing the ,transparency of Chinese
        society and promoting expansion of ChinaD,s participation in international

'.

          fora governed by standards and rules agreed to by the international
          community of nations. u.s. engagement exposes Chinese officials
          first-hand to the benefits of an open and democratic system. There is no
          better way to demonstrate the advantages of a free and open society than
          to let them experience it for themselves.

          In addition, the Administration is concerned that this and other China
          legislation being considered in the House would undermine the
          Administration's efforts to address these issues on the eve of the late
          october summit meeting. This summit will provide an opportunity to work
          for concrete progress on issues of concern to the United States.
          Consideration of H.R. 2570 and related legislation only makes that task
          more difficult.
