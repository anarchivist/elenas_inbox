State of the Union Proposals


Crime and Drugs

Horne Drug Testing Kits.  The President should announce a new FDA
policy on horne drug testing kits -- now ready to be announced by
FDA -- that overturns a restrictive policy developed during the
Reagan and Bush Administrations, which kept these kits off the
market.   This new standard would give parents a potentially
useful tool to help raise their children in a drug
o
-free horne.
(Family category issue, too)

Parental Accountability.   The President should encourage more
states and localities to adopt Parental Accountability or
Responsibility laws, so that parents are held responsible for the
acts of their children.
At least 10 states passed parental responsibility laws in 1995
and six more in 1996, with additional municipal ordinances
expanding the coverage of such laws.   Some states have adopted or
expanded civil statutes holding parents financially responsible
for damage done to private or public property, the costs of
incarcerating their child in a secure facility, and a growing
number of states -- including Arkansas -- permit the court to
order the parent"s to participate in community service, parenting
classes, and attend the juvenile court hearings.

Shaming Sentences.   The President should encourage more states
and localities to support Shaming Sentences for minor offenses --
so that juveniles offenders are forced to apologize in public and


adults are morally condemned    through public identification of
their non
o
-violent acts.
The President should announce his continuing commitment to
truth
o
-in
o
-sentencing for violent crimes and then pivot into his
support for alternative sentencing when appropriate, such as
shaming sentences, which instill the values of a community and
deter illegal activity.

New Law Enforcement Technology. The President should announce
that his Administration is ushering in a new age in police
technology that will not only help prevent crime but also make
policing safer.

Through this Administration's efforts, we are on the verge of a
"smart gun" that can only be fired by the actual gunowner;
advanced "concealed weapons technology" that will keep gun
o
-toting
criminals off our streets; "crime mapping" that will pinpoint
crime patterns and reduce crime like it did. in New York; and "gun
shot detection" which will help locate criminals.    ( .... and DNA
technology that will locate the "real killers!! !")


Families

Child Safety Seats.  The President should announce a new Federal
rule -- promulgated by NHSTA -- that will standardized child
safety seats for cars.
Presently, 80
o
-90% of parents with child safety seats are misusing
them, putting the child's life in danger.  This rule -- which DoT
is ready to announce during "Child Passenger Safety Week,
February 9th" -- will require a uniform attachment for child
safety seats that would ensure that the seat is properly
attached.  Parents should have the comfort that their child is
traveling safely.

No School, No Driver's License. The President should encourage
more states -- like Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia     to
require children to be in school in order to secure a driver's
license. Like his driver's license drug testing initiative,
minors should not be granted the privilege to drive a car unless
they earn it -- stay in school and drug
o
-free.
