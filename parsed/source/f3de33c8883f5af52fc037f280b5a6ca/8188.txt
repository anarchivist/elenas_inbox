 TEXT:
 FYI:  Per David Haun's note of last week, we received a draft of INS'
 proposed restructuring legislation on Wednesday, June 10. The Department
 of Justice told OMB that it wanted to clear the bill prior to any official
 OMB circulation and said it could clear the bill by Monday, June 15th. On
 Monday, the Department returned the bill to INS telling them that they
 needed to redraft the restructuring section of the bill -- telling INS
 that from the Department's perspective it did not pass the "laugh test."
 On Monday I also talked·with INS Legislative Affairs and suggested the
 restructuring section needed to be expanded along the lines Elena
 mentioned two weeks ago.  INS asked that I recommend some language.
 Attached is what I have informally submitted to INS this evening for
 consideration as they attempt to expand the restructuring section of the
 bill.

 I will talk with INS tomorrow in an effort to nail down a date when they
 plan to resubmit the bill to the Department for clearance.  Even an
 optimistic scenario, however, make clearance of the Administration's
 restructuring proposal prior to Senate Appropriations Subcommittee markup
 next Tuesday, highly unlikely.
