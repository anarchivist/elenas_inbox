TEXT:
We met today with representatives of the religious groups, AFL-CIO,
Department of Labor, and Senator Kerry's office.   The results were mixed:
general agreement on principle but dissagreement about a couple of
specific aspects of the bill. Bill Marshall thinks we are close enough to
say something general about it in the SOTU. Unless we really want it in,
I think it would be better to save it and hopefully get an announcement
 (with everything more explicit) and we can do an event where the religious
groups can, hopefully, stand with the President.
