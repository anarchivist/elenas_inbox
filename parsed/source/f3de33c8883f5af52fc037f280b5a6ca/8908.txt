TEXT:
I agree we need to reach out to HHS officials. Bill Hubbard says if Mary
Beth Donohue calls Friedman he'll tell her it is a good idea.  If you have
a good relationship with her (or Thurm) maybe you should call, otherwise I
will.   My list of other trouble spots: getting Glickman himself to
agree; reaching out to groups and getting them on board; fixing the
language of the EO.

Eric wanted to take another run at Glickman putting this as a pro-NAS
event (Glickman's first reaction when he heard this was to wait for the
NAS) .
