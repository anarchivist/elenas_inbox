Medicare and Abortion Coverage.       Recently, a provider sponsored organization (PSO), which is
a member of the Catholic Health Association (CHA), was informed by a Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) regional office that it could not participate in Medicare unless it agreed
to provide abortion services for Medicare beneficiaries. Although a little known fact, Medicare
does provide reimbursement for those limited occasions when a disabled Medicare beneficiary is
pregnant and seeks an abortion. The CHA requested that we attempt to find an exception for
PSOs that object to providing the service on religious/moral grounds.        Senator Nickles is also
placing great pressure on HHS to develop a formal position. Already he is reportedly drafting
legislation that would apply the Hyde Amendment to Medicare if we conclude that Hyde does
not have the statutory reach to apply to Medicare. (HHS initial review has concluded that Hyde
does not apply, but we are having White House lawyers review this analysis.) Even if Hyde
does not apply, we do believe we may have found a way to respbnd to CHA's request.
Specifically, PSOs that have "conscience clause" policies could be exempt from providing
abortion services; beneficiaries in these plans could go to a physician that billed Medicare directly
for the service. Unfortunately, Senator Nickles is not likely to accept this option, even if CHA
does. He clearly sees this as an extremely attractive election year issue. Ironically, however,
since the Hyde amendment has a rape or incest exception, our approach -- which would not
require that these PSOs reimburse for any abortion -- is more responsive to and consistent with
the CHA position. We have a working group from DPC, Council's office, OMB, and HHS
reviewing legal, policy and strategic options. We plan on sending you an options memo on this
issue shortly.

Genetic Discrimination Update.· Senator Jeffords, Chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, has indicated his intention to produce a bipartisan bill -- likely with
Senator Dodd -- that prohibits insurers from accessing and inappropriately utilizing
genetic coding information. Since last year, you have been calling on the Congress pass
legislation to bar both insurers and employers to use genetic information in a discriminatory
fashion. The Senator's announcement was as surprising as it is welcome; we will be sending
Administration witnesses to testify at the Labor Committee's hearing on this subject within the
next two weeks. While it will take work, we believe this Committee activity has every real
chance of making a significant contribution toward passing this bill either as a free standing
measure, a part of a patients bill of rights bill, or as part of a broader medical records/privacy
initiative. We will keep you apprised of developments.
