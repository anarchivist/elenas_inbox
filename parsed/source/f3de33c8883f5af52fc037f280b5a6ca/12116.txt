  FTC requires them to keep tapes for one year.    After the year is up, they
  reuse the same reel to reel tapes over again,   recording over all
  previously recorded material.

  They suggested I call the broadcast museum (312) 629-6024 who reported
  that they do not keep any copies of radio shows or transcripts.  They told
  me to call an air check company which records various radio shows for
  purchase.

  They gave me the following contacts:

  Windy City Air Checks
  708-474-0926

  National Air Checks
  708-916-1780

  Man from Mars Air Checks
  603- 668-0652.

  National Air Check appears not to be in existence. My contact at Man From
  Mars had never heard of it and the number does not work.

  Windy City Air Checks was a one-man operation, and he passed away in
  December so the company is closing.  Either his family will donate the
  tapes to charity or sell the business.

  Man from Mars is also a one man operation. The owner only records music
  programs. He does not record news programs and is not aware of anyone who
  does. He told me to call Carol Nashe from the NARTSH, the National
  Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts, which has recently disbanded.   She
  told me that she is not familiar with any company who records talk show
  programs, but she did have one phone call today from a company who is
  interested in getting started.  She told me that there is basically no way
  to get a hold of a talk show tape from six years ago.

  The Mara Tapp show has been off the air for 3 years and Dave McGuire , the
  head of radio archives says he doubts he will be able to get a copy from
·
     this show. He has told me that he will check and get back to me.   I have
     placed several calls back to him and I am waiting for his report.  If he
     does not have it, then like the previous situation we will not be able to
     get a copy of it.
