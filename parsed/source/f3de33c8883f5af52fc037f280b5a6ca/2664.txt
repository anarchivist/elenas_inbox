TEXT:
Attached is a draft POTUS decision memo for your review.  I will send you
an OSTP-reviewed updated draft tomorrow morning so you may not want to
read this draft.

HHS and USDA have cleared language OSTP and I proposed for the G-8
commuique, so we're in good shape on that.   will get it to NEC and let
them know we will give them the final go ahead once POTUS has responded to
our memo.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                         Elena Kagan
                              Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:                      Cloning Policy Options

Two upcoming events create the need to develop a position on legislation banning the cloning of
human beings. First, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) is about to
complete the review you requested of the ethical and legal issues associated with cloning human
beings. On Saturday, June 7, at its final public meeting, NBAC is expected to vote in favor of a
legislative ban. Second, France has proposed that the Denver Summit communique include a
paragraph urging countries to pass domestic legislative bans, and to work together toward a
global ban.

We recommend: (1) that you support domestic legislation banning human cloning, and that you
announce specific legislation at the top of your June 10th press conference; and (2) that the U.S.
support France's proposed cloning paragraph while insisting on critical modifications.

DISCUSSION

NBAC's Findings and Recommendations

In its draft final report, NBAC unanimously concludes that "it is morally unacceptable for
anyone ... to attempt to create a child" using the technology that created Dolly the sheep --
that is, the transfer of the nucleus from an adult somatic (non egg or sperm) cell into an
enucleated egg. NBAC bases this conclusion on safety concerns, finding that the technology is
"likely to involve substantial risk to the potential child." The report also states that "serious
ethical concerns ... require a great deal more widespread and careful thought and public
deliberation before this technology should be used."

The Commission notes that current restrictions effectively prohibit federally funded and
regulated entities from attempting to clone a human being through somatic cell nuclear transfer.
However, fertility clinics and other privately-funded clinical and research establishments face no
prohibition on human cloning. NBAC expresses doubt in certain organizations' willingness to
adhere to a voluntary moratorium.

NBAC clarifies that some forms of "human cloning" -- such as the cloning of DNA sequences,
cell lines, and tissues -- are scientifically important and not ethically problematic. Moreover,
NBAC finds that nuclear transfer cloning in animals is ethically acceptable and promises
                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
activities.
Accordingly, NBAC calls for carefully-worded national legislation prohibiting anyone from
"attempting to create a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques." The
Commission specifies that the legislation should include a sunset provision and that, prior to the
sunset date, an oversight body should review and report on the status of somatic cell nuclear
transfer technology and the ethical and social issues associated with its use in humans. NBAC
also recommends that the U.S. cooperate with other countries to enforce mutually-supported
cloning restrictions.


National Legislation

We recommend that you embrace NBAC's proposal to establish a narrowly crafted time-limited
legislative moratorium. Legislation is the only way to establish a comprehensive, enforceable
prohibition on cloning entire human beings in all research and clinical settings. If carefully
written, it will not preclude important research.

Reaction to proposed legislation should be primarily favorable. A national and international
consensus is emerging that attempting to apply the technology used to clone Dolly to humans is
morally wrong. The American Medical Association has conveyed this view to NBAC, and the
World Medical Association has issued a similar statement. Given NBAC's recommendation,
we expect many in the scientific and ethics communities to support a legislative moratorium.

But some who agree that cloning a human being using nuclear somatic cell transfer is morally
unacceptable will oppose a legislated moratorium. In particular, the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries strongly oppose legislation. These two industries are deeply
concerned that a legislative debate will produce broadly drawn language that impairs critical
research. Some academic researchers may share this view. Fertility clinics may also oppose
legislation, but to date have not signaled a position. Finally, some in the right-to-life community
will argue that NBAC's proposed approach will not fully protect embryos.

We recommend that you announce your support for legislation and propose specific legislative
language on June 10, at your scheduled press conference, three days after NBAC's
recommendation will become public. By acting quickly you can maintain your leadership on the
issue and carefully frame the legislative debate. As a practical matter, the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industry associations understand you may choose to take this approach and,
notwithstanding their opposition to a bill, have quietly advised us on legislative language.

Group of Eight Statement on Cloning


France has proposed the following paragraph for inclusion in the G-8 communique:
       could open the way to reproductive human cloning. We agree that the
       prohibition of any form of reproductive human cloning needs both strict domestic
       legislation and close international cooperation to adapt current international law.
        We are encouraged by the reflections underway within national ethics committees
       as well as in various regional and international fora. We are determined to give a
       strong impetus to their work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a
       universal ban on reproductive human cloning.

Gennany will support the statement; Canada will support it with some modification.

U.S. biotechnology and phannaceutical industries strongly oppose including any paragraph on
cloning in the communique. They fear that it will not be carefully drafted and may inadvertently
extend to the cloning of genes and cells as well as entire human beings. Further, industry is
concerned a statement on cloning could ultimately provide cover for protectionist efforts to
restrict U.S. biotechnology products and activities.

Nevertheless, we recommend that the Administration support the french proposal with critical
modifications. Specifically, we suggest that the U.S. insist on changes to: (1) affinn the
potential medical and agricultural benefits of cloning technology; (2) limit the prohibition to "the
use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to create a child;" and (3) propose a time-limited
moratorium instead of a ban. USDA and HHS support this position.
