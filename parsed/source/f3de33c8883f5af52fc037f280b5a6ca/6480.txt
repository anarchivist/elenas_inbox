TEXT:
Drunk Driving Event -- On Tuesday, you are scheduled for an event in the
Rose Garden to highlight setting a nationwide standard for drinking and
driving. You will calIon Congress to enact an amendment to ISTEA
legislation to make .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) the nationwide illegal
limit for drivers age 21 and older.  The amendment, which will be offered
by Senators Lautenberg and DeWine, gives states three years to adopt .08
BAC limits, or risk losing highway construction funds.'  To date, 15
states have adopted .08 BAC laws.   We are also preparing a directive
which would require the Secretary of Transportation to develop a plan to
promote the adoption of .08 BAC as the illegal per se limit on federal
property, such as national parks and military installations. [Note to
EK: You may want to delete this last sentence if you/BR do not want to go
forward with the directive.)
