TEXT:
There will be the first event meeting today at 3:30 pm in room 100 on the
First Lady's Wednesday morning event announcing a national effort to
prescribe reading to young children and ensure that children who come to
the doctor have access to books.  The POTUS will attend the event if the
budget negotiations don't stop him.

Please attend as appropriate.

John Funderburke is the scheduler for this event but is out of the office
until Monday.
