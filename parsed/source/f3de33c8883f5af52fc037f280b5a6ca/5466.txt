TALKING POINTS ON REPORT FROM
PRESIDENTD,S ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HIV/AIDS

The Clinton Administration continues its aggressive campaign against the
AIDS epidemic
Obtained substantial increases in AIDS funding (discretionary programs at
HHS up 60% since start of term)
Established the HIV vaccine Initiative, with goal of finding vaccine
against HIV within 10 years
Supported reauthorization and funding of Ryan White CARE Act - funding
nearly tripled since start of Administration
Supported research that resulted in the new treatments that are saving so


many lives - funding for AIDS research at NIH increased 50% since start of
Administration
Increased specific Federal funding for the State AIDS Drug Assistance
Program nearly 450% since 1996
Created and Supported the Office of National AIDS Policy
Protected Medicaid, which serves 50% of people with AIDS and 90% of
children with AIDS

Role of the PresidentO,s Advisory Council is to provide advice from the
community
We understand frustration of Council members - this is a terrible epidemic
that gives rise to strong emotions
If some members choose to resign, we respect but regret their decision -
however, it would be our hope that they will stay at the table and work
with the President to continue to make a difference
President and the Secretary will continue to work with the Council to
review their reports and to respond quickly and decisively

The appropriateness of needle exchange programs should be determined by
public health experts and scientists, not politicians
Administration worked aggressively to preserve the SecretaryO,s authority
to make determination on removing Congressionally imposed restriction on
allowing local communities to decide on the use of federal funding for
needle exchange programs
Authority should remain with the Secretary because she is the chief public
health officer of this country and with community public health experts --
this is an issue for public health experts to resolve
Congress agreed, sustaining the SecretaryO,s authority
Secretary is evaluating available scientific review,s of needle exchange
programs to determine appropriate course of action



Q & A
Meeting of and Report from the
PresidentO,s Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS
December, 1997



The PACHA accuses the Administration of having stalled on the AIDS
crisis. Is this true?
No.  President Clinton and his Administration remain fully engaged in the
effort to end this epidemic. We have supported substantial increases in
AIDS funding for care, prevention, and research, even at a time when
overall discretionary funding has been tight.

Our accomplishments are remarkable.  Investments in AIDS research have
resulted in powerful new treatments that have helped reduce the numbers of
AIDS deaths for the first time since the start of the epidemic. The Ryan
White program, now funded at over a billion dollars, has allowed for a
broad array of primary care and supportive services that is unparalleled.
We have established a major initiative to find a vaccine against HIV
within ten years.

The PACHA is expressing understandable frustration with a devastating
epidemic. Presidential advisory councils are not intended to serve as
D&rubber stamps;08 on the contrary, they are intended to provide
independent, objective advice to the Administration. No doubt they are
using this public document as a means to continue their advocacy with this


Administration.

What do you say to the PACHA members who are threatening to resign if   the
Administration does not approve needle exchange programs?
We certainly understand the frustration of some of members of the
PresidentD, s Advisory Council on HIV IAIDS (·PACHAl. While their
participation in the PACHA process is the most effective way for them   to
work with the Administration, they certainly have the right to choose   to
remove themselves. Unfortunately, that means that they will not have    a
voice at the table.

This Administration is very concerned about the continued spread of this
epidemic, and is seriously reviewing the impact of needle exchange
programs on curtailing HIV transmission among injection drug abusers. We
worked diligently with the Congress to maintain the authority of the
Secretary of Health and Human Services to remove the current restriction
on the use of federal funds by local communities that choose to implement
needle exchange programs. We did this because we believe that this is an
issue best left to the public health experts and not to the politicians.

Is the President going to allow funding for needle exchange programs?
The decision to lift the Congressionally imposed restriction on the use of
federal funds for needle exchange programs has been vested by Congress
with the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  She has not yet made
that determination because she is studying the benefit of those programs
in reducing HIV transmission and their impact on the use of illegal
drugs. This is not the simple and obvious decision as has been
characterized by AIDS activists. On the contrary, this nation has an
epidemic of illegal drug use and we do not want to support something to
address AIDS that will undermine our efforts on the drug epidemic. The
President will continue to support the SecretaryD,s process, and respects
her ability to make a decision on needle exchange that is grounded in
science and public health.

The PACHA is debating HIV names reporting? What is that and what is the
AdministrationD,s position?
Many AIDS advocates, epidemiologists, and government officials now believe
that our efforts to fight the AIDS epidemic would be improved with better
information on the incidence of HIV infection. We currently rely
primarily on the numbers of AIDS diagnoses or deaths as a measure of where
this epidemic is currently and where it seems to be moving.  However,
because more and more people are living longer and longer with HIV and not
progressing to AIDS, this data is increasingly out of pace with the front
edge of the epidemic. This reduces our ability to initiate the kind of
proactive prevention efforts necessary to stem the tide of new
infections.

However, we are also very mindful of the very real concerns around
confidentiality. The fear of disclosure of a positive HIV test result may
inhibit many from getting tested, which is the first step in accessing
medical care and avoiding further transmission.  The Administration will
continue to work with government and community experts to determine the
best way to balance the need for more timely information on new infections
with the imperative to promote HIV testing and access to care for those
infected.
