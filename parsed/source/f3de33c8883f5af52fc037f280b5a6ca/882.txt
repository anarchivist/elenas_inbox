    Here it is at last.

    To be safe, I have asked OMB staff to take a quick look at it since they
    have a better technical grasp of this than I do, but we needn't wait for
    them if you want to ship this to the VP asap.

    You might take a look at the collective bargaining/NLRB description, which
    is where I feel least certain.

                           Background on Labor Issues in Welfare Reform

    Minimum Wage and Other Labor Protections
    As states begin to put welfare recipients to work, a key question for the labor movement and for
    the states is whether welfare recipients who take part in workfare or subsidized employment
    programs are protected by labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. The most obvious
    protection this law offers is payment of the minimum wage, but there are a host of other
    protections (and costs to employers) that are connected: collective bargaining rights, taxation,
    un~mployment insurance, and workers' compensation.


    We are in general agreement that these workers should be paid the minimum wage, but two
    major issues remain:

    ·      What streams of benefits should count toward the minimum wage?

    ·      Have we thought through the consequences of other rights and costs that appear to come
           along with the minimum wage, and how they would affect the success of welfare reform?

    The Department of Labor and HHS believe that, as a legal matter, it is quite clear that the Fair
    Labor Standards Act does apply to people in workfare and wage supplementation programs --
    that essentially they are employees, with limited exceptions for "trainees." Labor and HHS
    argue that this is not really a change in Federal policy, since they would argue that these rules
    have always applied to welfare waiver programs. However, the scale of the coming
    welfare-to-work effort is so much larger than the waivers that these requirements may still come
    as a shock to the states, and will raise affordability questions that didn't exist in those smaller
    programs. Also, the focus on enforcement of these laws will inevitably be much greater now
    than in the past.

    Minimum Wage: One problem in requiring the minimum wage is that the existing welfare grant
    in many states is too low to convert it into a minimum wage salary, even ifthe recipient is only
    working 20 or 25 hours a week. Therefore, the question is whether to include in that calculation
    a variety of other government benefits, such as food stamps, child care, housing assistance, and
    transportation.

    Legally, there is a strong argument that food stamps can be added to the basic welfare grant to
    help support a minimum wage. However, even if the two grants are combined, several Southern
    states will probably still come up short, especially for smaller families. The problem gets worse
    as the minimum wage and the work requirements increase over time.

    We would make it easier for states if we permitted them to count the value of other benefits, like
    child care or transportation, toward the minimum wage. However, DOL believes the law does
    not permit this, unless those benefits are offered to all employees, not only those on welfare.
    States may be motivated to segregate workfare recipients in an effort to get around this
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

requirement.
Other Labor Protections: We are still in the process of sorting out what other requirements states
and employers would face if participants in workfare and subsidized employment programs are
considered employees under labor law. DOL's opinion is that most other standard labor
protections would apply,incIuding OSHA, unemployment insurance, and anti-discrimination
laws.

The thorniest outstanding questions have to do with taxes and collective bargaining rights. We
have yet to hear from Treasury as to whether wages would be subject to FICA and other taxes, as
well as eligible for the EITC. On collective bargaining, the National Labor Relations Board will
have to rule on the facts in individual situations, but it is likely they would rule that these workers
are eligible to unionize. There has been some recent media attention on efforts to unionize
workfare recipients in New York City, and there certainly would be more attention if the ruling
were made that these workers had the right to unionize.

We are working to resolve these issues in the next week or two. In addition, we are thinking
through our strategy on the Hill, given the likelihood of a backlash there once these
interpretations are known.

Privatization
A second issue concerns efforts by some states to privatize their welfare operations. Texas has
had a request pending at USDA and HHS for months that would privatize eligibility
determinations for food stamps and Medicaid. Wisconsin has a similar waiver request pending.
Current law requires these programs to use "merit systems" employees -- essentially government
workers. However, it appears we can waive this requirement if we want to. This is a major
issue for unions with a large number of public sector employees (AFSCME and SEIU) since it
would lead to a direct loss of membership. Our analysis is not as far along here. The unions
are not pressing us for a decision, since they fear we will not rule entirely in their favor.
However, we can expect increasing pressure from Govs. Bush and Thompson ..
