On Friday, 2/14 from 3pm to 4pm in 472 OEOB we will have a meeting to discuss
alternative spending cap plans for campaign finance reform.   We will review
and discuss several alternative spending cap plans that do not include
aggregate spending caps as currently envisioned in McCain-Feingold and
Shays-Meehan. Data on these alternative pl'ans, and how they would have
impacted last fall's Senate races, will be distributed on Thursday. Hope you
can attend.
