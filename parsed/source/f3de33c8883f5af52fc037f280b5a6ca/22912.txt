TEXT:
Tomorrow the HHS IS will release a report on teen cigar use based on 18
focus groups of 227 junior high, high school, and college students. The
HHS IG is giving a copy to the WSJ today something neither we nor HHS can
prevent (Melissa is just happy she got it delayed as long as she has) .
The IG has let HHS edit and tone down the draft paper which I will fax
you.  In summary it says:

Today HHS IG issue reports warning about cigar use among teenagers and
recommending mandatory warning labels similar to those on cigarettes and
other tobacco products.

The report found a third of teen admitted having smoked a cigar in the
last 30 days and half. expected to be a cigar user five years in the
future.  An earlier CDC survey had found 28 percent of teens smoked
cigars, while the SAMSHA survey found 5 percent did.

Fifty four percent of teens had smoked a cigar sometime in their life and
of that number two thirds had done so in the past year.  Of the 82 teens
that had smoked a cigar in the past year, 60 percent also reported smoking
cigarettes.  Forty percent said teen smoking is growing among their peers.

Although the sale of cigars to minors is illegal in all 50 states, the IG
says state level enforcement is uneven and is given a lower priority than
unlawful cigarette and spit tobacco sales.

The report also notes the growing phenomenon of "blunting" cigars for
marijuana consumption (hollowing them out and replacing the tobacco with
marijuana)

In the Q&A HHS wants to say they support the same sort of warning label on
cigars that are required on other tobacco because "there's no safe form of
tobacco."  (The Surgeon General already endorsed this about a year ago.)
As you know FTC not HHS has jurisdiction over warning labels.   FTC
apparently could do so under current authority but would prefer to have
statutory diection.  I've just res canned the McCain bill, which included
stronger labels on cigarettes and smokess but did not add labels to cigars.




The Q&A also notes that the FDA rule 1996 rule did not include cigars
because FDA did not have sufficient evidence to show that cigars are
addictive and could be classified as drugs or devices.

It also mistakenly says our excise tax doesn't apply to cigars (we'll fix
that - our 55 cent tax will apply (at an equivalent level) to cigars as
well as other tobacco products)

Shalala will be with the vp tomorrow at a domestic violence event and will
be happy to handle Qs if they come up.  I'll get you guys the draft paper
and revised when it's done.
