PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
RADIO ADDRESS ON FOOD DISASTERS
April 18, 1998


        Good morning.  This week, Americans are coming together to help
people who have lost their homes in the devastating tornadoes that have
swept across the South. They are gathering together clothing, bedding,
and canned goods to help the victims of these terrible storms to rebuild
their lives.

        Today, I want to caution all Americans to exercise care when
selecting canned products to donate -- especially imported canned fruit
Ju~ce.  Many of these products were produced under sanitary conditions
that do not meet our own high standards. Others are tinned in cans with
lead seals that can leach into the juice and harm our children.

        Our administration has tried repeatedly to make the countries that
produce these unsafe juices improve their safety standards, but our pleas
have fallen on deaf ears.  We have even threatened not to trade with these
countries -- all to no avail.   And don't forget: American juice means
more than American safety standards.  It means American jobs.

        So please, before you toss that dented can of slightly fermented
guava juice into the storm relief box, remember our children, remember our
workers, and remember America.

           Thanks for listening.

   Jose suggested I send you our proposed list of speakers for the crime
   event, but we have not actually reached out to anyone yet.  I can be
   reached through Signal, and will be able to work on the speaking program
   and what each speaker will say from my vacation tomorrow.

   Program:
   1. Boston Mayor Menino
   (to talk about Boston's success w/ community policing - and possibly
   announce new crime stats that show a continued decline in crime.)

   2. Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans
   (to reinforce the importance of the COPS program and praise the
   President's commitment to law enforcement. Massachusetts will be
   receiving many grants being announced at this event.)

   3. Police Corps Graduate from Maryland who enlisted in the program b/c of
   his brother's gang-related death.
   (Massachusetts will be receiving Police Corps grants to create a program.
   Maryland already has a good program and will be receiving funding in this
   wave of grants for their existing program.)

   4. To introduce the President, either:
   Citizen involved in community watch activities with the Police Department,
   who became active because of a personal experience, and/or

   School Resource Officer who can talk about the importance of COPS in
   schools, and who hopefully was able to stop a student crime by being on a
   school campus.

   Sites:
   An advance lead will be arriving in Boston tomorrow and will begin looking
   at possible sites.  The Mayor recommended going to the Hyde Park Municipal
   Building where there is square similar to Lafayette park where we could do
   an outdoor event.  This is in Joe Moakley's CD.   (We will need to stay out
   of the 8th CD b/c there are 10 Democratic candidates running for Joe
   Kennedy's seat in this district.) The scheduling office knows this and
'.

they will be looking at the Hyde Park square and some boys and girls clubs
tomorrow.
