                                Education Q&A
                               February 16, 1999


Q:   USA Today, AP, and the Washington Post are reporting that the
     Administration will call for a uniform licensing system for teachers. What is
     this idea? Is the Administration proposing a new national teaching license
     or teaching test?

A:   Yesterday, Secretary Riley gave his annual State of American Education
     Address today, which he uses to assess the state of education and to raise
     ideas and spark long-term discussions among academics, educators and
     others. Since improving the quality of teachers is an important piece of the
     president's education agenda, Secretary Riley's speech included some ideas
     to spark a discussion among states and communities as they consider ways to
     license and certify teachers. Secretary Riley encouraged states and
     communities to develop these and other ideas on licensing and certifying
     teachers as they work on this issue over the next few years. But he did not
     call for any type of national teaching license, he did not call for national
     standards or tests for teachers, and he is not calling for states to adopt any
     single idea or proposal. Riley is a former Governor and strongly supports
     state and local responsibility in the areas of teacher licensure and
     certification.

     In his speech, Secretary Riley also called for more immediate actions to move
     forward on the President's agenda to improve education. Riley called for
     enactment of the president's education accountability act to end social
     promotion and strengthen accountability in our public schools. And he
     called on Congress to enact the President's proposals to modernize school
     buildings and build on last year's down payment on hiring 100,000 teachers
     to reduce class size.

Q:   Will the Administration include this in its proposal to reauthorize the
     Elementary and Secondary Education Act? When the Administration is
     proposing requirements that states take such steps as ending social
     promotion, intervening in failing schools, etc. why not require these ideas as
     well?

A:   In his State of the Union Address, the President proposed steps to end social
     promotion, fix failing schools, and other steps to strengthen accountability in
     our schools. These ideas are based on considerable experience at the state
     and local level and reflect broad consensus across the nation. The ideas on
     teacher licensure and certification outlined by Secretary Riley reflect neither
     such extensive experience at the state and local, nor such consensus. Neither
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


Secretary Riley nor anyone here believes these ideas should be the basis of
any legislative proposals. Riley simply is making a first attempt to
jumpstart an important dialogue on these issues among academics,
educators, states, and communities across the nation as they work on these
issues over the next few years.
