TEXT:
FYI -- Today Ellen Vargyas called to say that DOJ sent them a letter
stating that they are sending to OLC the issue of whether EEOC has the
authority to permit administrative judges, rather than the agencies
themselves, to issue final decisions in federal sector discrimination
cases.  Sally Katzen had specifically brokered a deal with the agencies
not to send this issue to OLC. However, DOJ was not at the meeting where
the deal was brokered. This is unusual because DOJ merely sent the letter
in and did not call first to discuss their concerns. Sally has put in a
call to Don Arbuckle to get him to call DOJ to find out what's going on.
I will keep you updated.  Mary
