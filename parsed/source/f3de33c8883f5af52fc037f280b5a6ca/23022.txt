TEXT:
The Senate Supplemental includes $350 million in TANF cuts.   Even the
House Republicans haven't included it -- more eager, I take it, to keep
their deal with the governors. As you know the Administration is opposing
all offsets (since the rules don't require emergency spending to be
offset) which of course includes these.

I'm concerned that OMB's opposition to these cuts is not very strong.  In
my conversations with Barbara Chow she had said of course they oppose them
but cannot predict where things will end up come September.  I think this
is ludicrous -- we should vigorously oppose these cuts throughout the
year.

I think it might be helpful if sent a joint DPC-OMB memo to the President
on this topic. We will soon have updated figures to provide the rationale
for such a memo. What do you think?
