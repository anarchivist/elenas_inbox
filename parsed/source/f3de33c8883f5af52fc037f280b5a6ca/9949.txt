Now that you have all picked up the new digital Sprint phones, I am going
to need the old, crappy, analog phones back as we can assign them to other
personnel.  Please make sure to return all of the equipment, including
charger, extra batteries (if applicable), leather cases, and any
instructions about the use of the phones.

Thanks!
