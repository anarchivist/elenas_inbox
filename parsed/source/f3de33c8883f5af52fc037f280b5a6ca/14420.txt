           You should be getting a package from me w/SSA's draft notice to
           legal immigrants losing SSI, which SSA sent over for us to look
           at. Brian Coyne said he needs our comments by the end of the
           week, so you should get comments to Steve or me by that time.

TEXT:
You should have received a copy of the HHS proposed "final" draft bill
that would make technical amendments to the welfare reform law (P.L.
104-193) [see LRM MDH-1] .  Note that HHS has included in its package a
   ·
new provision regarding the treatment of certain Amerasian immigrants as
refugees (see page 64 ).

 HHS has asked that OMB provide it with clearance to transmit its draft
bill to Congress by Tuesday, December 10th. For this reason, comments are
due to me by noon tomorrow (Tuesday). Thank you.
