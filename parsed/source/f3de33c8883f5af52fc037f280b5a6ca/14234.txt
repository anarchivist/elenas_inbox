TEXT:

Diane Blackmun called to say that the meeting this afternoon has
to be cancelled.  I do not know what is going on, but I infer that
SSA may view our meeting to try to understand what the POMS means
as unwelcome. This is based upon Diane saying that we would hear
from people "higher" than her about this.
If anyone had any opportunity to glance at the POMS you will note,
e.g. that it provides a preliminary definition of "means-tested
programs" and instructs field workers how to verify eligible
veterans, 40 quarters, etc. under the new law.  I still don't
understand how SSA attends meetings where these issues are being
discussed and fails to flag the issue that an SSA operational
manual that it has plans to distribute imminently has resolved
these issues. They may very well have solved all of the issues
and that would be great, but I don't know what they think all of
these other meetings and attempts to figure out how to comply with
the new law are about.
