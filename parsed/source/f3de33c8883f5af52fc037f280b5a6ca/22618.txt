                                     Questions and Answers
                                        February 6, 1999


    Q:   If there are over 4,000 gun shows each year, and only 314 ATF investigations, are
         you overstating the gun show problem?

    A:   No, we are not. Today's report makes a very strong case that gun shows have provided a
         forum for illegal gun sales and firearms trafficking. The 314 gun show investigations
         reviewed in the report involved tens of thousands of firearms and led to very serious
         crimes, including homicide. Specifically, in just these 314 cases, we uncovered:

                - more than 54,000 firearms of all sorts, with the largest case involving up to
                10,000 firearms and a third of the cases involving at least 50 guns each;

                - felons buying and selling firearms;

                - guns bought and sold at gun shows being used in serious crimes;

                - persons selling firearms without a license;

                - gun dealers selling firearms "off the books" -- that is, without conducting a
                background check or keeping a record; and

                - the transfer offireanns to juveniles, felons and other persons prohibited by law
                from buying a gun.


    Q:   Doesn't the report essentially recommend regulating every private and secondary
         sale of a firearm?

    A:   No, it does not. The report does recommend defining gun shows broadly and including
         any place -- such as a flea market -- where 50 or more guns are sold by at least 2 people,
         and this will cover many previously unregulated gun sales. But the report does not put
         any restrictions on the private sale of individual firearms by unlicensed persons, though it
         encourages these gun owners about their responsibilities under the law.


    Q:   Instead of new legislation, why doesn't the Administration simply enforce existing
         laws more effectively?

    A:   Although we intend to enforce existing laws more vigorously, and the President's FY
         2000 budget includes nearly $30 million in new funds for that purpose, current federal
         law only regulates federally licensed gun dealers (FFLs). Non-licensees and private
                         Hex·Dump Conversion

      collectors -- who are not formally engaged in the business of selling firearms -- are
      generally allowed to transfer firearms at a gun show without conducting a background
      check or keeping records. The legislative recommendations presented in today's report
      will close this loophole.


Q:    Isn't this really a problem for the States? What are the States doing about gun
      shows?

A:    Gun shows are a problem for the federal government and the states. More than half of
      the states impose no prohibition whatsoever on the private transfer of firearms among
      unlicensed persons and do not regulate the operation of gun shows. Other states only
      impose restrictions on the private sales or transfers of firearms similar to the federal law,
      such as prohibiting the transfer of firearms to felons, juveniles, the mentally disturbed,
      etc. Thus, today's recommendations will make a big difference in the many areas where
      there are currently almost no restrictions on the sale of firearms at gun shows.


BradylNICS

Q:    How many Brady background checks have been performed since the National
      Instant Criminal Background System (NICS) took effect on November 30, 1998?

 A:   Since its implementation on November 30, 1998, the NICS has handled over 1.5 million
      Brady background checks. Of these, about 790,000 of these were handled by the FBI
      and resulted in the denial of over 16,200 illegal gun sales to felons, fugitives, and other
      prohibited purchasers. The remaining 700,000 were processed by states that have agreed
      to serve as NICS points-of-contact. We do not, at this time, have information on the
      number of denials at the state level.

                     President Clinton: Closing the Loophole on Gun Shows
                                        February 6, 1999

Today, President Clinton will release a report from Treasury Secretary Rubin and Attorney General
Reno, recommending actions the Administration can take to ensure that firearms sold at gun shows are
not exempt from federal firearms laws. The President will accept their recommendations and also
announce an increase of nearly $30 million in his FY 2000 budget to enhance firearms enforcement
and prosecutions for gun law violations, including those committed at gun shows.

Findings of the Report. In response to a directive by the President last November, the Treasury and
Justice Departments reviewed 314 gun show-related investigations involving more than 54,000
firearms, and spanning a wide range of federal firearms violations. Their review found the following:

       Number of gun shows. In 1998, there were an estimated 4,442 gun shows. Most gun shows
       were sponsored by state and local firearms collectors organizations, though some shows were
       promoted by individual collectors and business people. Ten states sponsored gun shows the
       most frequently: TX (472); PA (250); FL (224); IL (203); CA (188); IN (180); NC (170); OR
       (160); OH (148); and NV (129).

       Typical gun show. The typical gun show costs about $5 to attend and draws an average of
       between 2,500 and 5,000 people. Vendors rent tables for a fee ranging from $5 to $50, and the
       number of tables varies from as few as 50 to as many as 2,000. Federally-licensed firearms
       dealers (FFLs) make up about 50 to 75 percent of these vendors, with unlicensed gun sellers
       representing the remaining 25 to 50 percent. Unlicensed gun sellers -- who are assumed to be
       selling from their personal collections -- are not required to conduct background checks or keep
       records of gun sales. Large quantities of firearms are also sold in less formal and smaller
       public markets, such as flea markets.

       Guns sold. The types and variety of firearms sold at gun shows include both new and used
       handguns, semiautomatic assault weapons, shotguns, rifles, and curio and relic firearms (novel
       and older firearms). Additionally, vendors often sell large capacity magazines, machine gun
       parts, and a wide variety of other paraphernalia (knives, ammunition, military artifacts, books).

       Forum for illegal sales and trafficking. The review makes clear that gun shows provide a
       forum for illegal firearms sales and gun trafficking. Felons buying and selling firearms were
       involved in more than 46 percent of the 314 gun show investigations reviewed, and in more
       than a third of these investigations the firearms involved were subsequently used in serious
       crimes, including homicides. Other gun law violations observed at gun shows included:
       selling firearms without a federal gun license (more than 50 percent of the cases reviewed);
       dealers selling firearms "otfthe books" -- or without conducting a background check or
       keeping a record (about 20 percent of cases); selling guns to prohibited purchasers, such as
       felons or juveniles (15 percent of the cases); and violations of the federal ban on the sale and
       transfer of machine guns (20 percent of cases). Finally, more than a third of the investigations
       involved more than 50 firearms, and at least one investigation involved up to 10,000 firearms.

     The Report's Recommendations. To close the gun show loophole that allows countless firearms
                  to be sold on a "no questions asked" basis, the President will endorse all of the
                  report's recommendations and support legislation, to be introduced by Senator
                  Frank Lautenberg and Representative Rod Blagojev:ich, that will make them the law
                  of the land_ These recommendations include:

            (1) Defining gun shows to include not only specialized gun events, but flea markets and
            other markets outside of licensed firearms shops at which 50 or more fireanns are offered
            for sale by 2 or more persons;

            (2) Requiring gun show promoters to register and notify the Bureau of Alcohol,
            Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) of all gun shows;

            (3) Requiring Brady background checks on all fireanns transferred at gun shows, with
            the assistance of federally-licensed dealers;

            (4) Reporting information on firearms sold -- such as manufacturer, model, and serial
            number -- to ATF's National Tracing Center, so that guns sold at gun shows cannot
            disappear without a trace;

            (5) Reviewing the law's definition of what it means to be "engaged in the business," so
            that we can better identify and prosecute illegal gun traffickers;

            (6) Increasing resources to combat the illegal trade of firearms at gun shows; and

            (7) Educating gun owners about their responsibilities under the law, so that when they
            sell or dispose of firearms they do not fall into the wrong hands_

     New Resources for Firearms Enforcement. Consistent with the report's findings and
     recommendations, the President's FY 2000 budget includes over $28 million in new funds to
     enhance the enforcement of federal firearms laws, including:

            $12.6 million for more than 100 new ATF agents to support investigations at gun shows,
            arrest violent criminals and gun traffickers, and crack down on illegal gun sales;

            $5 million for more than 40 additional federal prosecutors to conduct intensive firearms
            prosecution projects targeting violent felons who possess guns, armed drug traffickers, and
            illegal gun markets; and

            $11.2 million to expand the number oflocallaw enforcement agencies engaged in
            comprehensive gun tracing through the President's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative_
