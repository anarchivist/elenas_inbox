TEXT:
Note that this means the Hutchison bill has no cost, no matter what bill,
if any, it's attached to, because the GOP budget committee has directed
CBO to change its baseline assumptions.

The bill always cost zero on appropriations (since the original score had
no first year cost) but now the bill will cost zero in other contexts
where a five year score matters.

Subject: Recoupment Removed from Budget Resolution Baseline

CBO's February 1999 baseline assumes Federal Medicaid recoveries of $2.9
billion as a result of State third-party liability collections from
settlements with the tobacco industry.

For the purposes of determinations and points of order, however, Sec. 312
of the Congressional Budget Act places the authority for developing
estimates of direct spending with the Budget Committees.

Under this authority, the Budget Committees, through the budget resolution
conference report, adjusted the CBO Medicaid baseline to remove Federal
recoveries of State tobacco settlement funds from the baselines.
(According to the Senate Committee report , which was adopted in the
conference:  "The SBC baseline is the same as the CBO February baseline
for direct spending programs, except that the SBC baseline assumes the
Federal government will not recover any amounts from the states'
settlement with the tobacco industry.")

For Congressional scoring purposes, Sen. Hutchinson's amendment to
relinquish Federal authority in Medicaid to recoup tobacco settlement
funds would therefore have no costs.   (By comparison, relative to the CBO
baseline, the amendment would cost $2.9 billion.)   Since the OMB baseline
does not assume any recoupment at this point, the amendment would also
have no costs by our scoring.
