TEXT:
FYI. Yesterday, the Senate voted 68 to 31 in favor of the Smi-th/Wyden H2A
amendment.  However, two secondary amendments were included:   (1) a
Feinstein amendment that permits the Secretary of Labor to limit the
number of H2A visas issued; and (2) a Kennedy amendment that provides that
the President, in implementing this title, shall not implement any
provision that he deems to be in violation of any of the following
principles (then attached the DOL list of principles). Also, the
provision for a user fee was struck (this fee was to go into a fund to pay
for the registry) .

Also, Feinstein's office called the DOL late yesterday. They stated that
Bob Graham wants to work on compromise legislation and asked to meet with
DOL and the CA growers to try to work something out. Labor asked why a
farmworker advocate was not also included in the mix.   Feinstein's staff
stated that she thought that the DOL was that advocate.  DOL explained
that the farmworkers don't see it that way, and that it would be best to
have someone from that side also at the table.
