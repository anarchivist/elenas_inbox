TEXT:
Jim Dorskind wanted me to run the following edit to the Securites Lit form
letter by you.  Can we say, "I encourage the Commission to recommend amendments"
or is it improper for the President to encourage the SEC to do anything?
Here's the entire paragraph:
I also believe it will be useful for the Commission to advise me and the
Congress about the impact of the Act on the effectiveness of the securities laws
and on investor protection as well as on the extent and nature of any litigation
under the Act.  If there are indications that portions of the Act are negitively
affecting the integrity of our markets, I encourage the Commission to recommend
amendments.
Thanks,
Tracy
