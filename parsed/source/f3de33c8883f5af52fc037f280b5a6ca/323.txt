FYI,
As I think everyone knows, The Women's Office has an Oct. 1 date for a
Presidential event around Domestic violence.  They would like to announce the
Domestic violence Directive at that event.
I have talked with Joan Silverstein at DOJ and Ann Rosewater at HHS.   Both DOJ
and HHS support the decision to go with a Presidential Directive to the AG and
Sec. Shalala without any regulatory measure.
DOJ and HHS will fax me drafts of their portion of the directive tomorrow, we'll
combine them, iron out any differences, and pass it around for comment.
Obviously, Oct. 1 is approaching quickly, so we need to move fast.
Thanks!
