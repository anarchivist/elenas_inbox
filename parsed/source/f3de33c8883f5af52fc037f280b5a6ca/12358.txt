  'TEXT:
   Irene and I just attended a conference call with OMB, HHS-ASMB,
   HHS-ACF-Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to discuss the process
   both in terms of operation and funding -- of moving 20,000 Kosovo refugees
   to the US next month.  Lavinia Limon, ORR, outlined the following two
   options, and suggested that the likely outcome will be a mixture of both.
   There will be a conference call tomorrow (NSC, HHS, OMB) to further
   discuss Scenarios 1 and 2.

  Scenario1: Process refugees abroad

  Refugee processing (INS interviews, medical screening, etc)    is conducted
  overseas and State Oept picks up the costs.

  HHS estimates that of the 20,000 arriving refugees:
    -- 35% would be eligible for Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee
  Medical Assistance (RMA) , increasing program costs by $23.3 million in
  FY99, and $14.6 million in FYOO;
  -- 10% would be eligible for SSI/MA (no cost estimate available at this
  time) ;
  -- 55% would be eligible for TANF/MA (no cost estimate available at this
  time); and,
  -- all would be eligible for Food Stamps (no cost estimate available at
  this time).

  Scenario 2: Process refugees in the US

  When processing refugees in the US, the Refugee Act requires the Secy of


     HHS to operate a domestic processing center. DoD is exploring the use of
     military facilities as processing centers. HHS estimates that processing
     could take up to 6 months.  Under this scenario, HHS provided very rough
     cost estimates (as follows), but plans to meet with DoD folks on Monday to
     compare numbers.

     -- $20 million for placement, reception (OMB will see if State Dept can
     cover these     costs.)
        $10 million for ongoing transportation
     -- $15 million contractor staff, communications, orientation, recreation
     -- $23 million medical, dental, hospital
     TOTAL processing costs = $68 million for FY 99

     Since refugees would reside in camps for the remainder of FY 99, there
     would be no program costs until FY 00.  HHS estimates FYOO additional RCA
     and RMA costs of $38.7 million.

     Processing refugees in the US may require changes in the supp.  OMB is
     investigating.   ACF-ORR conveyed that the ORR could cover the FY 99 costs
     associated with this option. However, the FY 00 budget would leave them
     with a cushion of only $5 million.
