TO:                       Stephanie Streett

FROM:

REQUEST:                  For the President to host a White House event with the
                          bi-partisan Senate and House co-sponsors of the Hate
                          Crimes Prevention Act, on the occasion of its
                          re-introduction in Congress. The event to include
                          participation from and to highlight the increasingly broad
                          and bi-partisan support the legislation has in the law
                          enforcement and civil rights communities. MTV is
                          prepared to release a poll on the day of the event relating
                          to youth and hate crimes.

PURPOSE:                  To amplify the President's unity and reconciliation
                          themes and to demonstrate the Administration's
                          commitment to the legislation.

BACKGROUND:               The President announced his sponsorship and the
                          introduction of this legislation at the White House
                          Conference on Hate Crimes on November 10, 19997. The
                          legislation would strengthen the ability of the Justice
                          Department to prosecute hate crimes based on race and
                          religion by removing needless jurisdictional requirements
                          and give the Department the power to prosecute hate
                          crimes committed because of the victim's sexual orientation,
                          gender, or disability. A recent CNN/Gallup/USA Today
                          poll found that 70 of respondents favor hate crimes laws
                          and that 83 and 75 , respectively, favor coverage for
                          women and gays.
