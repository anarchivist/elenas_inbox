MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

FROM: Charles F.e. Ruff

SUBJECT: Further on Helms v. Picard

        After your review of our April 1 Memorandum to you on this case, in which the Fifth
Circuit held unconstitutional, as applied, a provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education
Act that permits local educational agencies to lend computers and other instructional materials
to private sectarian schools, we have continued our efforts to resolve the disagreement between
the Solicitor General and the Secretary of Education as to whether we should seek Supreme
Court review of that decision. In addition, the Secretary and the Solicitor General met with the
private school groups to discuss the best strategy for approaching the Supreme Court.. I am
pleased to report that the Solicitor General and the Secretary have reached agreement on the
following course of action, which we believe is consistent with the views you expressed in
response to our earlier memo, and which the Secretary believes is consistent with the
commitments he has made to the private school community:

        In light of the fact that some of the state and local defendants in the case will be filing a
petition for certiorari, and in light of his continuing concerns about the record in this case, the
Solicitor General will not file a separate petition for certiorari on behalf of the Secretary. He
will, however, file a responsive brief supporting the petition. The Solicitor General has prepared
a rough draft of his brief, which both we and the Secretary are very satisfied with. The draft
brief argues that programs to provide computers and other instructional materials to all students,
including those in sectarian schools, are vitally important and should be permitted, so long as
adequate safeguards are in place to provide reasonable assurance that they will be used for
secular, not religious, purposes, and so long as the public aid is supplementary to the religious
school's program. The brief recognizes that this will require the Supreme Court to re-examine
and partially overrule some of its precedents -- which now forbid such aid unless it is incapable
of diversion to religious purposes -- and argues that the time has come to do so. It urges the
Court to grant certiorari and issue a decision that announces the new "adequate safeguards" test
and remands the case to the Fifth Circuit for reconsideration, applying that new test. The
remand will have the virtue of permitting the Fifth Circuit to decided the case with the benefit of
the Department of education's Guidelines, which were issued after the original decision. This
improves the chances that the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court will find that the "adequate
safeguards" test has been satisfied in this case.
