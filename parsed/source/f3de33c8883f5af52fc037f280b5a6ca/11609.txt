TEXT:
Here's the changes in attendees for the Compo Worth meeting-- sounds like
Ray Fisher will come from DOJ. But Labor insists that Lee S. is the
person designated by Herman not Kitty Higgins. Treasury wants David
Wilcox, he wants to come but will be in Florida. His deputy knows the
issue and is supposed to be able to speak authoritatively -- according to
Karen Kornbluh.  Kaplan hasn't told us who (with Sally out) will come.
