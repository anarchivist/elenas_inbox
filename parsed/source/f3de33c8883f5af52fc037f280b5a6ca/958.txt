TEXT:
You should know that yesterday we published a Federal Register notice
announcing the availability of an (OMB-cleared)   USDA/FDA/CDC discussion
draft of the food safety report the President's requested.   The report is
due to POTUS April 24, and over the next two months we will consult
extensively with stakeholders on its content.   I'm hosting 10 short
meetings here next week with WH offices and agencies to hear from key
industry and consumer players, and the agencies are hosting two public
meetings in March.  Just wanted you to know in case any of the many
players on the issue feel they need to bend your ear as we go forward.
I'm working closely w/OMB (particularly Katzen) to keep us all on the same
page.   So far so good.
