                                  EQUAL PAY


     Policy Rational and Cost: Currently, American women earn about 75 cents for every
    dollar men earn. In the past, the Administration has announced a package of initiatives on
    equal pay, including endorsing legislation to strengthen enforcement of wage
    discrimination. This proposal suggests further steps the Administration can take (without
    legislation) in the EEOC and Department of Labor on this important issue. The measure
    includes: an education program for employees; new outreach to businesses to provide
    information on current law and offer technical assistance; and upgrading training for
    EEOC employees and resources for increases in enforcement capabilities. As a result of
    the initiative, EEOC states it will reach over 10 million workers through public service
    announcements and reach over 3000 small, medium, and large employers by providing
    technical assistance. The Department of Labor (Office of Federal Contract Compliance
    Programs) also seeks funding for a related Women in Non-Traditional Occupations
    Initiative, which will identify best practices, emphasize anti-discrimination and
    anti-harassment activities, and explore incentives to improve access for women into glass
    ceiling and nontraditional opportunities such as construction, technology, and
    manufacturing. (Cost: $17.3 million for EEOC and $10.4 million for DOL -- $6.8
    million for DOL's non-traditional occupations and $3.8 million for DOL equal pay
    outreach and compliance reviews).


     Uncertainty:      EEOC did not receive any of the $17.3 million in their pass back for this
    initiative, but they are appealing the entire amount. OMB did not fund this because they
    stated they prefer that EEOC continue to work on reducing its backlog, but OMB staff
    seems open to some funding for this initiative. DOL received only $383,000 out of the
    $6.8 million requested in a Women in Non-Traditional Occupations Initiative. OFCCP
    also requested $3.81 million in their base for the equal pay compliance reviews and
    outreach, but did not receive any of this request. DOL is currently not appealing any of
    the $10.4 million.

    Vetting: The agencies produced the equal pay proposal at our request.    The issue is
    one of the most important to Americans, and the proposal (while small) would certainly
    be greeted positively by groups active in the area. OMB implied to EEOC that they had
    to make a choice between reducing the backlog and undertaking this effort. We think
    both the equal pay measure and reducing the backlog are worthy of support.
