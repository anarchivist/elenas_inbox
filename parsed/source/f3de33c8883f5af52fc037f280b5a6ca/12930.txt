Facilitators: Charles Ogletree, Harvard Law School
              Christopher Stone, Vera Institute of Justice
Moderator: The President


1. HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION
Ogletree/Stone: The police chiefin a mid-size city is presented with requests from
neighborhood watch organizers and other residents in a minority, high crime neighborhood to
increase police patrols in that area. They particularly are concerned about young men loitering
on the comers and in front ofliquor stores, and they complain of gang activity and drug buys.
When the chief added patrols in the past, the police were criticized strongly by others from this
same community and civil rights activists for being heavy-handed.

Suggested Questions for THE PRESIDENT:

       1. Suggested Question to Hugh Price, National Urban League:
             What steps would you take to work with the police to meet the real needs of the
             neighborhood residents to combat crime, while also addressing the civil rights
             concerns?

       2. Suggested Question to Tom Frazier, Baltimore Police Department or Richard
          Green, Crown Heights Youth Center:
             What steps can a police department take to get community approval for increased
             crime control, without creating tensions and a perception of bias or lack of respect
             for residents?

       3. Suggested Question to Chuck Sha-King, Youth Force or Attorney General Reno:
             How can police best learn how to talk to youth?




                                                                 Automated Records Management System
2. HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

city that appear to be carrying gang members and to question the driver and passengers. Gang
activity in the city principally has involved gangs of African American, Hispanic, Asian, and
Eastern European young people.

The police chief has just come to the see the Mayor about a crisis. A few hours ago, two officers,
one white and one Hispanic, stopped a low-riding car carrying three teenage black males based
on a minor traffic violation, but something went terribly wrong. After the stop, there was an
argument and the officers thought they saw one of the passengers reach into the back seat; they
saw something shiny and thought it was a gun. They opened fire, injuring the driver and one of
the passengers. No gun was found in the car. However, there was a shiny metallic object
(wrench?) that may have been what the officers mistook for a gun.

The chiefis prepared to support a full investigation and let the chips fall where they may. She is
worried that the reaction to the incident may endanger her anti-gang traffic stop program, which
she believes has been crucial to bringing down crime. Her community meetings over the last few
years have convinced her that the public broadly supports this program. The mayor and chief of
police will hold a press conference in two hours.

Suggested Questions for THE PRESIDENT:

       1. Suggested Question to Robert Stewart, National Organization of Black Law
           Enforcement Executives or Bob Scully, National Association of Police
           Organizations:
              What strategy would you recommend to the Mayor if you were chief of police?

       2. Suggested Question to Gil Gallegos, Fraternal Order of Police or Kweisi Mfume,
          NAACP:
             As Mayor, what should your priorities be in responding to the incident? How
             broadly or narrowly do you want to focus the issue?

       3. Suggested Question to Ron Neubauer, International Association of Chiefs of
          Police:
              What policies have been successful in other cities in preventing these kinds of
              tragedies?




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

 ed pieces discussing the issues that the new chief should address. In one, the editorial board
 called on the chief to move beyond the slogans of community policing to the real spirit of
 community policing: giving local communities, particularly communities of color, a real say in
 how the police serve them.

Suggested Question for THE PRESIDENT:

        1. Suggested Question to Paul Evans, Boston Police Department or Wade
           Henderson, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights:
              What practical steps can we take to move us closer to the spirit of community
              policing in cities across this country?



IF TIME ALLOWS THE FOLLOWING OUESTIONS/SITUATIONS COULD BE
ADDRESSED:

4. QUESTION
Ogletree/Stone: Traffic stop enforcement is an important law enforcement tool for a variety of
reasons, not the least of which is traffic safety and decreasing traffic fatalities. Secretary Slater, I
know that you have a seat belt initiative that you believe is particularly important in the African
American community and in other communities of color. How will addressing the concerns of
racial profiling in traffic enforcement affect the receptiveness of these communities to your
initiative?


5. HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION
Ogletree/Stone: Police have been called to a minority neighborhood because a man who appears
to be mentally ill has been shouting abusively at residents. When two policemen arrive, they
announce that they are police, but the man responds by pulling out a knife. When the police
shout at the man that he should drop the knife, instead he lunges forward at one of the officers.
The other officer fires his weapon, seriously wounding the man. This incident has occurred
against the backdrop of increasing tensions between the police and members of the minority
community.

. Suggested Questions for THE PRESIDENT:

        1. Suggested Question to Dan Smith, National Sheriff's Association or Raul
           Yzaguirre, National Council of La Raza:
              If you are the chiefofpolice, what steps should you take to avoid community
              unrest?


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                  -3-                Hex-Dump Conversion
   Karen Narasaki, Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium:
      What steps should we be taking to minimize these types of incidents?

[This hypothetical could also be used as springboard for discussion of fact that some
incidents, while avoidable and tragic, and perhaps the result of lapses in police policy,
may not be ones that can or should be prosecuted.]

3. Suggested Question to Antonia Hernandez, Mexican American Legal Defense &
   Educational Fund:
      You are the police union representative for the officer involved in the shooting.
      Civil rights leaders are calling for prosecution of the officers. What position
      should you be taking?
