TEXT:
Thanks--I read your weekly report and your prediction on where the civil
rights groups might end up--I keep thinking there has to be a way through
this--I offer my help, because I think I have some credibility with these
folks--I'd like to meet with Wade (and whatever small group he thinks
works) this week and see if there's any way to bridge this gap; who's got
the most up to date read on the disputes between us and them?--I have to
tell you, while I understand all the advocates' arguments, it seems to me
that we have substantively come a very long way from simply focusing on
the no social promotion rhetoric.  You should know that the civil rights
groups were up on the hill today to review research on testing and social
promotion--so our task is getting tougher.
