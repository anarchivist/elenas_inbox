         First, congrats on a terrific meeting today!

         Two items on the early childhood brain development front:

      a.  Secretary Riley asked that I re-emphacize to you the research
      group he referenced that is working on early childhood work.    It is
      housed in the Department of Education Office of Educational Research
      and Improvement (OERI) and within OERI it is specifically the
 National
      Institute on Early Childhood Development and Education which is
      chaired by Naomi Karp ... Jeannine Smartt has worked with Naomi, I
      believe.

         I have learned that in 1995 Naomi established an Early Childhood
         Research Working Group which brings together the early childhood
 staff
      in 8 Federal departments and the GAO.   It is about 80 people who are
      involved in research, data collection, and ;or service delivery
      programs that affect children from birth through 8 years of age and
      their families.  The group meets four times a year, produces a
      quarterly newsletter, and has served as a mechanism that encourages
      partnerships across agencies. The next meeting is 1:30 p.m. to 3:30
      p.m. on February 5th in Room 326 of 555 Capital Place and I will be
      attending that meeting.  I know they would welcome White House
      participation if you all wish to send someone or even more than one
      person. This particular quarterly meeting will focus on how the
      country's collective knowledge bases about young children and
 families
      a=have benefited from the Federal investment in research and what
      issues are Federal agencies now struggling to answer.   Let me know if
      anyone/several people wish to go and I'll alert Naomi. I have asked
      her to send me some newsletters and previous reports, and I know she
      would be willing to send you a packet as well.

         They plan to have their next meeting on reading and early childhood,
         but I am sure they would speed up their research on this issue if you
         wish to use them as a resource.  It may be that this group has on it
         the very people who were suggested today to have around the table for
         a briefing for the White House.



     2. On February 19 I will be meeting in my office at 11 a.m. with
     Stephen Herb who is the President of the Association of Library
     Services for Children which is a division of the American Library
     Association. He is the head of the Education Library at Penn State
     University and his President is one of the 20 on our college work
     study steering committee.   He is an expert in children's literature,
     has a great deal of experience on outreach programs to parents, and
     has written a book on reading development for young children.
     Coming with him will be Susan Roman, exec. director of ALSC.   She
     has directed programs like the ones we envision in the Parents as
     First Teachers Grants, including the Head Start Museum project and
     the "Born to Read" project which the First Lady spoke of at the
     Children's Hospital just before Christmas.   I would welcome White
     House participation at this meeting as well.   It will be 30 minutes
     to an hour.==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================
