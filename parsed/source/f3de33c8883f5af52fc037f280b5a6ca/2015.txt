TEXT:
On Thursday, House Jud. Committee spent all day on the gang bill but did
not finish.  They will reconvene on Tuesday.

No signifcant amendments were adopted.

Schumer offered our child saftey lock amendment - - it was ruled
non-germane.  Ruling was upheld on a close vote, 11-10, due to low
attendance.

Schumer also offered our prosecutor grants amendment -- we lost 20-6.   All
Republicans and 3 Democrats voted against us.

Floor action is possible next week but very unlikely.
