This could be substantially shortened, but I'll let you make the call.   I
left out any recommendation on how this could be announced.  I've also

Narcotics Money Laundering-- The rapid increase in electronic commerce and immigrants' use
of international transfer services to send money home has caused the U.S. market for money
transmission services to grow steadily over the last ten years. Despite licensing procedures, the
money transmitter industry has proven vulnerable to abuse by organized money launderers. To
address this problem, the Treasury Department has the authority to require financial institutions
within a geographic area to comply with special reporting or record keeping obligations-- called
Geographic Targeting Orders (GTO). Currently, GTOs are temporary and can only be authorized
for 60-day periods.

A GTO issued on August 7, 1996-- which Treasury recently renewed--required 22 licensed
money transmitters in the New York metropolitan area to report information about the senders
and recipients of all cash transmissions to Columbia of $750 or more. Prior to the GTO,
remitters were only required to report transactions of more than $10,000 under Federal law. The
GTO has caused a dramatic reduction in the flow of narcotics proceeds in New York, thereby
denying drug trafficking cartels access to their profits. Several of the targeted money remitters
have stopped sending funds to Columbia altogether.

The Treasury Department is ready to release proposed rules which would expand the successful
Geographic Targeting Order (GTO) nationally, apply it to transactions to all nations, and make it
permanent. The proposed rules would also require money remitters to report suspicious activity.

Possible Announcement
The President could announce a nationwide crack down on narcotics money laundering through
the money transmitter industry by expanding the successful Geographic Targeting Order (GTO)
nationally and making it permanent.

The GTO in effect since August 1996 has caused a dramatic reduction in the flow of narcotics
proceeds in New York by requiring licensed money transmitters to report all cash-purchased
transmissions to Columbia in excess of $750-- denying drug trafficking cartels access to their
profits.

Background
Rapidly increasing electronic commerce and immigrants' use of international transfer services to
send money home to family has caused the U.S. market for money transmission services to grow
steadily over the last ten years. Despite licensing procedures, the money transmitter industry has
proven vulnerable to abuse by organized money launderers.

The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) allows the Treasury Department to require financial institutions in
a geographic area to comply with special reporting or record keeping obligations-- called
Geographic Targeting Orders (GTO). Currently, GTOs are temporary and can only be authorized
for 60-day periods.

The Current GTO
The GTO issued on August 7,1996 required 22 licensed money transmitters in the New York
metropolitan area and their approximately 3,500 agents to report information about the senders
and recipients of all cash transmissions to Columbia of $750 or more. Before the GTO, only
transactions more than $10,000 had to be reported under Federal law. The August 1996 GTO
expired on April 3, 1997. Ray Kelly signed the renewal of the GTO last week.

Results of the GTO
The GTO caused an immediate 30% reduction in the flow of narcotics proceeds to Columbia
through New York City money transmitters. Several of the targeted money remitters have
stopped sending funds to Columbia altogether.

There has also been a dramatic increase in the Customs Commission's interdiction and seizure
activities. Over $50 million in cash has been seized at the since the GTO went into effect-- a
four-fold increase over the previous years' totals.

Next Steps
We could have Rubin send a letter to the President, which responds to his request to make the
GTO permanent and apply it nationwide. Rubin's letter would announce his intention to issue
proposed rules to require money remitters to obtain identifying information on wire transfers in
excess of $750, and to report suspicious transactions.
