SUBJECT:      DPC Weekly Report

OeOOEducation ! Coverdell/Torrecelli Bill: DOn Wednesday the Senate Finance Co
mmittee approved legislation that would allow parents to save up to $2,000 a ye
ar in Education IRAs, and withdraw the money taxfree for elementary and seconda
ry education related costs including private school tuition, fees, books and co
mputers.   Currently, the Education IRAs are capped a't a $500 contribution annua
lly, and savings may only be withdrawn taxfree to be used for higher education
expenses. This bill, sponsored by Senators Coverdell and Torrecelli, is almost
  identical to one that you vetoed last year. Secretaries Rubin and Riley sent
a joint letter to the Hill opposing the bill and saying that if it' passed, they
 would recommend that you veto it again. Their letter explained that this prop
osal would provide little benefit to lower and middleincome families, and that
the money would be better spent on muchneeded school construction. Committee D
emocrats attempted to delete the IRA provision from the Coverdell/Torrecilli bi
11, and replace it with your school construction proposal, but voting largely a
long party lines, the Finance Committee defeated the amendment, 12B, and then a
pproved the original bill, with three committee Democrats in support.

 XP\      P6Q OHealth Care Update on Privacy Legislation: ONext Tuesday, Senator
Jeffords Labor Committee is scheduled to begin marking up its version of medica
1 records privacy legislation.   In your State of the Union, you called on the C
ongress to pass privacy legislation this year to ensure that medical records re
main confidential and are adequately protected against misuse. Although you in
dicated at the time that your preference was to pass legislation, you also stat
ed that you would use the regulatory authority KennedyKassenbaum law gave you t
o implement protections in August if the Congress had not passed legislation by
 then. The pledge to move forward on the regulation in August is driving the a
ttempt to develop bipartisan legislation later this month and early into June.
 There are numerous outstanding issues that could stand in the way of Congress
passing this legislation, including issues related to state preemption, law enf
orcement access to medical records, access to records by the research community
, and patient authorization for release of their medical records. However, the


 insurance industry and the business community may well be open to compromising
 on a strong privacy protection bill because they fear the implem~ntation of ou
r regulation and are at least as concerned that different states are developing
 privacy legislation that is difficult if not impossible to administer for nati
onal companies.  In short, they will trade the federal preemption of state laws
 for a number of provisions that they heretofore opposed. The Committee is wor
king over the weekend to prepare for the Chairmans mark; if they make significa
nt process towards resolving many of our topline issues, we may wish to authori
ze the release of a supportive letter from Secretary Shalala to encourage conti
nued progress.

OHealth Care Release of Africa Report:O Next week, USA Today is planning on r
eleasing a major story on the AIDS crisis in Africa. This report will no doubt
 highlight the fact that in subSaharan Africa, more than 11,000 additional peop
le become HIV+ every day and 10 million people in this region have already died
 from the disease (83 percent of all AIDS deaths to date).  The article will do
cument Sandy Thurmans recent trip to Africa and will preview the fact that you
will soon receive a detailed report documenting the problem and providing speci
fic policy recommendations. We are currently considering unveiling this report
in conjunction with the dedication of the NIH building being named after Senato
r Dale Bumpers which is tentatively scheduled for June 9.

OHealth Care Patients Bill of Rights Update:O Next week, Congressman Gephardt
 is planning to ask Congressman Marion Berry to introduce a resolution that beg
ins the process for a discharge petition to be filed for the Patients Bill of R
ights. Congressman Gephardts office believes that this would effectively highl
ight the Republican leaderships lack of commitment to moving this legislation t
his year.  They have requested that we publicly commend this action in order to
 increase attention for it. Our primary concern remains whether it will be per
ceived as an overly partisan act since there will be no Republican cosponsors 0
f this resolution at the time of its filing.  We are contemplating suggesting t
o Mr. Gephardt to wait to file this resolution until after the Memorial Day rec
ess to increase the likelihood that Republicans will cosponsor it (some of thes
e ~embers have indicated that they are going to give their leadership until the
 end of the recess to make such a commitment before they consider breaking part
y ranks) .

OHealth Care Innovative Nutrition/Lifestyles Demonstration Approved:   OWe info
rmed Dean Ornish that the Health Care Financing Administration, pending final a
nd expected OMB clearance, will be setting up a Medicare demonstration for his
nutrition / lifestyle program.  It will be designed exclusively for beneficiari
es who have heart disease, which government researchers and the advocates of th
is program believe would best measure the cost effectiveness of this program. T
he only remaining issue is determining appropriate reimbursement rates for the
program. HHS and OMB will likely want to review all the private market contrac
ts to determine an appropriate rate of reimbursement.  However, this is not exp
ected to be a major hurdle, and according to Nancy Ann Min DeParle, the demo sh
ould be up and running by late summer.

OOOHealth Care Market Oriented Approaches to Medicare are being Rejected by In
surers and Providers:O In 1997, the Administration successfully secured demons
tration authority to test market oriented approaches to purchase health care in
 the Medicare program. Specifically, we were given the authority to engage in c
ompetitive bidding for managed care, durable medical equipment, and other limit
ed services provided by the program. Having received this authority, we worked
 with HHS to set up demonstrations in Florida, Arizona, and Kansas. Ironically,
 the same industry representatives and members of Congress who frequently criti
que the program as being inefficient strongly oppose even this demonstration au
thority.  In every case, providers have balked and done everything possible to
stop these demonstrations, either by lobbying Congress to urge HCFA to delay or


 withdraw their plans, or through appealing to the courts to block our efforts.
  Our efforts have been largely validated by health policy analysts. In fact, t
he Wall Street Journal recently quoted Ira Loss, a leading equities researcher,
 as saying that Medicare providers are interested in the free market only if i
t means that the government is getting away from bothering them.  But when it c
omes to the government actually forcing them to compete for business, they are
unhappy about it.  This development points to the challenge we will have to ena
cting more nationally oriented competitive purchasing mechanisms as we unveil 0
ur Medicare reform proposal. XP\         P6Q

StyleD XX2PQ 00 XP\       P6Q OTobacco Recoupment:O As you know, we faced a diffic
ult battle on tobacco recoupment during the conference on the supplemental spen
ding bill. Regardless of our clear opposition to this proposal negotiators acc
epted a provision in the Senate bill to let states keep all tobacco settlement
funds without any commitment to spend funds to reduce youth smoking.   Despite 0
ur requests, none of our allies offered a simple alternative along the lines of
 a proposal we were dis·cussing with Democratic governors ensuring each state h
as a basic antiyouth smoking program by requiring each state to spend funds equ
al to a certain percent of their yearly settlement payments on such programs.
Senator Specter offered an all or nothing motion to drop the Senate provision a
ltogether, which failed.   Later, Representative Obey offered a complicated amen
dment requiring that 40 percent of the settlement be spent on health care and t
obacco prevention, which also failed.  We do, however, believe that the major p
ublic health groups know how hard we fought to amend this provision.   We recomm
end that in your signing statement for the supplemental bill that you say you a
re extremely disappointed that the Congress forfeited federal taxpayer claims t
o the tobacco settlement without any commitment whatsoever from the states to u
se a portion of the settlement funds to prevent youth smoking, that Congress pa
ssed up an important opportunity to protect our children from the death and dis
eases caused by tobacco, and that you will closely monitor state efforts in thi
s area and continue to fight for a nationwide effort to reduce youth smoking th
rough counteradvertising, prevention activities, and restrictions on youth acce
ss to tobacco products.

StyleDOOOTobacco International:O Secretary Shalala participated last week in
a meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva, pledging u.S. support for the
 World Health Organizations plans to develop a framework convention on tobacco
control. This convention would establish a multilateral framework to reduce to
bacco use worldwide. The framework is expected to take several years to develo
p and ratify and may be followed by negotiated protocols which would address sp
ecific obligations. The State Department has authorized HHS to lead the negoti
ating team for the framework convention which would include representatives fro
m the State Department and other interested agencies.   We will conduct an inter
agency process to coordinate these efforts. You may recall that during last ye
ars consideration of the McCain legislation, some members of Congress wanted to
 include provisions which would have imposed u.s. laws overseas, which the Stat
e Department and USTR strongly opposed.   These provisions were removed from the
 bill at our urging, and instead language was included Xx6X@DQ    XP\      P6Q encou
raging u.S. involvement in multilateral efforts such as this one.

OImmigration New Regulations:O    On May 20, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is
sued proposed rule implementing NACARA.  This rule seeks to address the inequit
ies created by NACARA for Salvadorans and Guatemalans but DOJ was legally unabl
e to address fully the inequities in this regulation.  In addition, consistent
with your statements during your recent trip to Central America, we are prepari
ng legislation that would address these inequities. On May 25, the Vice Presid
ent will announce a proposed rule to clarify that immigrants who receive Medica
id, Children Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and a variety of other benefits w
ill not face immigration penalties.


StyleO XX2PQ DO XP\       P6Q OWelfare Transportation Grants:O Last week, the Vice
 President released the first round of grants funded under your Access to Jobs
initiative which was enacted as part of last years transportation bill.  A tot a
I of $71 million will go to 179 urban, suburban and rural communities in 42 sta
tes to help welfare recipients and other lowincome workers get to where the job
s are. The Indianapolis Public Transit agency received a $500,00 grant on beha
If of a consortium of transportation providers including the organization that
employed Elaine Kinslow, the welfare to work success story you praised in last
years State of the Union.

OWelfare Linking WelfaretoWork and CensusO 02000:0 Also last week, the Depart
ment of Labor announced the availability of $20 million in WelfaretoWork funds
for a competitive project to employ welfare recipients as Census 2000 enumerato
rs and to connect these individuals with permanent jobs once the Census work en
ds. This collaborative effort between Labor and Commerce builds on the Census
Bureaus success in hiring over 4,700 welfare recipients. This initiative will
provide approximately 10,000 welfare recipients with wellpaying, flexible tempo
rary employment near their homes,while helping to improve the Census count in
lowincome neighborhoods.  We plan to explore announcement opportunities when a
grantee is selected this summer.

StyleOOOOWelfare Guide for Using TANF Funds: 0 HHS has released a helpful guid
e Helping Families Achieve Self-Sufficiency: A Guide on Funding Services for C
hildren and Families Through the TANF Program to illustrate how states may use
 TANF funds to support working families and address the heeds of families with
the greatest challenges.  We believe that the flexibility provided in the TANF
rule you announced on April 10th and the additional examples in this guidance w
ill inspire states and communities to use TANF funds in creative and constructi
ve ways to promote work and Xx6X@DQ   XP\        P6Q responsibility.

OCommunity Empowerment State of the Cities Report 1999: OAt the Conference of
 Mayors meeting in June, the Vice President will present HUD's State of the Cit
ies 1999. This report will underscore that we are witnessing an encouraging sh
ift in the state of the cities and a reversal of several fundamental trends tha
t often made cities seem like the problem centers of American life. The report
 will highlight the following important data:  1) wages are rising in central c
ities at a faster rate than the nation as a whole; 2) twothirds of central citi
es increased in population from 1980 to 1996; 3) central city urban unemploymen
t rates have fallen from 8.1 percent in 1992 to 4.8 percent today; 4) central c
ity poverty rates are at their lowest level since 1990; and 5) for the first ti
me in history, more than half of central city house holds are homeowners.  The
report credits these important changes to the growing economy and your economic
 plan, the Administration's community empowerment agenda, the success of privat
eprivate partnerships, and a revitalized HUD.  The report will also point out t
hat a significant number of central cities are still lagging behind, supporting
 the argument for strengthening the Administration's community empowerment stra
tegy, including passage of the New Markets Initiative, expanding the Low Income
 Housing Tax Credit, and enactment of XX2PQ   XP\        P6Q the Better American Bon
s program.
