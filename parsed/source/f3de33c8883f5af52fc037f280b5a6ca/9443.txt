 Q:    What do these new numbers tell us about the impact of welfare reform?

A:      While it is still early to see the full effects of welfare refonn, the evidence so far is very
       encouraging. Clearly there is no increase in poverty; poverty has decreased. In fact,
       the Census data show continued strong trends in the movement from welfare to work: the
       percentage of people on welfare in one year who were working in the following year has
       increased by nearly one-third since 1996, the year the President signed the welfare refonn
       law. This is occuring at the same time that welfare caseloads continue to decline
       dramatically.

Background
The percentage of people who were on welfare in one year and working the following year
increased by 28% -- from 26.5% in March 96 to 33.8% in March 1998 . The 3/98 figure
reflects people who said they were receiving welfare during 1997 and were working in March
1998. These data are included in the CPS files, but are not part of the infonnation Census
released publicly today.

Caseloads have declined 41 % since the President took office, and 32% since he signed the
welfare refonn law (using most recent data from June 98, which HHS released in August 98).
