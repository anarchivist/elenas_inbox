TEXT:
 Many of the initiatives the President has recently announced raise Puerto
Rico issues and some raise issues concerning the smaller territorial
areas. Many of the benefits would not apply to Puerto Rico because they
are tax credits, but the initiatives raise other issues as well relating
to the underlying programs not applying to the areas or only applying to a
limited extent.



We will not need to address the areas' treatment in the case of most of
the issues (e.g., tax credits) but we should seriously consider
territorial provisions in others. The noteworthy issues of which I am
aware are listed in the attached.   While most will not need to be
addressed, they are included because they will affect other issues such as
Puerto Rico's status debate. Those most likely to require attention are in
boild type.  ==================== ATTACHMENT    1 ====================
