ADVANCE EXCERPTS
REMARKS OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON
JACKSON MANN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, BOSTON
FEBRUARY 2, 1999


        This year we will have a great     debate in Congress about the next
steps to improve education in America.      There are some in Congress who
believe the national government has no     business investing more in public
education.  I believe they're wrong --     we should finish the job of hiring
100,000 teachers to reduce class size,     and pass our tax credit to build or
modernize 5,000 schools.

        But this debate is not just about money.   Some of those same
people argue that even though we spend $15 billion a year on public
education, the national government has no business holding the system
accountable for results.  I disagree with that, too.   Can you imagine any
company spending money without looking at results? I believe that as a
nation, we should say once and for all that no child in America should be
taught by an unprepared teacher.  No child in America should be passed
from grade to grade without having mastered the material. No child in
America should be trapped in a failing school.   The education of our
children must be a national priority, and holding our schools accountable
for results must be a national commitment.

        From now on, we must say to states and school districts:  Identify
your worst-performing, least improving schools, and turn them around, or
shut them down.  Today I am pleased to announce that the balanced budget I
submitted yesterday contains a new $200 million pool of flexible Title I
    ·

funds that states and schools districts can use to turn failing schools
around. We must make sure all schools are on the right track.   If we fail
to do this, and do it quickly, we are going to lose another generation of
children to low expectations, low educational achievement, and low
prospects of moving ahead in life.
