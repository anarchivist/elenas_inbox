      MAKING TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE UNIVERSALLY AVAILABLE, AND
                PROMOTING A LIFETIME OF LEARNING
                                                 September 26, 1997

     President Clinton fought for a Bipartisan Balanced Budget that included a $1,500 HOPE Scholarship
     and a Lifetime Learning Tax Credit for middle income families, and a $3,000 maximum Pell Grant
     scholarship for lower-income families. Today the President will release a new report which shows how
     these initiatives will help ensure that anyone can afford tuition and fees for two years at a community
     college, and highlights how community colleges are providing a high-quality education and preparing
     millions of Americans to participate in the 21st Century economy. The President will also challenge
     Congress to follow through on the Balanced Budget Agreement, not shut the door on thousands of adult
     students.

     Community Colleges are Dynamic Institutions that Provide a High Quality, Affordable Education.
     Today the President travels to San Jacinto College, near Houston, to release a new report on community
     colleges by the U.S. Department of Education. Fifty years after the Truman Commission Report called
     for a nationwide network of public community colleges, this report highlights the critical role being
     played by community colleges in preparing the workforce of the 21 st Century. The report describes
     how these institutions provide a high quality education to a diverse array of Americans at various stages
     in their lives and careers, and underscores that community colleges are remarkably affordable, with
     average tuition and fees expected to run just over $1,300 next fall.

     The HOPE Scholarship Cuts Tuition and Fee Costs at Community Colleges by 88%. New projections by
     the Department of Education indicate that in the 1998-99 school year, the HOPE Scholarship will cover
     up to 88 percent of the national average full-time tuition and fees at community colleges. In seven
     States, including Texas, HOPE covers up to 100 percent of community college tuition and fees. In 35
     States, the HOPE Scholarship covers up to 75 percent or more of tuition and fees. 5.8 million
     students are expected to benefit from the HOPE Scholarship at all types of higher education institutions.

     Pell Grants Will Benefit 1.4 Million Community College Students. The Department of Education estimates
     that 1.4 million community college students will receive an average Pell Grant in 1998-99 of $1,810.
     Pell Grants are available on a sliding scale based on income and can be used to cover tuition and fees as
     well as living expenses associated with college. The Bipartisan Balanced Budget Agreement includes the
     President's proposal for the largest increase in the grant in two decades, to a maximum of $3,000. Some
     students will qualify for both a Pell Grant and a tax credit (HOPE or Lifetime).

     7.1 Million Will Benefit from Lifetime Learning Tax Credit. For students beyond their first two years of
     college, including those who are returning to school (full or part time) to upgrade their skills or change
     careers, the Taxpayers Relief Act offers a 20 percent tax credit for the first $5,000 of tuition and fees paid
     by a student. It is expected that 7.1 million students will take advantage of the credit to help pay for
     postsecondary education.

     Many Adults Who Return to School Will be Shortchanged if Congress Does Not Finish the Job.
     Unless Congress follows through on the President's Pell Grant proposals -- as required by the Bipartisan
     Balanced Budget Agreement -- more than half a million adult students will find that their income is too

     low for them to benefit from HOPE (because they do not have sufficient tax liability), but they are not
     considered poor enough for a sufficient PeU Grant (223,000 will not be eligible for a grant at aU).
     Those affected are students over 24 or veterans, and are either single or married without dependent
     children. A House-Senate conference committee is currently considering this issue. If they do not
     act to address this problem, college may be out of reach for students like a 22-year-old veteran
     making only $10,000 a year, a married 35-year-old with joint income of only $14,000, or a
     30-year-old with income of only $11,000.
