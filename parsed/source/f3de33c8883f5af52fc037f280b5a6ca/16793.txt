   PENDING AUTHORIZATION CONFERENCE REPORTS

   Intelligence Authorization Conference Report -- Conferees will meet on
   Tuesday, September 2nd, and intend to file a report by the end of the
   week.   Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet sent a letter to
   Conferees this week stating that "the PresidentD,s senior advisors will
   recommend that he veto the bill if it contains the whistleblower provision
   in its present form."  Conferees reportedly may alter the language/scope
   of the provision, but keep it the bill.

   Defense Authorization Conference Report -- Conferees plan to meet the
   second week of September. We issued a veto threat for the following
   provisions: Bosnia, whistleblower, DOE funding, B-2, and depot maintenance.

   Foreign Operations Authorization Conference Report --  Prior to the
   recess, conferees completed conferencing on the bill, with the exception
   of the family planning provision. We issued a veto threat in our SAP for
   any provision that "imposes unwarranted restrictions on international
   family planning programs."
