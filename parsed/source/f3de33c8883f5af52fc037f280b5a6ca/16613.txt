MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report




        1. Welfare Reform: Council of Economic Advisers' Analysis of Child-Only Cases -- In
response to a recent item in CEA's weekly economic briefing on the growth of child-only welfare
cases, you asked whether certain features of the welfare law need to be fixed.

        The issue is that one part of the law appears to treat states with growing numbers of
child-only cases unfavorably, while another part of the law is too generous to such states. Since
child-only cases count when measuring a state's caseload reduction credit, a growing child-only
caseload reduces the size of that credit -- and means a state must put more people to work. On
the other hand, a state with more child-only cases can grant more "hardship exceptions" to the
5-year time limit. This is because these cases are included in the denominator of the 20
hardship exception calculation despite the fact that none of them need the exception because they
are excepted elsewhere in the law.

        We do not believe a fix is needed at this time. On the caseload reduction credit, the
tremendous decline in welfare caseloads is already making the work participation rates far easier
to meet than expected. In addition, letting states calculate the credit by excluding child-only
cases might even give states an incentive to sanction parents and create more child-only cases.
Regarding time limits, we are loath to re-open the issue of time limit exceptions so early in the
implementation process and when there are many groups (battered women, disabled, etc.) that
are pressing for more exceptions, not fewer in this area.

       2. Welfare Reform: Agreement in New York State and California on Welfare -- In
the past week or so, state officials in New York State and California finally reached agreement
on welfare plans.
                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

        New York State passed a budget that includes its welfare changes. The new law requires
that all individuals able to work must accept a workfare assignment offered to them. New
parents are exempt from work requirements until the infant is 3 months old, with extensions
allowed until the age of one. The plan also exempts from work those who are over 60, ill or
incapacitated, or needed in the home because of the illness or incapacity of a family member. In
response to a recent notorious case where a woman on general assistance with a history of illness
died on a work assignment, counties must make work assignments consistent with an
individual's limitations and consider an individual's medical reports. Counties must allow
workfare on college campuses for students on welfare, an idea Mayor Giuliani has resisted and
continues to resist. The plan also increases the amount of earnings that can be disregarded for
welfare purposes. Child care will be provided for children under 13 whose parents are assigned
to work. The state will construct a system of incentives and penalties for counties to encourage
them to move people from welfare to work. The final plan preserves current benefit levels,
rejecting Governor Pataki's proposal to keep dropping benefits as a family approaches the five
year time limit. The legislature also rejected Pataki's plan to block grant TANF funds to
counties.

       After five years, families with children can move to a "safety net" program that features
non-cash benefits (presumably using state rather than federal funds). Also in this program are
those without children and immigrants not eligible for federal funds.

        New York chose to take advantage of a new state option to purchase food stamps from
USDA for legal immigrants who will otherwise lose benefits under federal law on August 22.
New York will buy food stamps for elderly or disabled legal immigrants and legal immigrant
children, which will preserve benefits for about two-thirds oflegal immigrants.

        After a confrontation in California last month that culminated in Governor Wilson's veto
of a Democratic bill, the Governor and the legislature reached an agreement earlier this week.
They compromised on a plan to limit new welfare recipients to 18 months of benefits, with a
six-month extension option. Current recipients can get 24 months of benefits and then must
leave the rolls for at least a year before they can requalify for benefits. Able-bodied adults must
work or be in training for at least 20 hours a week; in the year 2000, that requirement increases to
32 hours a week. Women with infants are exempt from the work requirements for three months
to one year, at the county's option. Children can continue to get aid after their parents reach the
five-year lifetime limit. The state also enacted a lifetime ban on welfare for convicted drug
felons. Democrats were unable to win approval of assistance to legal immigrants losing federal
food stamps, or of a partial state takeover of the state general assistance program.

        3. Welfare: Child Support Enforcement -- In light of the recent GAO study criticizing
states for not putting in place automated child support enforcement systems, you asked how we
have increased collections by 50 percent since 1992 and what more we could do. While as many
as eight states have told HHS that their computer systems won't be ready for certification by
October 1st, some of those states are using computers in some parts of their states already. Even


                                                 2
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
the GAO report acknowledges that the systems in place have helped those states improve
collections. The real problem is that this October 1st deadline is only for the computer systems
needed to implement the provisions of the 1988 Family Support Act -- all of these computer
systems will need to be updated and revised to enforce the new hire reporting, license revocation,
centralized state collections, and paternity establishment rules enacted as part of welfare reform.
And, as you noted in your July 28th speech to the National Governors' Association, not all states
have even put in place the required state child support laws necessary to begin implementation of
the new provisions.

        Of course, increased federal and state efforts made even before the new law have paid off.
As you know, we increased child support collections from $8 billion in 1992 to $12 billion in
1996. But during the same time the percentage of cases in which we collected support remained
nearly constant at 20 percent, because both the number of overall cases and the number of cases
with collections both increased. And despite our increased collections, we still collect only a
fraction of Wh\lt's owed. For example, in fiscal year 1995, states collected $8.2 billion of the
$15.5 billion of current support owed and $2.4 billion of the $34.5 billion of past support owed, a
collection rate of 54 percent for current support and 7 percent for past support.

        We believe that post-Balanced Budget Act, we should devote more attention to ensuring
states are implementing the tough new rules enacted last year. This is one reason why we
suggested that in your speech to the National Governors' Association you take states to task over
child support enforcement and were pleased that you urged "all the states to put in place these
tough, state-wide child support collections mechanisms as fully and quickly as possible."

        Now that you've issued the challenge, we need to help make it happen. We propose to
establish a child support enforcement oversight working group with DPC, NEC,
Intergovernmental Affairs and key HHS, Treasury, and Dept. of Justice staff to track state efforts
and devise ways to ensure they do all they can to build a stronger child support enforcement
system.

         4. Welfare Reform: Tuesday's Event in St. Louis with the Welfare to Work
Partnership -- On Tuesday you will travel to St. Louis to underscore the critical role of the
private sector in welfare reform, praising approximately 200 St. Louis companies that will
commit to hire and retain welfare recipients. We suggest you use the opportunity to hail the
success of welfare reform nearly one year after making reform the law of the land. We will
have new caseload numbers for you to announce (the rolls have declined by almost 3.4 million or
24% since you took office). We would also suggest you highlight your successes in the
Balanced Budget Act, which fixes the problems you promised to fix when you signed the law
and includes a welfare-to-work tax credit and a $3 billion fund to help move a million more
people from welfare to work. You could also announce that the Welfare to Work Partnership
stands ready to help companies all across the nation hire people off welfare, with their "Blueprint
f9r Business" guide and other information which will be available starting Tuesday through
their toll free hotline and their web page.

                5. Education: Lawsuit on High Stakes Testing in North Carolina -- This week the
        New York Times and other newspapers reported that the NAACP Legal Defense Fund has filed a
        federal lawsuit against the Johnston County School District in eastern North Carolina,
        challenging a year-old policy which requires all students in grades 3 through 8 to achieve a
        specified score on the North Carolina state reading and math tests before they can be promoted to
        the next grade. The case is one of the nation's first federal court challenges involving state
        education standards and high stakes testing.

                The suit was brought on behalf of the parents of 14 black, Hispanic, and white students
        who failed the tests. The parents claim that the tests violate the equal protection rights of
        minority students, who disproportionately obtain low scores, and that the district's test procedure
        discriminates against special education students by failing to provide accommodations, such as
        extra time. The plaintiffs suggest that the North Carolina state tests were designed to measure
        how well schools and school systems are teaching the state mandated curriculum, but are not a
        valid measure of individual student performance. Domestic Policy Council staff has requested a
        meeting with the Department of Justice to discuss the case.

                 6. Immigration: Revamping the Immigration System -- The U.S. Commission on
        Immigration Reform has prepared a draft report on structural reforms to the current immigration
        system. One of their options for reform is to abolish the Immigration and Naturalization Service
        (INS) and delegate its main functions to the Departments of State, Labor, and Justice. Under
        this scenario, the Department of Justice would be responsible for immigration enforcement,
        including the Border Patrol, investigations, detentions, and deportations; the State Department
        could perform functions relating to immigration benefits, services, and visa processing; and the
        Department of Labor would have responsibility for all workplace-related immigration activities.
        The report makes no assessment of operational difficulties posed by this option, nor an estimate
        of cost.

                The report also provides other options for structural reforms including: establishing a new
        Cabinet-level department or independent agency; creating an Office for Immigration Policy at the
        Domestic Policy Council; and establishing a standing body responsible for immigration policy
        development, similar to the EEOC or the FCC. The Commission's final report will be released
        in late September.

               7. Crime: Community Policing Grants -- On Thursday, August 7, the COPS Office
        released $92 million in universal hiring grants to fund approximately 1,300 officers in 48 states.
        To date, the COPS program has funded an estimated 63,000 police officers and deputies.
