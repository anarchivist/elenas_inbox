 TEXT:
.One more concern:  I don't think DOJ should get into drafting the tort
 fund for these guys. That is a much more complex question than their
 draft suggests, and they should just flag it as an issue that needs to be
 resolved.

Also, why would attys fees go into Title XII?   Wouldn't it be an issue
with state suits as well?
