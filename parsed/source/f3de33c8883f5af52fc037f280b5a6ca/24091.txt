                                       Q&A on Tobacco Settlement            Automated Records Management System
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
                                            June 20, 1997

     Q.    Did the Administration help close the deal?

     A.    No. My staff monitored the talks closely so that we would be in a position to evaluate and
           respond to any possible settlement. We consistently told the parties that they would have to
           close an agreement on their own, and they were able to do so without any help from the
           Administration.

     Q.    How will you proceed?

     A.    I have asked my Domestic Policy Advisor, along with the Secretary of Health and Human
           Services, to undertake a thorough public health review of this agreement. They will consult
           with all interested agencies, members of Congress, and the public health community.

     Q.    How long will the review take?

     A.    The review will take as long as necessary to conduct a careful analysis, but we will seek to
           work promptly and expeditiously. We expect this to be a matter of weeks, not months.

     Q.    Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop have asked in a letter to you that you give them 30 days to
           complete their own review before signing off on anything. Are you going to wait?

     A.   . I intend to consider closely the views of the public health community, including Drs. Koop
            and Kessler, before rendering any judgment on the settlement. But it is premature to commit
            to any firm timetable for reaching my conclusion.

     Q.    What will you look at in evaluating this agreement?

     A.    We will evaluate whether this agreement protects the public health -- and particularly the
           health of our children. We will pay special attention to the part of the agreement dealing with
           FDA jurisdiction. The actions the FDA has taken under this Administration forced the
           industry to the bargaining table, and we will insist that the FDA has all necessary authority to
           regulate nicotine and tobacco products. We also will carefully review the financial terms of
           the settlement, including whether the money will go toward protecting the health of our
           children and the general public.

     Q.    The final deal limits punitive damages -- a key concession to the tobacco industry.
           Won't you oppose that given your previous opposition to caps on punitive awards?

     A.    The limitation on punitive damages for past misconduct is not a deal-breaker for us. We
           understand that the attorneys general extracted substantial concessions from the tobacco
           companies for this limitation, and we will evaluate whether the agreement as a whole
           advances the nation's public health interests.

     Q.    Are you taking a political risk in considering approval of this settlement?

     A.    This isn't about politics; it's about protecting the public health. We didn't think about
           politics when we took on the tobacco companies last year with our announcement of the FDA
