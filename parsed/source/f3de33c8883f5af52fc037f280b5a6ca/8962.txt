TEXT:
Elena,
Though it is still unclear whether the Republicans will bring their H-IB
to the floor tomorrow, we wanted to be prepared with a SAP just in case.
Attached is a draft of a veto SAP.

According to Peter, it is still possible that we can reach a deal with
Abraham on a better bill. However, if they introduce the current version,
we would likely want to send this up.

DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
August 6, 1998
(House)

H.R. 3736 - Workforce Improvement and Protection Act of 1998
(Smith (R) Texas and 3 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3736, the
D&Workforce Improvement and Protection Act of 1998,08 as amended.   If this
bill is presented to the president, his senior advisors will recommend
that he veto it.

This bill is intended to respond to a skills shortage in the information
technology industry by increasing the annual cap on the number of
temporary visas for foreign D&specialtyD8 workers under the H-IB program.
Regrettably, H.R. 3736, as amended, emphasizes providing opportunities for
foreign workers rather than providing opportunities for and protecting
U.S. workers.

The Administration supports sound and balanced legislative efforts to
address shortages of skilled workers within certain sectors of our
economy. The most important way to increase the availability of skilled
workers must be to improve the skills of U.S. workers and ensure that
employers seek U.S. workers first. While it may be necessary in the

.r. .
        short-term to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers,
        this must only be done in conjunction with additional efforts to increase
        the skill level of U.S. workers, including through enhanced training
        programs, and meaningful reforms to the H-IB program.

        Although this bill provides for certain employers to attest to recruitment
        and lay-off provisions, the attestations are too weak to adequately
        protect U.S. workers and far too many employers are exempt from their
        obligations. Moreover, the bill, as structured, will not generate
        sufficient funds for increased training opportunities for U.S. workers.
        Finally, rather than strengthening enforcement to prevent employer abuses
        of the H-IB program, H.R. 3736, as amended, undermines some of the
        programD,s important enforcement provisions.

        The Administration wants to work with the Congress to develop a bill that
        addresses the growing demand for highly skilled workers, while effectively
        protecting and promoting the interests of U.S. workers and enhancing the
        international competitiveness of important u.s. industries in a manner
        consistent with our international obligations.
