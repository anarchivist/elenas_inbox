TEXT:
Folks--I am sending you Ann's comments on this Women's Suffrage event and
museum/task force issue. As you can see, I am trying to work backwards to
find out exactly what has been committed to and communicated, particularly
with the Hill. Help.

Oh good -- I feel better knowing that you were the source of the request
to counsel. Now about what to do next: I agree this should be lower
priority; but I am concerned after Sondra's e-mail that some congressional
offices have had their impression fo the President's support confirmed
--so that it may now be difficult to get out of doing a letter
altogether. You may want to check with Leg about this.    And you probably
do want to get a response from DPC about the concept of a museum, what
would be required to look into this., etc. So that we have a more
substantive answer to why we are not able to just go forward and
commission a task force.
