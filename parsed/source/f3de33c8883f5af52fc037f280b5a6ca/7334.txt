TEXT:
Rahm/Bruce/Elena:

please disregard the assaults letter I sent. The word from Peter now is
that OMB will do a general veto letter, include the attached line on
assaults, and float it at the senior staff meeting tomorrow morning.

"The proposed language would potentially allow for as many as 600,000
modified Uzis, AK 47s and other assault-type rifles to be imported into
the country."

Thanks,
Jose'
