TEXT:
My (careful and competent) staff notes that FY89 was a Reagan submission.
See below. Also a typo. Therefore, one should say:

If we look at the President's Budget proposals (vs what Congress enacted),
then we can say the following about Title X requests:

From FY90 to its last budget submission for FY93, the Bush Administration
proposed increases in Title X totalling $11 million over 4 years.
From FY94 to FY97, also 4 years, the Clinton Administration proposed $69
million in increases.   [Unfortunately, we didn't get our full proposals.]
In the FY99 budget, the President will propose an additional $15 million
increase.  If enacted, it will be the largest increase achieved by this
Administration.   [Congress, on its own, enacted a larger increase for
FY93, to $173 from the previous year's $150m.]

Budget

This is not a big deal, but after we spoke I went and checked the
transmittal dates of the FY89 and FY90 Budgets.

FY89 was transmitted by Reagan in January, 1988.

FY90 was transmitted by Reagan on Jan. 9, 1989

FY90, Round II, was transmitted by Bush on Feb. 9, 1989, and superceded
the Reagan FY90 Budget.
