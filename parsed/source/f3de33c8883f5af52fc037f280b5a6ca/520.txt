TEXT:
OMB tells me that Bruce has draft chapters of the budget on
welfare reform and other issues. They particularly want me to
look at the children's SSI section -- which they are rewriting
anyway and sending directly to me, so I am not asking you to track
down Bruce's copy. However, it might be useful for me to see the
whole welfare reform section at some point before it's final,
which I hear will be in the next few days .... I guess there is
even the theory that the whole staff should see their relevant
chapters.
