TEXT:
Thanks for the feedback.   I've thought about the Black Caucus meetings and
whether I should attend.   I assume I should, though Andy set them up as
sessions for he and Tanya, and I have not had a chance to discuss his
reasoning behind that.   I want to hear him out before deciding what
combination of people will be the most effective.

I'll touch base with you Monday morning about setting up the test strategy
meeting on Monday.
