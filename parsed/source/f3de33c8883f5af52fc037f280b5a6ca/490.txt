Message Creation Date was at   9-DEC-1996 11:29:00

Rich Tarplin spoke to Ron Haskins, Moinihan, and Rangel about the NY state
plan. They are all fine with the HHS Regional Administrator calling her contact
at the NY Dept of Social Services to say the following:

HHS is unable to certify your plan complete because you say you need
legislation to implement the 5 year time limit. You can cure this by telling
us that you understand that you can only use federal funds for 5 years (the
Regional Adminstrator will explain that Ca has just done this and their plan
was certified complete). If NY can tell HHS this by feb 1, NY will get TANF
funds retroactive to the date of plan submission.

This call is scheduled for 1:30 pm. The same call will be made to NJ. Rich
spoke to Ron about NJ but felt that the NJ delagation would not be a problem.

Let me know if you have any problems/questions.
