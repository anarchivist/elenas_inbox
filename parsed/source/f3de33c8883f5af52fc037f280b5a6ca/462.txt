TEXT:
Here's where I think we are on the various items we need to
respond on to HHS this week:
1.    Q/A from 10/23 -- KEITH: I just sent over to you some edits
from HHS to their draft from last week.    I had told John your
staff would be working with the ACF and ASMB folks today and
tomorrow with the goal of signing off early this week.
2.    MEDICAID issues: Please check the following summary:
         - (b)/(d) waiver issue -- I think we are all OK with HHS
           option #3.   I will give them the go-ahead on that this
           morning
           all-or-none issue -- I sense a sea change in our view on
           this issue.   I will let HHS know that they do not have
           the go-ahead to go with the "all" answer. We should
           regroup by phone on this this morning
         - Medicaid Manual -- we need to let them know by Tues a.m.
           if there is anything we want them to pullout of the
           manual before the meetings this week with the states.
           DIANA: can you check in with OMB and get back directly
           to Sally
         - Paper on $500M and on TANF/Medicaid eligibility: same as
           manual. Need to let HHS know if we have any objections
           to their approach. DIANA: can you coordinate with OMB
           and get back to Sally directly?
3. TANF state plan issues
         - Six states with minor timing issues: unless Keith/Elena
           Diana/Emily get back to me this morning with a
           significant problem on their proposal, I would like to
           give them the goahead to proceed on the six states with
           minor TANF timing issues
         - NY/NJ/CAL -- bigger issues; everyone should read this


          paper closely, and I will schedule a conversation on this
          for Wednesday.
4.  Technicals
        I will call Rich this morning.  I will tell him our general
framework on timing: i.e., won't be done this week; will try to
get something out by next week -- LRD in charge, but I will give
him a few big comments like drop the bucket, drop the change in
penalties, and drop the Title XX transfer. After that, I will
tell him, his staff needs to work through LRD. Goal is to have at
least a small package up there next week.

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE TIMETABLES
A

ND ASSIGNMENTS ABOVE ..   THANKS, JEREMY
