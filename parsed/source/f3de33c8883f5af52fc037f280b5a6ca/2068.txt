TEXT:
This is the list of upcoming crime events I ran by Rahm yesterday.   The
feedback he gave in today's crime meeting is that he wants the Police
Memorial Event to focus on guns and pushing for our juvenile justice
bill. He thinks the President should 1) Announce new brady forms are
going out to FFL's that day, and 2) Push for inclusion of mandatory child
safety locks in juvenile justice legislation.  He is fine with including a
proposal to expand the Deegan Bill to state and local officers, but wants
the main message of the event to be, "No background check, No gun." He
did not comment on the high-tech stuff, i.e.) smart guns, concealed
weapons tech.
