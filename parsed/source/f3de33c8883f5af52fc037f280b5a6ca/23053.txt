      H.R. 800 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
               (Rep.Castle (R) DE and 59 cosponsors)


The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 800, which would
expand the "Ed-Flex" demonstration authority to permit all States to
waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements of Federal education
programs. The Administration has long supported the concept of
expanding ed-flex demonstration authority in a manner that will promote
high standards and accountability for results, coupled with increased
flexibility for States and local school districts to achieve those results.

[ Do we need to add another sentence supporting amendments to
provide further accountability or enhance parental involvement, as
on the Senate position?? 1

The Administration strongly supports an amendment [ that is expected to
be offered (?) 1to H.R. 800       that would implement the President's
proposal for a long-term extension of the one-year authority to help
school districts reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress
approved last year on a bipartisan basis. In order to hire qualified
teachers, arrange for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are
necessary to reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as
possible, that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more
than one year.
