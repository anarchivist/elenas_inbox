     Here's most of the briefing paper for tomorrow's event.  There is an event
     meeting a 4pm that will give me confirmations on the speaking program and
     audience members, but I wanted to give you what I had so far.  Let me know
     if there is anything other than the sequence of events, participants, and
     audience (info. I'll have soon!) that you need me to adjust.

                             INITIATIVE ANNOUNCEMENT

                         DATE:            January 14, 1999
                         LOCATION:        Alexandria Police Department
                         BRIEFING TIME: 1O:00am - 10:25am
                         EVENT TIME:      11:05am -11:50am
                     FROM:         Bruce Reed

I.    PURPOSE

      To announce to the law enforcement community the inclusion in the FY 2000 budget of
      nearly $1.3 billion for a new 21st Century Policing Initiative. The new 21st Century Policing
      Initiative builds on your successful COPS program by helping communities to continue to
      hire, redeploy, and retain police officers; giving law enforcement access to the latest
      crime-fighting technologies; and targeting funds to engage the entire community in preventing
      and fighting crime -- including community, prosecutors, probation and parole officers, school
      officials, and faith-based organizations. National law enforcement organizations all support
      extension of the COPS program.

      You will also release new crime statistics from the Justice Department showing that crime
      rates will continue to drop significantly in 1998.

II.   BACKGROUND

      As you know, your COPS Initiative has helped to fund over 92,000 additional
      community policing officers and awarded over $5.3 billion in grants to police and sheriffs
      departments across the nation. Over 11,300 state and local law enforcement agencies
      receive COPS funds -- more than half of the nation's policing agencies -- which serve
      nearly 90 percent of the American public. In addition, COPS has helped trained over
      21,000 law enforcement officers and community members, and targeted special programs
      to combat youth firearms violence, gangs, and domestic and school violence. Without
      new funds, however, the COPS program would be phased out this year, shortly after meeting
      its goal of helping communities put 100,000 more police on the street.

      Your FY 2000 budget proposes nearly $1.3 billion -- and $6.375 billion over five years -- for
      a new 21 st Century Policing Initiative to prevent the COPS program from lapsing and to help
      communities build on their efforts under the successful COPS. Specifically, it proposes:
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion



- $600 million for more police on the street_ These funds would be used primarily to hire
and redeploy between 30,000 and 50,000 more law enforcement officers over five years, with
an effort to target new police officers to crime "hot spots." A portion of the funds would also
be dedicated to help economically-distressed communities absorb the long-term costs of their
new police hires, as well as for special programs to train, educate, and recruit police officers.

- $350 million for crime-fighting technologies. These funds would be used to help state
and local enforcement agencies tap into new technologies that will allow them to
communicate more effectively, solve more crimes, and conduct comprehensive crime
analysis. Examples include:

        Improved police communications. The World Trade Center and Oklahoma City
        bombings dramatically illustrated the need for police to communicate effectively in
        joint operations. In Alexandria, the police department is piloting a number of
        different technologies (computers, wireless communications, videocams, software,
        and databases) that will enable police and other public safety officials to communicate
        and send data and images seamlessly across many jurisdictions. Your initiative allow
        other communities to do the same, as well as to improve their communications in
        other ways.

        New crime-solving technologies. We can solve many more crimes by improving the
        nation's overburdened and underfunded crime labs. Your initiative proposes making
        high-end technologies -- such as DNA analysis, photo enhancement and voice
        recognition -- available to even the smallest police departments.

        Bolstering Crime Analysis. As more police departments move toward community
        policing, many have found that their greatest tool is real-time crime and arrest data,
        which allows them to achieve a detailed understanding of their crime problem and
        determine how to best combat it. A notable example is New York's COMPSTAT
        project, which utilizes computerized statistics and mapping to analyze crime trends
        and allocate police resources. Your new initiative will help local police departments
        tap into crime mapping and other technologies that will improve the police's ability to
        quickly analyze, predict and respond to local crime problems.

- $200 million for Community Prosecutors and "Neighborhood DAs." As police and
community residents have joined forces to fight crime on a proactive basis, communities are
also turning to local prosecutors to playa more active role in the crime-fighting effort. In
Multnomah County, OR, "Neighborhood DAs" work closely with local police, spend time in
neighborhoods, and help solve local crime problems. "Your initiative will help communities
throughout the country do the same by hiring more community-based prosecutors imd
developing community-based prosecution programs.

- $125 million for community-wide crime prevention. Finally, your 21st Century Policing
proposes specifically targeting funds to engage the entire community in preventing and
fighting crime. These funds could be used to: work with probation and parole officers in
supervising released offenders; work with local school officials in adopting community-wide
plans to prevent school violence; involve faith-based organizations in juvenile crime
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


       prevention; and establish citizens' police academies that teach neighborhood residents
       problem-solving skills.

       New Mid-year data for 1998. You will also announce that today, for the first time, the
       Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) will release mid-year data showing
       that crime rates will continue to decline in 1998. According to BJS, the total number of
       violent crimes -- including crimes not reported to police -- is expected to fall below 3 million
       in 1998 for the first time since the start of its National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973.
       Property crimes will also continue to decline to record lows. By the end of 1998, both
       violent and property crime rates will have fallen by well over 20 percent since 1993.
