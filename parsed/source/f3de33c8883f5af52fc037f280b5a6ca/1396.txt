TEXT:
I assume you're both aware that Katie called Briuce the minute she saw
your announcement of the meeting. As I am sure you know, CEQ is the lead
on brownfields. You guys had a very early role because of the tax
incentive. But Katie wants to make sure that Bruce is clear in the
meeting and in talking about brownfields at the meeting in acknowledging
CEQ's lead. We really have to be careful not to step on each other's
issues.  This - we assume - is a one-time thing and we'll resume regular
order after this meeting.
