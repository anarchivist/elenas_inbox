 You should have just received LRM 1 - HHS (Golden) testimony for tomorrow
 morning's (11/20/96) Senate Labor Committee hearing on the well-being of abused
 and neglected children. HHS has requested that we clear its testimony this
 afternoon.   Comments are due to me by 3 p.m. today.  This is a firm deadline
      Thank you for your help.
