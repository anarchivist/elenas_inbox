        TEXT:
        Things continue to heat up on this issue ... I'm sending over copies of
        letters and press releases of interest from FCC Commissioners for your
        information.  Please take the time to review because you will see that
        Distilled Spirits thinks the letter from Reno to Hundt is the President's
        response to them.  They are waiting on a response from POTUS to their
        letter asking him to convene a meeting.

          Open Agenda meeting at FCC is tomorrow.   And so far two of the
         Commissioners have come out opposed to consideration of this issue.

        I just got an urgent message from Tim Dudgeon with Distilled Spirits
        regarding a letter that went to Reed Hundt from Attorney General Reno
        asking him to act.  Dudgeon's call has a very urgent tone and he is
        concerned that the AG's letter to Hundt is the WH's answer to their letter
        to POTUS.  We need to talk about this asap ... please call me at 62682.
