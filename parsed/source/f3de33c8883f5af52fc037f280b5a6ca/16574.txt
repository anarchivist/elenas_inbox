TEXT:
I've told scheduling that the meeting with POTUS on the tobacco review
needs to take place before vacation, so it should happen next week.   (Let
me know if that is wrong and it can wait until after vacation.)  Also,
does Shalala need to be there? Is there anyone else's schedule I should
check before confirming the date of this meeting?
