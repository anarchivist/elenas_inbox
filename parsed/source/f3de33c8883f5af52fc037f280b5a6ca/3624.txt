                         DATE:             July 25, 1997
                         LOCATION:         Gateway Marriott, Crystal City, VA
                         BRIEFING TIME: 9:45 am - 10:15 am
                         EVENT TIME:       10:30 am - 11 :55 am
                     FROM:          Bruce Reed


I.    PURPOSE

      To announce fifteen new cities that are supporting your proposal for national standards in
      education.

II.   BACKGROUND

      You will be making remarks before the National Association of Elementary School
             Principals (NAESP) at their annual convention. The Executive Director of
      NAESP, Sam Sava will be presenting you with the Distinguished Leadership in
      Education Award. Past recipients of this award have been Secretary Riley, George Bush,
      Bill Bennett and Stephen Bickel, CEO of VALIC a corporate partner.

      The NAESP consists of school leaders in every state, the District of Columbia, and
      American schools overseas. Approximately 450 principals will be in attendance, and the
      NAESP will distribute a copy your remarks to all 30,000 elementary and middle school
      principals across the country. You have been invited to address this group every year of
      your presidency, but have not been able to attend. The First Lady met with this group
      last year.

      You will be announcing the support of Atlanta, Broward County (Ft. Lauderdale),
      Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, El Paso, Fresno, Houston, Long Beach, Los Angeles, New
      York City, Omaha, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and Seattle for national standards.

      In each of these cities, a partnership including the superintendent, school board and
              teachers' union has endorsed the school system's participation. In almost all
      cases, especially where the mayor plays a major role in education, (e.g., Chicago and
      Philadelphia) the mayor is fully informed and supportive.

                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

                 Despite their participation in the testing initiative, the superintendents have also
                 expressed particular concern about our decision to limit the 4th grade reading test to
                 English only_ Almost every city has a large Hispanic population, and all of them test
                 Limited Proficient English students in their native language. As we have with Hispanic
                 groups such as MALDEF, we have told the superintendents that we will work to explore
                 ways to address their concerns, without committing to changing our position.

                 Mike Cohen along with the Department of Education and the National Science
                 Foundation staff will meet later in the day with the urban educators to discuss this issue,
                 as well as other ways in which the federal government can assist the cities in preparing
                 students to meet the national standards in reading and math.
