     DRAFT; 2/26/98, 6 PM
     Remarks by Vice President Al Gore
     Tobacco Advertising Campaign
     Friday, February 27, 1998

              Thank you, Jessica -- for that introduction, and for all you do to
     help us protect other young people from the dangers of cigarettes and
     tobacco.

             We are here today to talk about how far we have come in our battle
     against teen smoking -- and how far we still need to go to protect our
     children from the number-one preventable cause of death in this country.
     An astonishing 25% of all 17 and 18 year olds in America smoke
     cigarettes. We see more and more evidence that the tobacco industry has
     systematically marketed their products to young people and minorities.
     Each and every day, 3,000 kids are captured by tobacco addiction -- and
     1,000 lose their lives. ThatD,s why we donD,t have a single day to
     waste. We need bipartisan, comprehensive legislation that dramatically
     reduces teen smoking, and changes the way tobacco companies do business


fo.rever -- and we need it no.w .

           .ID,m pro.ud to. say that, in the meantime, President Clinto.n and I
havenD,t just been waiting -- weD,ve been wo.rking, to. make a difference.
To.mo.rro.w marks the first anniversary o.f the enactment o.f the to.ughest-ever
measures to. cut-o.ff childrenD,s access to tobacco. One year ago, we made
it a crime to. sell tobacco. to minors, and we required vendors who. sell
cigarettes to. ask for a pho.to. 1.0. fro.m anyo.ne whoD,s yo.unger than 27.

          No.w we are taking the next step, to. make sure tho.se new rules are
fo.llo.wed.   I am pleased to. anno.unce that, starting this weekend, we are
launching a $7.5 millio.n natio.nal advertising campaign to. educate
retailers, clerks, and custo.mers abo.ut the ban o.n teen smo.king and the
fines retailers face if they donD,t help us enfo.rce it. As o.ne o.f the
signs says, D&We card because we care.DS With these millions of dollars
in new print and billbo.ard ads, in-store materials, and radio. spo.ts, we
will stop retailers from selling cigarettes to o.ur children -- and we will
save untold tho.usands of yo.ung lives.

        The campaign starts this weekend in Arkansas.   This spring it will
expand to ten other states around the natio.n, and we expect that it will
reach alISO states by yearD,s end.

          I am also here to. say that o.ur new efforts to reduce teen smo.king
do no.t stand alone. They are part o.f a co.mprehensive strategy to. crack
do.wn o.n tho.se who. peddle illegal to.bacco. pro.ducts to. o.ur children. We are
ho.lding the states acco.untable, and thanks to. citizens like Jessica, we
are checking to. make sure that all states meet high standards in keeping
tobacco away fro.m kids. And weD,re doing all of this because o.f the
leadership o.f a friend o.f mine -- the late Co.ngressman fro.m Oklaho.ma, Mike
Synar. Mike fo.ught hard to. pro.tect o.ur children fro.m to.bacco. pro.ducts
lo.ng befo.re it was the po.pular thing to. do. -- because he knew it was th~
right thing to. do..

          Mike isnD,t with us to celebrate our pro.gress.     But I know that he
is lo.o.king do.wn o.n us pro.udly to.day. Because to.day, I am anno.uncing that
fo.ur states -- Flo.rida, Maine, New Hampshire, and Washingto.n -- have
already met the go.al he set o.f lo.wering cigarette sales to. mino.rs to. less
than 20 percent. And three mo.re states are clo.se to. meeting that go.al.
We are submitting these figures to. Co.ngress as part o.f o.ur annual Synar
repo.rt o.n state co.mpliance with teen smo.king restrictio.ns -- and we are
including deadlines fo.r all o.ther states to. meet the 20 percent go.al.

         The ad campaign we are unveiling to.day will help us meet tho.se
goals. We need to cut o.ff childrenD,s access to. to.bacco        and we need to.
make the sto.re co.unters o.ur fro.ntlines in this battle. It is the sto.re
co.unter where to.o. much teen smo.king starts -- and to.gether, we must make
sure it is where the pro.blem sto.ps. Waiting in line a few mo.ments lo.nger
while sto.re clerks check a young personD,s pho.to. I.D.D,s might be a small
hassle fo.r a natio.n thatD,s always on the mo.ve -- but it will make a big
difference in pro.tecting o.ur children fro.m o.ne o.f the greatest threats to.
their health. With this new campaign, and o.ur call fo.r bipartisan,
co.mprehensive anti-to.bacco. legislatio.n, we can give o.ur yo.ung peo.ple a
healthier, smo.ke-free to.mo.rro.w -- and it canD,t come a day to.o so.o.n.
