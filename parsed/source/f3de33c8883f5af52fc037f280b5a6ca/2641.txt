TEXT:
Bob Chase is the President of the NEA -- he took over sometime in the past
6 months or so, and has been making something of a big splash as a new
reform leader, trying to get the NEA on the right side of the issues.
POTUS met with him for the first time on Thursday.  John and Craig Smith
were in the meeting; I was not. Craig and I had been talking for some time
about the need for the meeting, and what POTUS ought to raise in it.

POTUS was to ask Bob for two things -- support for the budget, and support
for the tests:  I haven't heard how the meeting went, though I saw Bob in
the reception area just before the meeting. He told me he wanted to talk
about the tests -- NEA has almost never met a test it likes, and never
liked using tests for accountability. Bob wants to move the NEA to a more
supportive stance for us, and wants to talk about how to do that.  I
assume he told the President something along those lines, though I have
not yet heard back from Craig.

I'll be sure to keep you and Bruce in the loop as soon as I find anything
out.
