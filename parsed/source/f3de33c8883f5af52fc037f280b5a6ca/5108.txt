TEXT:
We need your calIon whether to cave on one of the TANF reg issues.
(Elena, it's "6b.") Bruce, you had earlier expressed not much interest in
it, but we have a somewhat crisper understanding of it than we once did,
so I want to make sure we have our marching orders.

HHS's draft rightly requires states to include both TANF and state-only
programs in its case load reduction credit calculation.  However, we have
been pushing them to drop language that invites states to exclude from the
CRC calculation some or .all families in a state-only program "based on the
nature of benefits provided."

What HHS is trying to do here is to encourage states to set up programs
that support the working poor through state EITC's, or child care or
transportation subsidies WITHOUT making them subject to time limits. HHS
is worried that states will be discouraged from doing so because any new
people added will give them a smaller caseload reduction credit.

I have not been that sympathetic, because states have two pretty good
alternatives.   They can either classify these as TANF benefits,
especially since these folks are actually working, which makes people
subject to time limits. Or they can do this in a state-only program free
from time limits, and accept a smaller caseload reduction credit. On the
other hand, this is a complex issue to elevate .. What do you think?
