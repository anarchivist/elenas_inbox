 Waxman's office would like to sit down with CDC, Treasury, and DOJ.
 Treasury and DOJ they have no bill-writing agenda with -- they have
 questions on immunity (what is the incentive for a company to contest a
 lawsuit under the legislation they lose the money either way) and Treasury
 they just want to meet.  They are planning on re-writing performance      -
 standard legislation and want to talk to CDC about performance and
 technical surveys. They'd like to talk to CDC Friday.
