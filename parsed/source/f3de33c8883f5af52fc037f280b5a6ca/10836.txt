TEXT:
Medicare Commission Plan Released.  Thursday night, Senator Breaux sent
out a press release announcing that the Commission would meet on Tuesday,
January 26, and that he would release a plan in advance of it.   We got a
copy of that plan on Thursday night. Among other things, it includes a
premium support plan that allows for differential benefits; raises the age
eligibility for Medicare along with "a proposal to allow seniors with
delayed eligibility to participate in Medicare, with exact details to be
developed;" and a new Medicare Board to replace most of HCFAD,s
functions.  Adding a prescription drug benefit is included in a section
entitled "areas that need to be resolved," with a statement that
"Democrats are exploring ways to include an affordable drug benefit in
MedicareD,s fee-for-service program." We are developing a set of qs and
as, since reporters are already calling, and since Secretary Shalala is
briefing the White House Press after FridayD,s bioterrorism event.
