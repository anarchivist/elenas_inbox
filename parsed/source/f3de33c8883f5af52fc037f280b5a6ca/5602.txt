          WASHINGTON (AP)   Spending per student in U.S. schools leveled
      off in the 1990s, but the share of school budgets going to special
      education programs grew, a private report said today.
          "People say that we've been throwing money at schools and not
      getting results, " said Lawrence Mishel, research director for the
      nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, which released the study.
      "Well, we certainly haven't been throwing money at schools in the
      1990s.' ,
          While total school budgets have grown because of an 8.4 percent
      increase in enrollment from 1991 to 1996, inflation adjusted
      statistics from the Education Department show that the money spent


 on each student has grown just 0.7 percent during those five years,
 according to EPI.
     That's a significant slowdown from 1.7 percent average annual
 growth during the previous 30 years, the institute said.
     In 1996, inflation adjusted spending on each student in public
 elementary and secondary schools was $6,576, up just $47 from
 $6,529 in 1991.
     How schools spend their money is changing, however.
     Looking at nine representative school districts across the
 country, EPI researchers found that the portion of their budgets
 going to special education was up to 19 percent in 1996, from 17.8
 percent in 1991.
     Special education costs included instructors, materiaTs and the
 administration of programs to help learning-disabled children and
 those with handicaps, as well as structural modifications and
 transportation to make schools handicap accessible.
     Bilingual education programs also are taking a greater share of
 school budgets, accounting for 2.5 percent in 1996, up from 1.9
 percent in 1991.
     And school lunch and breakfast programs accounted for 4.8
 percent of total school spending in 1996, up from 3.3 percent in
 1991.
     The percentage of school budgets spent on regular education,
 meanwhile, was down in 1996 to 56.8 percent from 58.5 percent in
 1991.
     In three of the nine school districts examined    Anne Arundel
 county, Md., East Baton Rouge, La., and Middletown, N.Y.
 inflation adjusted dollars spent per student on regular education
 actually dropped from 1991 to 1996, while special-ed spending per
 pupil went up.
     In Los Angeles, regular and special education spending per
 student both dropped while spending per pupil on bilingual
 education rose.
     Per-student spending on regular education was up in Bettendorf,
 Iowa, Boulder, ,Colo., Claiborne County, Tenn., Fall River, Mass.,
 and Spring Branch, Texas.
     One reason for spending shifts may'be the increase in federal
 rules requiring schools to accommodate special-needs students,
 Mishel said.
     "There are kids who are autistic or with other problems that in
 earlier times may not have been in the school system,"   Mishel
 said. "There's legal obligations to provide special education, but
 there's no legal obligation to improve regular education:"
     But Mishel said researchers did not ask school districts where
 special-ed money would have gone otherwise.
     " I think we can't draw strong conclusions that if the money
 hadn't gone to special education it would have gone to regular
 education, " he said.
     The EPI study also found that on average for the nine school
 districts examined, per-student spending on after-school athletics
 has dropped 7 percent in the '90s, spending on security and
 violence prevention dropped 15.2 percent and spending per pupil on
 desegregation was down 32.9 percent.
     On average,' per-student spending on health and psychological
 services was up 87.3 percent, and for vocational education, up 52.7
 percent.
