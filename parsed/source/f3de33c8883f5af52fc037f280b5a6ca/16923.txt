Education Weekly

1. National Tests: The Senate adopted our proposal to put NAGB in charge of the tests by a
strong bipartisan vote of 88-12. The amendment to the appropriations bill also included some
modifications to NAGB's membership, and gives it greater independence from the Education
Department. The House vote has been put off until next Tuesday or Wednesday. We continue
to face solid opposition from Republicans and from the Congressional Black and Hispanic
Caucuses.

Secretary Riley has sent a detailed letter to the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, providing
the most detailed, specific and, we believe, satisfying responses to issues they and members of
both Caucuses have raised about the tests. While we do not expect this letter to change any
votes in either Caucus, we believe it can help create a better climate for our continued efforts to
find a basis on which we can ultimately win their support.

2. Senate Vote to create Education Block Grant: Shortly after voting to support your testing
proposal, the Senate voted by a 51-49 margin to combine almost all elementary and secondary
education programs into a block grant that would be distributed directly to local school districts.
Among the long list of programs effectively eliminated by this provision are Goals 2000, Charter
Schools, Technology Challenge Grants, Eisenhower Professional Develepment program, and
Safe and Drug Free Schools. Title 1 is also turned into a block grant, by eliminating any
requirements on the use of the funds. Secretary Riley has already indicated that this provision is
unacceptable, and we are working with other White House offices to determine the level of veto
threat most appropriate to issue.
