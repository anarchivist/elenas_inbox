TEXT:
OMB has been floating an alternative to limit the amount a state can
transfer to 4.25% of their TANF block grant beginning in FY 1999. Given
the wide variation in state decisions to transfer in FY 1998, a somewhat
better alternative might be to give states the option of transferring the
higher of what they did in FY 1998 or 4.25%.   Some states have
transferred considerably more than 4.25%, some have not yet transferred
anything in FY 1998 but might want to in FY 1999. We'd like to discuss
other alternatives with OMB and HHS, assuming we have time to come up w/
an alternative--when do you need this?

Background
The welfare reform law, as amended by BBA, said states could transfer up
to 30% of their TANF block grant to child care, including up to 10% for
SSBG. TEA-21 reduced the SSBG transfer to 4.25% beginning in 2000; OMB's
possible alternative is to impose this same limit beginning in FY 1999.

Do we have any compromise ideas/fallback positions?

Here's section from SAP on the limitation on TANF transfer.   It's
definitely a bad thing.

"Social Services Block Grant. The Administration opposes a provision that
would
           restrict State authority to transfer Temporary Assistance to
Needy Families
           (TANF) funds to SSBG in FY 1999 to no more than the amounts
transferred by
           individual States in FY 1998. Enacting such a provision so late
in FY 1998 would
           inequitably limit State flexibility for the future. "

I'm still checking on the WTW obligation period.
