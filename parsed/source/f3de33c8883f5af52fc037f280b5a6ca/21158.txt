Little-Known Subsidy
"Complements" Guaranty Agencies

The Federal Family Education Loan program includes provisions   under which
guaranty agencies ostensibly bear a small portion of the cost   of each
defaulted loan. A little-known payment called the collection    complement,
however, effectively repays guaranty agencies for their share   of default
costs. HereD,s how it works:

          A loan with a balance of $1,000 (outstanding principal and
accrued interest) defaults.

         The lender submits a claim to their guaranty agency and is paid
$980, or 98 percent of the principal and accrued interest. The guaranty
agency then submits a reinsurance claim to the Department of Education and
is paid $960, or 98 percent of the amount paid to the lender.   (Under the
House and Senate HEA Reauthorization bills, this amount would be reduced
to 95 percent beginning October 1, 1998.)   Thus, the agency temporarily
loses 2 percent of the amount it paid the lender.   (We should note that
agencies generally pay lenders from their reserve funds, which are Federal
property, so even this temporary loss is underwritten fully by the
government. )

         Guaranty agencies then collect on the loan:

                        Agencies are required to charge a fee of up to
18.5 percent to cover their collection costs; this fee is added to the
default balance owed by the borrower. The Department of Education and
many efficient guaranty agencies have collection costs below this level.

                        Agencies are allowed by statute to retain 27
percent of all collections to cover their costs, even though students only
are charged a maximum of 18.5 percent.

                        Agencies may retain an additional 2 percent,
called the collection complement, to compensate the agency for the 2
percent risk-sharing deducted from their reinsurance payment from the
Department.
        ~RMS Email System                                                             Page 5 of 5



                                Thus, if an agency collects $100 a month on the
        $1,000 loan discussed above, each monthly payment would be allocated as
        follows:


                Allocation of Payments
                in Borrower Account     Allocation of Cash Between Agency and Department
                $18.50 applied to collection fee         $27 to guaranty agency for   collect
        retention
                $81.50 applied to principal and interest         $71 to Department to cover
        principal and interest
                        $2 complement to guaranty agency for recovery of risk-sharing paymen

         As the table shows, for each $100 the guaranty agency collects on the
        defaulted loan, it retains $27, or 27 percent, plus a $2 complement, for a
        total of $29 dollars.  The balance of the collection--$71--goes to the
        Department.

          -- The agency continues to retain the 2 percent complement even after
        the initial risk-sharing has been fully offset,  For example, on the
        $1,000 loan discussed above, the agency risk-sharing totaled $20
        ($980-$960=$20). Deducting $2 from each of the first 10 $100 monthly
        repayments would recoup this $20 "loss"--agencies, however, can continue
        to retain the 2 percent complement on all subsequent repayments,
        effectively making money on the defaulted loan at the taxpayerO,s expense.

          Both the House and Senate reauthorization bills reduce the amount
        agencies may retain to 24 percent from 27 percent.

          -- Under these bills, the agency would retain $24 of every $100
        collected, plus a $5 complement.   (The complement increase corresponds
        with the increased risk-sharing discussed above,)   As a result, the agency
        would retain a total of $29, the same amount as under current law.

        Under either current law or the House or Senate reauthorization proposals,
        guaranty agency risk-sharing is thoroughly undermined by the complement.
        Eliminating this provision would create a true incentive for agencies to
        prevent defaults, while producing five-year savings of $138 million at 98
        percent reinsurance and $347 million at 95 percent reinsurance under OMB
        scoring.
