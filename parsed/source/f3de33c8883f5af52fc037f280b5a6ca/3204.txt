TEXT:
Michael Waldman has turned over to us the task of identifying pending
regulations that could be the basis of events.  This is your chance to
plug pediatric labeling ...

I think all we have to do is write down whatever's pending (child
care/immuniz, pediatric, anything else?) and send an e-mail to Ann, SMAT,
Podesta, and Michael.
