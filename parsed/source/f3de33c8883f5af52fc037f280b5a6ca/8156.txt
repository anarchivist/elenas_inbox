TEXT:
Attached is one file with two draft letters:  the first is for NGA on no
further amendments, the second is for Kerry on Gramm.  Chris spoke with
NGA and they think that if the Gramm reference is in their letter, they
cannot use it and it would do more harm than good.

Josh, we are hoping that it is possible that these, letters could be sent
out Monday morning.  Please page Chris or myself with any questions or
changes.

Thanks.==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ====================

                                          June 15, 1998


Senators Lott and Daschle

I am writing to infonn you of our strong opposition to further amendments to the McCain bill
that undennine the structure or uses of the State Litigation Settlement Account that was included
in the manager's amendment. We believe that additional changes to this carefully constructed
agreement would harm the goal of passing historic comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco legislation.

This legislation would not have been possible without the leadership of the States. States have
earned and deserve recognition of their efforts through protection against amendments that
further reduce the amount that States receive in their Account. We also oppose additional
amendments that alter the parameters for or uses of the restricted funds.

Holding the line on additional changes to the State Litigation Settlement Account is necessary to
assure that the McCain bill represents a fair balance between flexibility and accountability, and
protects the States from further funding reductions. As always, we look forward to working
with you on this extremely important legislation.


[Jack]

    Senator Kerry

    You requested our position on Senator Gramm's amendment to the tobacco legislation that
    would delete any restrictions on funds in the State Litigation Settlement Account. We strongly
    oppose this amendment.

    Our position on this amendment is consistent with our position on all amendments to the State
    Litigation Settlement Account. We oppose all additional amendments that alter the parameters
    for or uses ofthe restricted funds. We believe that additional changes to this carefully
    constructed agreement would harm the goal of passing historic comprehensive, bipartisan
    tobacco legislation.

    We thank you for your continuing support for passing comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco
    legislation.

    (Jack]
