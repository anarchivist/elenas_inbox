MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT


FROM:         Bruce Reed and Neal Lane

SUBJECT:      Attached letter



Attached is a letter to Dr. Harold Shapiro, the Chair of your Bioethics Advisory Commission,
requesting that the Commission consider the ethical issues raised by a recent experiment
involving the creation of an embryonic cell that is part human and part cow. The letter also asks
the Commission to review issues related to other kinds of cutting edge stem cell research that
have significant medical potential.

The letter is designed to make clear your serious ethical concerns about experiments that mingle
human and non-human species. At the same time, the letter is intended to distinguish this very
troubling research from other stem cell research, involving purely human material, that may have
significant medical benefits.

We would like to get this letter to Dr. Shapiro in time for the Commission's next meeting, which
will take place in Miami on Tuesday. If you approve, we will leak the letter to the New York
Times for this Sunday's edition.

Dr. Harold Shapiro
Chair, National Bioethics Advisory Commission
Suite 3COI
6100 Executive Boulevard
Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7508

Dear Dr. Shapiro:

This past week's report ofthe creation of an embryonic stem cell that is part human and part cow
raises the most serious ethical, medical, and legal concerns. I am deeply troubled by this news
of experiments involving the mingling of human and non-human species. I am therefore
requesting the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to consider the implications of such
research at its meeting next week, and to report back to me immediately thereafter.

I recognize, however, that other kinds of stem cell research raise different ethical issues, while
promising significant medical benefits. Four years ago, I issued a ban on the use of federal
funds to create human embryos solely for research purposes; the ban was later broadened by
Congress to prohibit any embryo research in the public sector. At that time, the benefits of
human stem cell research were hypothetical, while the ethical concerns were immediate.
Although the ethical issues have not diminished, it now appears that this research may have real
potential for treating such devastating illnesses as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's
disease. With this in mind, I am also requesting the Commission to undertake a thorough
review of the issues associated with such human stem cell research, balancing all ethical and
medical considerations.

I look forward to receiving your reports on these important issues.

                                             Sincerely,




                                                           Automated Records Management System
