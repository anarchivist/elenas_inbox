I. National Initiative/Referendum

          Referenda allow the people to pass judgement on laws passed by their representatives, while initiatives
allow the people to originate legislative proposals. Some initiatives ("direct") translate the public will into binding
legislation, while others ("indirect") create agenda items to which bodies can respond.

           Today, important questions at the state level are routinely submitted to direct judgement of the people. In
49 states, voters must approve changes in state constitutions. 21 states have statutory initiatives; 18 states have
constitutional initiatives; 25 states have popular referenda. In addition, state legislatures often put legislative referenda
on the ballot, and governors often put initiatives to circumvent legislative obstacles. There has been a surge in the
use of these devices at the state level since the mid-1970s, past the previous peak registered in the early years of this
century to a new record high. While the evidence is mixed on the effect of referenda and initiatives on stimulating
voters to turn out, these forms of public participation are seen by the people as increasing legitimacy of public
institutions and the policy outcomes that flow from them.

          In the past, we have recommended the President endorse a constitutional amendment that would permit
both referenda and indirect initiatives but not direct initiatives. Referenda would give the people a chance to nullifY,
by a vote of 60 percent, legislation already passed by the House and Senate and signed by the President. Indirect
initiatives would give the people a chance to craft specific legislative language which, once approved by a 60 percent
majority, would have to receive up or down consideration by the U.S. Congress within 90 days. This proposal bears
only on legislation; it leaves untouched existing mechanisms for and proposing and passing constitutional
amendments

         A more detailed white paper is available on this proposal.

2. Two-Day Voting

          In United We Stand, Ross Perot proposed that Federal elections to be held over two days -- Saturday and
Sunday -- so that working people could get to the polls more easily. A problem with holding the vote over the
weekend however is that it may offend the religious community. Another option would be to make election day a
holiday. However, since we are already have too many holidays, we could consider placing the election on an
existing holiday. July 4th makes the most sense. Other options include Veterans Day or Columbus Day.

3. Eliminate the Electoral College

         Over the past two centuries, political, constitutional, and social changes have combined to move our system
toward more direct public participation. The rise of the party system all but eliminated electors' freedom of action in
seleoing presidents. Early in this century, a constitutional amendment yielded the direct eleoion of U.S. senators.

         The Electoral College no long serves any purpose, except for the possibility of denying the office to the
people's choice for President. The American public should be able to vote directly for their President and Vice
President, and majority vote should be the rule. This would however, require a Constitutional Amendment.

4. Reform the Federal Election Commission

          There is strong academic agreement that the Federal Election Commission needs reform. In its current form
it is paper tiger without real teeth. Currently, there are six member of the committee that the President appoints.
Three Republicans and three Democrats. One proposal would be to add one independent member and give the
agency criminal prosecution powers to enforce the election laws. A more modest reform proposal would be to
exclude former national and state party officials (congressional campaign committees included) from serving on the
Commission.

                                                                                                       rds Management System
                                                                                       A\ltomate~~;_~i1mp Corwersion

          The President's position on this is clear and we have a developed strategy. One issue that is not yet
resolved, however, is the timing regarding the President's petition to the Federal Election Commission to ban "Soft
Money." The petition is ready to be sent, however, Senator McCain has expressed some reservations regarding
timing because of concerns that the President's petition will appear to be partisan grandstanding since Republicans
raise twice as much "Soft Money" as Democrats.

6. Foreign Lobbying

         Issue an Executive Order that would ban all executive branch officials from contact with registered
agents of foreign governments when the contact is for the purpose of influencing the U.S. government on
behalf of foreign governments. The order would include corporations that are either wholly-owned or
majority-owned by foreign governments. The definition of registered agents of foreign governments would
largely track the definition of agency in the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), although it would be
limited to foreign governments, while FARA covers agents of all foreign "principals." The proposal would
include exceptions for lawyers engaged in litigation or administrative proceedings.

        Alternative options include: 1) maintaining a public record of lobbyists who contact any government
agency on behalf of foreign entities; 2) Fully enforce FARA.

7. Ban Foreign Lobbyists Contributions to National Campaigns

         Although U.S. law prohibits foreign entities from contributing to U.S. campaigns, lawyers and
lobbyists for foreign entities are not restricted from raising and distributing funds to candidates. In order to
reduce the possible influencing of Federal elections by foreign governments, the President could endorse a
ban on contributions to any candidate for Federal election who is a registered foreign lobbyist as defined
under FARA. The President could propose that a ban be included in the final, bipartisan campaign finance
reform. In addition, the President could challenge all Democrats to stop accepting such contributions
immediately.
