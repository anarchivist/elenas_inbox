TEXT:
Mike Smith wanted us to be aware (especially with all that's been going on
with vouchers, etc). that on Tuesday the FLOTUS is scheduled to announce
that DC will be getting $45 million from the sale of Sallie Mae. The
money can be spent for facilities construction/repair or for certain
school reform activities.   Evidently this is considerably more money than
anyone had expected, because Sallie Mae's stock price has gone way up.    I
didn't get to talk to Mike C. about this before he left, but I wonder wheth
er this announcement should be a candidate for a POTUS event? On the one
hand, it somewhat undermines the message that there isn't enough $ for DC
schools so we can't afford to have a voucher plan draining funds away.
But on the positive side, it would be a chance to say here's what we ought
to be doing: investing in needed improvements--like replacing (not just
patching) leaky roofs, not turning our backs on our schools, etc.

Also, ED indicates that in all likelihood there will be as many as 20 new
charter schools opening in DC in fall 98.  Both DC chartering authorities
are up and running, are getting lots of applications, and seem to be doing
their jobs well.

I will be getting somewhat more detailed info on all of this.
