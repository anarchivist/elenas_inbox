TEXT:
I just spoke with Earl G. from DOL.   He had what he described as a "good
conversation" with Coverdell's staffer, who continued to press him not to
hold the first meeting of the bi-partisan working group until after the
recess. According to Coverdell's staffer, Wyden's staff has been telling
him that they also do not want this process to start until after the
recess.   I told Earl that the meeting was going to take place this
afternoon, with or without Coverdell. Also, that it is no surprise that
Wyden's staff has been pressing to postpone this meeting. We have known
all along that Wyden does not want our process to be credible. Without
it, he can better persuade Dems. that his bill is the only way to reform
the program.
