TEXT:
This was Maria's meeting which centered mostly on ways the outreach
offices could help advance Administration positions on appropriations
bills. Eventually, it was decided that various offices (OMB, CEQ, DPC)
would put together cheat sheets of what is in bills that OPL could use to
reach out to groups such as women, minorities, gays. DPC was asked to do
a list on education and community development.   I'd checked before the
meeting with Mike, Andrea, Leane, Sarah and Julie F. and had the issues
they considered important included in other peoples lists (e.g. OMB is
doing race) which we can double check next week.   The issues DPC folks
wanted included were race and health, brady, juvy prevention, EEOC,
national testing, Goals 2000, and WTW housing vouchers.   Tobacco money and
America Reads also came up.
