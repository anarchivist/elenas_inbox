Subject: S~nator Torricelli Offers Family Leave Benefits to Gay Staff, F

Senator applies leave law to gay staffers
March ~2, ~997

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., has extended benefits of
the family-leave law to gay members of his staff.

A homosexual-rights group said other lawmakers have done it informally, but
that the freshman senator is the first to write it into his office policy.

It means that a gay staffer could get unpaid leave to care for a companion
in
a medical emergency.

The   ~993
         Family and Medical Leave Act requires companies with 50 or more
emp~oyees to offer ~2 weeks of unpaid leave within a ~2-month period for
family emergencies.

But Torricelli told The Hill newspaper, "This is making the laws of
Congress
consistent with a new and rising national standard of equality . . . . Rather
than being the last institution to rise to this new standard, Congress
should
be a part of the change."

Torricelli has a staff of 43. The benefit has been added to his office
personnel manual.

"My general sense is that many offices in the House and Senate do offer
this
benefit to employees in an informal manner, " said David Smith, spokesman
for
the Human Rights Campaign. "Senator Torricelli has gone the extra step and
placed that policy in writing. ' ,

Torricelli spokesman Jim Jordan said this does not make companions of gay


staffers eligible for any health benefits in their own right. "It's for
sickness, bereavement·," he said.'

A conservative group criticized Torricelli's gesture.

"This was a law developed for the purpose of ensuring that people can care
for 'their families," said KristiHamrick, spokeswoman for the Family
Research Council. "It's inappropriate for a senator to cheapen the meaning
of
family by saying family is a -fill in the blank.'"

     Benefits for gay partners appvd by Chi.

     CHICAGO, March 12 (UPI)    A key Chicago City Council committee has voted to
     extend government employee health benefits to the domestic partners of
     homosexual city employees.

     The city's Finance Committee Wednesday voted 15-7 in favor of the proposal

     which was favored by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley _ after three hours of
     debate and despite loud protests from anti-abortion and fundamentalist
     religious groups.

     Daley had steadfastedly stood behind the proposal despite criticism based
     not
     only on moral and religious grounds, but from aldermen and others who
     believed it was unfair to extend benefits to gay domestic partners but not
     to
     heterosexual domestic partners.

     Passage of the bill by the city's powerful Finance Committee virtually
     assures its approval by the full City Council. The overwhelming votes of
     the
     pro-Daley aldermen on the committee allowed some of the mayor's allies to
     vote against it or to walk away from the controversy.

     And there was plenty of controversy. Protesters spent much of Wednesday
     picketing and chanting outside of City Hall, saying the proposal rewards
     immorality and sanctions the gay lifestyle.

     Some carried signs urging Chicago not to    act like San Francisco. Others
     blasted Daley and claimed the vote would    erode the morals of the city. The
     measure was also opposed by the powerful    Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago,
     which, however, failed to send anyone to    testify against the measure.
