PRESIDENT   WILLIAM J. CLINTON
STATEMENT   ON MEDICARE REFORM
THE WHITE   HOUSE
MARCH 16,   1999

        Good Afternoon.  IO,d like to begin by saying that our thoughts
and prayers are with all those involved in this morningO,s Amtrak train
crash in Illinois.  We have dispatched safety officials from the National
Transportation Safety Board to the site just outside Chicago to lead the
investigation. We will do everything we can to help the victims and their
families and to ensure this investigation moves forward with great care
and speed.

        Before I leave for Florida, I would like to comment on an issue of
vital importance to the future of AmericaO,s families: How to best
strengthen Medicare for the 21st Century.

        Today, Senator Breaux and Rep. Thomas are finishing work on a
Medicare reform plan that responds to many of the challenges facing
Medicare today. After more than a year of work, the Medicare commission
has helped to focus long overdue attention on the need to modernize the
program and prepare it for the retirement of the baby boom generation.  It
has done valuable work, work that we can and must build on to craft
Medicare reform.

        Make no mistake: we must modernize and strengthen Medicare.   For
more than three decades, Medicare has been much more than a program.   It
is the way we honor our parents and grandparents -- and protect our
families.  In my 1993 economic plan that put America on the path of fiscal
responsibility, we took steps to strengthen Medicare.  In 1995, we stopped
a misguided effort to make severe cuts that would have undermined our
commitment. And in the 1997 bipartisan balanced budget agreement, we took
the most significant steps yet -- improving benefits, expanding choices
for recipients, fighting waste, fraud and abuse, and extending the life of
the Trust Fund to at least the year 2010.

        But as the Baby Boomers retire, and medical science extends the
lives of millions of Americans, we must do more -- taking strong and
sometimes difficult steps -- to modernize Medicare so that it can fulfill


its promise into the 21st Century.  If we do not act, Medicare will run
out of funds in 2010. That would represent a broken promise to
generations of Americans. And we cannot allow that to happen.

        As I said in January, we must act, and our actions must be rooted
in fundamental principles. we must seize the opportunity created by our
fiscal discipline, and devote 15% of the budget surplus to strengthen and
stabilize Medicare. We must modernize Medicare, and make it more
competitive, by adopting the best practices from the private sector and
maintaining high quality services. We must ensure that Medicare continues
to provide every citizen a guaranteed set of benefits. And we must make
prescription drugs more accessible and affordable to Medicare recipients.
           The plan offered by Sen. Breaux and his colleagues included
many strong elements. Many of its recommendations represent sound policy
that should be seriously considered by the Congress. However, I believe
their approach falls short in several respects. It would raise the age of
eligibility for Medicare -- from 65 to 67 -- without a policy to guard
against rising numbers of uninsured Americans.    It does not guarantee
that the current level of benefits will be provided to all beneficiaries,
nor does it ensure that premiums for the traditional Medicare program wiil
remain s.table. And it does not provide adequate coverage for prescription
drugs.

        Most fundamentally, it fails to make a solid commitment to
devoting 15 percent of our surplus to the Medicare Trust Fund. Only by
making this commitment can we keep the program on firm financial ground
until the year 2020.

        Every independent expert agrees that Medicare cannot provide for
the baby boom generation without substantial new revenues.  Beyond that,
it is very clear that Medicare reform will require difficult political and
technical choices.  If we really want to reform Medicare, then we should
do whatever we can to make those choices easier. Devoting 15 percent of
the surplus to Medicare would do just that -- it would stabilize the
program -- and give us the space we need to modernize and improve its
services.

        I want to thank the Medicare Commission for their work and for
their recommendations.  While they ultimately did not achieved a consensus
on the commission, the Medicare commissionO,s work must spur us to
action.  Today, I am instructing my advisors to draft a plan to strengthen
Medicare for the 21st Century, which I will present to this Congress. We
will seek to craft a proposal that can achieve even greater consensus.
Medicare is too important to let partisan politics stand in the way of
vital progress.  I believe that if we make difficult choices, work
together, and act this year, we can secure Medicare for the future.  Thank
you.
