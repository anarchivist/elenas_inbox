TEXT:
We've gotten some more info about the Giant program (put it under
Christa's door last night). A few changes are worth noting.   Christa will
you revise scheduling memo, or should I?  It still sounds like a great
program.
health benefits do not start after 30 days (unfortunately).  Giant's
policy for all new employees is that full benefits are paid after an
'appropriate waiting period'. We understand that is 15 months.    In the
meantime, program participants are at least covered by medicaid for 12
months after leaving assistance.
top of starting pay range is $8.14 rather than $8.75.  This is the union
wage scale.
once hired, each participant is teamed with an existing employee who
serves as a mentor.
the UFCW is fully supportive of the program--in fact, the union actually
developed the idea and presented it to the state.
