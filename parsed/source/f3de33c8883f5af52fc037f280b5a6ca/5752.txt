TEXT:
The report on the good manufacturing practices and good agricultural
practices is due January 2.   Wendy Taylor from OMB called and said that
they would like an extension of a week in order to properly analyze it.
They have some concerns and since many people will be out of the office
for the holidays, they would like a little extra time.  I think it would
be fine, what do you think? Mary
