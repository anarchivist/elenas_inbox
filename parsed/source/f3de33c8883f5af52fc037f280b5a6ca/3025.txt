                   REGARDING SECURITIES LITIGATION LEGISLATION·

Background

At the urging ofa number of Silicon Valley companies, Congresswoman Anna Eshoo has
introduced legislation to preempt private securities fraud class actions brought under state law.
Only "nationally marketed" securities would be covered by this preemption measure.

You likely will be asked whether you have decided whether the Administration will support the
Eshoo bill. An interagency group has been meeting under the auspices of the NEC and
Counsel's Office to develop a recommendation to you. The group is reviewing the evidence and
studies on national uniform standards; there is weight on both sides. Among the recent studies
is a report from the SEC, which you requested, that concludes that it is premature to consider
further federal legislation on securities litigation.

The interagency group is considering not only the option of taking a position for or against the
bill, but also intermediate options, short of supporting the bill, that could stake out a position in
favor of some preemption to achieve some measure of uniformity among the states in litigation
standards. But the bill is not moving at the moment; no hearings have been scheduled in the
House yet and no bill has been introduced in the Senate. Thus, there is no urgency in the sense
of legislative scheduling to your announcing a position now.

Suggested Talking Point:

         ·        The issue of national uniform standards for securities fraud class actions is an
                  important issue and we are continuing to look at it carefully as I said we would do
                  in my letter responding to Congressowman Eshoo. We have benefited from your
                  thoughtful input in that process. We are not on a specific timetable to complete
                  the review. We will watch the legislation carefully as the process unfolds.
