TEXT:
Talked to Randy Moss about this.  I think it probably makes sense for you
to talk to him about it, with your lawyer hat on. He also said he thinks
Stacy is preparing something summarizing their views.

The question is whether doing this is reading too much into the part of
the law that says the Secretary can give out food stamps in the public
interest -- especially giving it to a class of people that Congress has
deemed ineligible. This provision was intended to be used in enforcement
situations, he said.
