TEXT:
I think I've addressed this email to all the women who will be joining us
for breakfast at the Vice President's Residence tomorrow morning.  If you
haven't been there before, you just need to show your WH badge, and you
can park on the grounds. Call time is 8:15 a.m. Mrs. Gore will make short
remarks and then depart a little before 9:00.  Following that, Marcia and
Duffy have asked if we could take some questions and listen to the guests,
,.f .,.

who are from outside D.C.  I hope that as many of you as possible can stay
for that part of the morning, and I will make every effort to end the
discussion no later than 9:30.  This does offer the opportunity to talk
about our strong support for international family planning (and the
political pricetag for our support). We look forward to seeing you
tomorrow morning!
