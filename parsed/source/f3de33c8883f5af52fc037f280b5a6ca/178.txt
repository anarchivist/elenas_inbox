July 16, 1996


       Dear Speaker Gingrich:
          Just over a year ago, I shook hands with you
       and publicly affirmed my commitment to reforming
       the nation's campaign finance laws. As the House
       begins to consider campaign finance reform
       legislation, I urge you to follow through on our
       commitment and send me legislation that will
       address the American public's desire for real
       change in our political process, and in so doing
       renew our democracy and strengthen our country.
          Unfortuately, I believe the leading Republican
       campaign finance reform bill, H.R. 3760, by
       Congressman Thomas, falls far short of our
       commitment. This legislation would drive campaign
       financing in the wrong direction.   For example, the
       increased campaign contribution limits in this
       measure will only work to enhance the role of
       wealthy individuals and special interests in
       federal elections.   This will ultimately undermine
       the participation of the average citizen in
       elections and weaken, not strentghen, our political
       system.
         Organized interests already have too much
       power in the halls of government and the Thomas
       legislation would only work to expand that power.
       As an alternative, I urge your support for the
       comprehensive, bipartisan legislation crafted by
       Congresswoman Smith, Congressman Meehan and
       Congressman Shays.   In particular, I approve of
       several reforms such as placing limits on spending,
       curbing PAC and lobbyist influence, discounting the
       cost of broadcast time, and reforming the soft
       money system.
         As we work to reform campaign finance, we must
       do everything in our power to ensure that we open,
       not limit, the political process.   Our goal is to
       take the reins of our democracy away from big
       special interests, from big money, and to return
       them to the hands of those who deserve them --
       ordinary Americans. Real reform is now achievable.
       I urge you to lead the House in passing sensible,
       comprehensive bipartisan campaign finance reform
       legislation and give the American people something
       we can all be proud of.
                         Sincerely,



       The Honorable Newt Gingrich


           The Speaker
           United States House of Representatives
           Washington, D.C.  20515
