H.R. 3248 -- Dollars to the Classroom Act
(Sponsors:  pitts (R), Pennsylvania and 107 others)

The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 3248, as reported by the
Committee on Education and the Workforce.   If the bill were presented to
the President, his senior advisers would reconunend that he veto it.

H.R. 3248 would convert a wide array of Federal education programs that
address national priorities into a single, unfocused, block grant program
providing general aid for education.   The bill would eliminate programs
that focus on our neediest children and schools, and on activities in
which national leadership can playa critical role.    For example, it would
eliminate programs that help States and school districts raise educational
standards and achievement for students, improve the quality of teaching, b
ring the benefits of technology to our Nation's students, and increase the
availability of after-school programs.

Block grants would replace these worthy programs with genera.1 aid for
school operations, which is the responsibility of States and conununities.
In doing so, it diverts attention from national priorities and the need to
hold schools accountable for results.

(Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

This draft position was developed by LRD (Connie Bowers) in consultation
with HRD (Cassell/White) and ED (Riddle).  The Departments of Justice
(Jones) and Interior (Cardinale), and OMB GC (Rettman), BRCD (Brown), OIRA


(Chenok), agree with or do not object to this position.

ONE/LA clearance:

BACKGROUND

Secretary Riley sent a letter to the House Education and Workforce
Committee on June 24, 1998, stating that he would recommend that the
President veto H.R. 3248 if it were presented to him.  His letter noted
that the President stated previously that he would "use his veto power to
prevent this [block grant] approach from becoming law." The letter stated
that the block grant approach in H.R. 3248 would replace the current
emphasis on national priorities (e.g., focusing on the neediest children
and schools) with general aid that would fail to provide focus and
accountability for results.  The Committee reported the bill by a vote of
19-18.


SUMMARY OF H.R. 3248

Title I       Block Grant Provisions

Title I of H.R. 3248 would consolidate funding for 31 currently funded
elementary and secondary education programs into a $2.7 billion program of
block grants to the States. The total FY 1998 appropriations for these
programs is $2.46 billion.  It would also expand the D&Ed-FlexD8 authority
and the authority of schools to operate Elementary and Secondary Educ~tion
Act Title I schoolwide programs. Title I of H.R. 3248 would:

        Require that 95 percent of the funds be directed to school
districts, which would use them for a variety of classroom activities;

        Provide a 100 percent hold harmless for States and school
districts for the formula grant programs to be consolidated, so that no
State would experience a reduction in funds received;

        Require that funds under the bill supplement, not supplant,
existing State and local educational funds;

        Require States to develop formulas for distributing funds to
school districts in each State.  In developing these formulas, States
would be required to: (1) take into account children living in poverty and
rural areas and children who have a higher than average cost to educate,
and (3) ensure an equitable geographic distribution of funds;.

        Require States to report annually on how funds have been used
to improve student performance and to certify that 95 percent of funds
have been spent on classroom activities and services;

           Allow any ESEA Title I school to be designated as a schoolwide
program.

        Authorize the appropriation of $2.74 billion for FY 1999 and a
total of $14.35 billion for Fiscal Years 1999-2003.

Title II       Ed-Flex Provisions

Title II of H.R. 3248 would expand the existing Ed-Flex demonstration
program to all 50 States. This would allow any State to waive certain
Federal requirements in order to carry out State education reform
..
     efforts.

     PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORING

     According to HRD (Cassell) and BASD ( ), H.R. 3248 is not subject to the
     pay-as you-go (PAYGO) provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
     of 1990.
