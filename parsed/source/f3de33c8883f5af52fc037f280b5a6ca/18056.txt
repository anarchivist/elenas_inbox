TEXT:
I am faxing you a more recent draft of the NSC drafter letter from John
Hilley to Lamar Smith. This is written in response to a letter Smith sent
Hilley reo Haitians.  Scott Busby has not yet vetted it in his office, but
hopes to get that done and the letter out (to Hilley's office) by
tomorrow.  He has also sent it to Maria, Rob Weiner and the DAG's office
at DOJ for comments.  I think that this draft is o.k. -- much better than
the last which I sent you a few days ago.  Just let me know if you have
any comments or concerns. Thanks.

Also, is there any necessary follow-up on yesterday's meeting with DOJ?

Finally, do you need any more information reo INS reform before your
meeting with Doris et al on Wednesday?

Thanks.

Julie
