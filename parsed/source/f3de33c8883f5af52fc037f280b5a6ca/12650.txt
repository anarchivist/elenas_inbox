The Honorable Cass Ballenger
Chairman
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chainnan Ballenger:

I am writing to inform you of the views of the Department of Labor regarding three bills the
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections may mark up this week: H.R. 987, the "Workplace
Preservation Act," H.R. 1439, the "Safety and Health Audit Promotion and Whistleblower
Improvement Act of 1999," and H.R. 1459, the "Models of Safety and Health Excellence Act of
1999."

H.R. 987, "Workplace Preservation Act"

The Department is strongly opposed to H.R. 987, which is intended to delay the issuance of a
protective standard on ergonomics until the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has completed
another study of the scientific literature regarding musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and
ergonomics. Each year, over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-related MSDs.
It is time to act to prevent these injuries and reduce the toll of suffering and the enormous
economic cost they entail. Employers currently spend more than $15-20 billion a year just on
the workers' cOIllpensation associated with MSDs; the total cost of our failure to address
ergonomics is as high as $60 billion.

H.R. 987 would force the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to wait
another 18 months to two years before issuing a standard, allegedly in the expectation that the
conclusions of a new NAS study will be different from those reached by NAS just last year after
a six month study commissioned by Congress and different from the conclusions of an
exhaustive study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in 1997. Both of
those studies concluded that MSDs are caused by physical forces in the workplace and that
ergonomic solutions can reduce those forces and reduce the risk ofMSDs.

Major public health organizations, medical societies and scientific groups, including the
American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the American Public Health
Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons oppose H.R. 987 and urge OSHA to move ahead with a protective standard. After
more than ten years of experience with ergonomic programs in the red meat industry, exhaustive
scientific study, and millions of unnecessary injuries, it is clearly time to move ahead.

I urge the Subcommittee to not act favorably on H. R. 987. IfH.R. 987 were enacted by the
Congress, I would recommend that the President veto the legislation.
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

 H.R. 1439, "Safety and Health Audit Promotion and Whistleblower Improvement Act of 1999"

 A se~ond bill to be marked up is the Chairman's bill, H.R. 1439, which addresses two important,
 but unrelated issues, OSHA's access to and use of employer records in enforcement proceedings
 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act's outdated and inadequate protections against
 retaliation for employees who "blow the whistle" on safety violations or refuse to engage in
 unreasonably dangerous work. Although I appreciate the courtesy you have shown by sharing
 the draft bill with us and in soliciting suggestions for improvement, we cannot support H.R. 1439
 because it does not make adequate changes in the Act's protections for whistleblowers and its
 treatment of employer seif-audits will interfere with the proper enforcement of the OSH Act.

  H.R. 1439 makes three positive changes in section II(c) of the OSH Act, the provision of the Act
. that protects whistleblowers against retaliation: it lengthens the statute of limitations from 30
  days to 60 days; it provides for an administrative remedy in the Occupational Safety and Health
  Review Commission instead of requiring the Secretary to pursue relief for employees in federal
  district court; and it allows the employee to pursue his or her own case if the Department of
  Labor moves too slowly or decides against pursuing the employee's case at all.

 Nevertheless, each of those provisions is not as strong nor as effective as related provisions the
 Administration has forwarded to Congress in the Hazard Reporting Protection Act of 1999. We
 feel strongly that the statute of limitations under section 11 (c) should be 180 days, rather than 60
 days. We believe that Department of Labor's Administrative Law Judges would provide a faster
 and more reliable forum for trying whistleblower cases than the Review Commission, which
 often finds itself without a quorum or with only two members who cannot act to resolve a case,
 and which has no expertise in retaliation and employment discrimination cases. And while H.R.
 1439 allows employees to pursue their own cases, it does not provide for interim relief. a critical
 remedy that can make it possible for employees with no source of income to pursue lengthy
 litigation to vindicate their rights.

 Moreover, it appears that H.R. 1439 eliminates important remedies that are currently available
 under section II(c), the right to recover compensatory and exemplary damages. While
 exemplary damages have rarely been awarded, they provide an important deterrent against
 employer misconduct, and compensatory damages are vital to assuring that whistleblowers who
 have suffered discrimination are made whole. The Administration's Hazard Reporting
 Protection Act of 1999 explicitly provides for compensatory and exemplary damages, and
 provides for the award of costs and attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff.

 As for the self-audit provisions ofH.R. 1439, the Department is deeply concerned with the
 extraordinarily broad privileges for employer self-audit information that the bill would afford.
 The bill would provide that virtually any employer evaluation of workplace conditions, practices,
 or operations could be withheld by the employer in any OSHA inspection or enforcement
 proceeding, with narrow exceptions. The bill protects any information obtained or prepared in
 connection with safety and health audits, and defines an audit as including any evaluation of


                                                  2
                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                                Hex-Llump Conversion

workplace conditions, practices, processes, operations, or systems designed to identify and
prevent potential or real workplace hazards. In short, even the smallest amount of knowledge
an employer gains through a daily walkaround of a plant, or from a conversation about a
particular process, is immune from disclosure to OSHA. In effect, this bill would immunize from
disclosure all knowledge an employer has about safety or health in his workplace, or about his
workplace's compliance with the OSH Act.

The key problem with the bill is that it would place off-limits to OSHA the very information it
needs to determine whether there has been a violation of the Act, unless OSHA first establishes
that a violation exists -- a greater impediment to OSHA enforcement would be hard to devise.
In many cases, particularly those involving workplace accidents, employer records provide not
only the best evidence but the only evidence. The bill's requirement that OSHA independently
establish any violation before having access to employer-generated information would bar OSHA
from access to the very information it needs to accurately assess conditions at the workplace, and
would gravely impair the agency's ability to enforce the Act. The bill's supposed exception for
cases where the Secretary proves employer bad faith amounts to requiring the agency to prove a
willful violation before it is even granted access to the most basic health and safety data.

Conscientious employers know that there are many advantages to employer-sponsored workplace
audits and evaluations, and do not need an added incentive. Employers who can demonstrate
good faith efforts to identify and correct workplace hazards have learned they have everything to
gain by sharing this information with OSHA. On the other hand, an employer who learns of
hazardous conditions but who has taken no action to protect his employees, may have rcason to
conceal such audits from OSHA. The self-audit provisions ofH.R. 1439 would primarily
benefit such employers. Because these provisions would seriously impair OSHA's compliance
program without contributing to employee health or safety, the Department strongly opposes
H.R. 1439.

H.R. 1459, "Models of Safety and Health Excellence Act of 1999"

The Department is a strong supporter of the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), which would
be codified by H.R. 1459. I would like to thank the sponsors of the bill, Representative Petri
and Representative Andrews, who shared drafts ofH.R. 1459 with OSHA and asked for our
comments before introducing the bill. While we would like to work with you further on the
employee participation requirement, we are pleased to say that we endorse your efforts to codify
the program, and believe it will help raise the stature ofthe VPP, OSHA's oldest and most
important recognition program for excellence in workplace safety and health management and
cooperation.

The Office of Management and Budget has advised that thereis no objection to the presentation
ofthis report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.

                                           Sincerely,


                                                3
