TE::t{T:
This bill basically sanctions those who transport minors across state·
lines for the purposes of having an abortion if the minor does not meet
the parental notification requirements of the state in which they reside.
There is a life of the minor exception. The Republicans have this bill on
a very fast track with hearings scheduled for this week.  DOJ has not
fully reviewed the legislation yet, but Bill Marshall's view is that there
no strong constitutional grounds on which to oppose it. My understanding
is that legislative affairs is considering sending a decision memo to the
President shortly.
