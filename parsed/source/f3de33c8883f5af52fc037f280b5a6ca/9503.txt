TEXT:
At this afternoon's meeting, we decided to pursue a legislative fix to the
registry date.  Alan E. (INS Leg.) and Peter J. are supposed to get
together to determine (1) whether there is a Rep. member who is willing to
carry some water on this; and (2) what vehicle we could try to attach this
to this session. The odds of getting this done this session seem slim,
since there has not been much background work on the issue. However, we
agreed it was worth trying. Also, Maria E. is going to call Becerra at Ie
t him know that there are no administrative options to solve the 377
problem, but that we are going to try to pursue the registry fix.   She is
also going to let him know that our strategy has to be not to link the
registry fix to the late amnesty cases and not to talk about 400,000
people being affected.  The highest number of folks that could be affected
by the registry change is 80,000 (the number who were granted work
authorizatlon over the years), but the number is likely much less than
that (those who could demonstrate that they have been in the u.S. since
January·l, 1982).  I am going to double back with DOJ/INS and Peter and
will keep you posted.
