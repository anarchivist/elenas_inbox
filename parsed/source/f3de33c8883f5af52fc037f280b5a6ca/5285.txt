higher education. The meeting will feature three panels: The first panel will present
perspectives on the value of diversity in higher education; the second panel will present
research on what works on campus to promote the benefits of diversity; and the third
panel will discuss the many methods used to promote inclusion and diversity in higher
education including affirmative action, outreach, recruitment, pipeline programs, and
TRIO programs.

Promising Practices. The working group is currently identifying and evaluating
additional examples of promising practices for dissemination through the Intemet. We
will post 26 more examples on the website by December 3. As part of the December
town hall meeting, we plan to highlight 5-10 of these promising practices in a breakout
