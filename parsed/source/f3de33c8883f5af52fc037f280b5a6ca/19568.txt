      Republicans Likely to Join on the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights Legislation.
      Congressman Ganske met with Congressman Dingell this week to infonn him that at least five
      Republicans, and hopefully more, are willing to sign onto the Dingell/Gephardt patients' bill of
      rights legislation. We view this as extremely positive news, as it will no doubt create additional
      pressure on the Republicans to produce patients' rights legislation. We are hearing that the
      Republican House task force is drafting legislation in this area, but that it will likely include
      "poison pill" provisions that are designed to slow this legislation down, including medical
      malpractice and expansions of multi-employer welfare associations (MEWAs) that could
      undennine the insurance market. However, we believe that if Republicans sign onto the
      Democratic bill it would provide additional leverage to eliminate some of the objectionable
      provisions the task force will likely propose. We are reaching out to Dr. Ganske and Mr.
      Dingell to detennine if we could set up a high profile meeting with the Republican co-sponsors
      in the White House next week. Such an event would receive great attention and would enhance
      the likelihood of Congressional passage this year.

      Update on Assisted Suicide Issue. A recent study for the New England Journal of Medicine on
      assisted suicide found that five percent or less of physicians have ever administered injections or
      prescribed medications to hasten the death oftenninally ill patients. However, the study also
      found that 36 percent of physicians would write lethal prescriptions if they were legal. This
      broadly reported study might increase Republicans' interest in seeking Federal legislation to
      overturn Oregon's assisted suicide law. Their interest in this issue will further intensify when
      the Justice Department offers its legal interpretation concluding that the Drug Enforcement
      Agency has no statutory authority to regulate the practice of doctors prescribing medication that
      hasten death. We believe that we will have to release this interpretation within the next two
      weeks. We will be sending you a memo next week that outlines options that position us best to
      respond to the likely Republican initiative.
