TEXT:
I took part in the end of tonight's ED-DOJ-WH Counsel's office call.
DOJ's Adarand concerns, at this point, do not go to the heart of the
legislation itself, but are based more on the strength of the findings and
the way that rationale is described.   All believe that these concerns can
be addressed without too much trouble.

Depending on the composition of the ED/Senate staff meeting set for
tomorrow, it was agreed that ED could take up a DRAFT-stamped copy and
walk through the bill for staff in the morning.  Simultaneously, DOJ is
going to pull together a meeting to agree on suggested wording changes on
a few portions of the bill, with the understanding that ED will be in a
position to deliver an administration-cleared draft by tomorrow   .
afternoon.   Fallback approach is for ED to reschedule the meeting with
staff for the afternoon.
