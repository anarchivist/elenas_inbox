TEXT:
The DLC Welfare to Work Conference is still pending with scheduling for
sometime before August 22.  Margie at the DLC today suggested that they
could piggy back the conference onto the National Conference of State
Legislators in Philadelphia on Aug. 6-10.  Do you think that's a more
attractive option than doing something in D.C.?
