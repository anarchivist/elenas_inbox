TEXT:
John is scheduled to speak Thursday (12/3) to 150 Treasury Department
lawyers (including individuals from Treasury's various bureaus such as
IRS, ATF, etc ... ) who are attending the fourth annual Treasury General
Counsel Conference.

The Conference organizers have asked John in the broadest terms to talk
about Administration priorities.  Clearly there's a lot to speak about:
Social Security, International Finance, the 2000 Budget, domestic agenda
items (Patients' Bill of Rights and Education), etc.

DO you have any thoughts concerning the themes / "issues he should focus on?
