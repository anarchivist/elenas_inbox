      I ran these by USDA and HHS/FDA again.  All the changes were basically
    fine, they wanted a clarification that "last year's $40 million" is for
    activities that are not done but are still on-going as they are part of
    the FY '98 budget.    FDA pointed out that they were developing HACCP in
    '96, we should just say they it wasn't implemented yet.  So I did that too.=========

                          Questions and Answers on Food Safety
                                    January 19, 1998



Q:   What steps is the Administration taking to improve food safety?

A:   Last year we launched a new Presidential food safety initiative, and added more than $40
     million to the FY '98 budget. With that money we started putting in place new
     science-based preventive systems to improve the safety of seafood, meat and poultry and
     began work on a new early warning system to help detect and respond to outbreaks of
     foodborne illness. This year, our budget will seek an even more substantial increase in
     resources to improve food safety. The resources will go to a variety of initiatives,
     including: giving FDA authority to prevent the import of produce from countries without
     safety precautions equivalent to our own; hiring FDA inspectors to improve the safety of
     our nation's fruits and vegetables, both domestic and imported; developing new ways for
     federal inspectors to detect food-borne illnesses in meat and poultry and determine the
     source of contamination; improving educational outreach on proper food handling; and
     further expanding our early warning system and strengthening state surveillance activities
     for foodborne illnesses.



Q.   A recent story revealed that USDA did not close down a plant despite 1,700
     violations. What are you doing to make sure our meat and poultry are safe to eat?

A.   We have to keep improving our food safety systems. And I am committing more
     resources than ever to the problem, and modernizing food safety for meat and fruits and
     vegetables and the water we drink. There are several important facts to remember in
     regard to this specific story. First, although the inspectors did not close the plant -- and
     in my view that was a wrong decision -- they did take actions to correct the plant's bad
     practices and to prevent all unsafe food they found from reaching the public. Second,
     those events occurred in 1996 -- before my Administration began implementing the
     Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system for meat. Under this
     system, inspectors will document food safety violations; they will shut down the plant
     where there are repeat failures; and they will insist that the plant take a wide range of
     measures to prevent any future contamination before the plant can reopen. Finally, the
     Administration has asked Congress for additional enforcement authority to fine
     companies for violations of food safety standards. Currently, USDA can't fine
     companies that violate food safety standards.
