PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND MARKETING
THE ROSE GARDEN
June 1, 1999

Acknowledgments: the First Lady; AG Reno; FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky;
Arthur Sawe [sah-WAY] and his mother Caroline; Mayor DeeDee Corradini, US
Conference of Mayors; Wash. State Rep. Mary Lou Dickerson

        In recent weeks, and in the wake of tragedy, we have witnessed
something truly remarkable: Americans from all regions and all walks of
life coming together to prevent youth violence.  As you may recall, the
First Lady and I traveled to Colorado recently and spoke with the students
of Columbine High School.  In one sudden moment, just six weeks ago, they
lost much of the innocence of youth; but I am pleased to say that they
have lost little of its idealism.  They have held fast to their faith in a
better future 0) a future where hatred no longer hardens the heart; a
future where values, and not violence, make up our common culture.
,.

              The national grassroots campaign Hillary described is rooted
     firmly in that faith.  We know we can prevent youth violence if we work
     together, across all the lines that may divide us; and assume
     responsibility rather than assign blame. That responsibility, of course,
     begins at home.  Parents must guide children as they grow, and stay
     involved even as children become more independent. That responsibility
     must be reinforced at school; in houses of worship; and in the community
     as a whole. The more invested we are in the lives of our children, the
     less isolated they can become.

              Those of us in public service must also do our part, and fulfill
     our responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and
     children. To that end, there is a broad and growing national consensus
     that says we must do more.  I am grateful that a number of gun
     manufacturers came here to the White House last month and voiced their
     support for our common-sense approach. And I am encouraged that the
     Senate 0) by the narrowest of margins 0) agreed to close the deadly gun-show
     loophole; require that safety locks be sold with every handgun; and raise
     the age of handgun possession from 18 to 21: To the House of
     Representatives I say:  Pass these common-sense measures into law, and do
     so swiftly when you return to Washington.  DonO,t put our childrenO,s safety
     on hold 0) put it on top of your agenda.

     Members of the entertainment industry must also do their part. They 0) and
     the rest of us 0) must not kid ourselves:  our children are being weaned on
     a dependable, daily dose of violence. Violent movies and television
     programs; violent CDs and video games; violent ads for violent products.
     Studies show that the typical 18-year-old has seen 200,000 dramatized acts
     of violence and 40,000 dramatized murders. Kids become numb to it.   They
     have to. And as their tolerance for violence grows, so, in many cases,
     does their taste for it. We should not be surprised that half the video
     games the typical seventh-grader plays are violent ones.

     Anyone who doubts the impact of this cultural assault can look at hundreds
     of studies, three decadesO, worth, showing the direct link between violent
     entertainment and violent behavior. What these studies tell us is that
     for adults, the boundary between fantasy and reality is a bright line; but
     for vulnerable children, it can be blurred .. Kids who are steeped in the
     culture of violence become desensitized to it and more capable of
     committing it themselves.

     That is why I have strongly urged people in the industry to consider the
     consequences of what they create. Our administration has also worked to
     give parents the tools to protect their kids 0) and block violent
     programming from entering their living rooms. We have developed a
     voluntary rating system for television, and a V-Chip that enables parents
     to enforce it. WeO,ve also made pr9gress on parental screening for the
     Internet and ratings for Internet game sites.

     Still, when violent entertainment made for adults is marketed to children,
     it undermines the rating systems designed to protect them. Advertisements
     have the power to egg children on and lure them in.  Every parent knows
     what a commercial for sugar cereal 0) or the latest O&Star Wars08 toy 0) can
     do to kids. They want that product and, one way or another, theyD,re
     likely to get it. An ad for an R-rated movie may have the same effect on
     a child. And we shudder to think of the impact of ads for so-called 0&
     first-person shooter08 video games 0) like the recent ad for a Sony video
     game that invites players to O&get in touch with your gun-toting.
     cold-blooded murdering side.D8 Now, Arthur obviously has the inner


strength and the upbringing to reject that kind of violent appeal.   But
not every child does.

To any company that sells violent products, I say this:  Children are more
than consumers. They are our future, and our most precious resource.
They should not be the targets of the marketing of violence.

Today, I am asking the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission to study the extent to which the video game, music and movie
industries market violence to children 0) and whether those industries are
abiding by their own voluntary systems of regulation. And I issue this
challenge to the owners of movie theaters and video stores, to
distributors, and to anyone at the point of sale: enforce strictly the
ratings systems on the products you sell.  Check IDs.  Draw the line.   If
gratuitous violence is getting into PG-13-rated movies, then ratings
systems should be reevaluated.  And if underage kids are getting into
R-rated movies or buying violent video games, then ratings systems should
be better enforced.

I want to thank Senators Brownback, Lieberman, Hatch, and Kohl for the
groundbreaking work theyu,ve done on this issue. And I want to commend
Washington State Representative Mary Lou Dickerson, who is here with us
today.  Inspired by an article she read about young Arthur, Rep. Dickerson
helped create a task force on video game violence.  And, thanks to her
work with the washington Retailers Association, video game retailers in
their state will now voluntarily check IDs and block sales of violent
games to minors.

I urge others to follow their lead. For this is the way we will make
progress: by constant and coordinated effort 0) as individuals and
industries, as communities and as a nation.  Youth violence is a problem
we face together 0) and it is a problem America can solve together.  By
joining hands in this effort we can truly build a safer future for all our
children in the 21st Century.  Thank you.
