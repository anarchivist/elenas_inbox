TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:
The Race Initiative has scheduled a meeting between Erskine and the
Leadership Conference for Civil Rights for Friday from 1 to 3:00pm in the
Roosevelt Room. The purpose of the meeting is to update Wade Henderson
and his Executive Committee on what the Initiative (including the White
House) has been up to since last summer. According to the PIR, they had
originally intended to have Frank Raines do an overview of the budget
items related to the Initiative, but now would also like both Gene and
Bruce to do short (5 min.) discussions of Initiative-related policy. Are
either of you available to do this?

I have spoken with NEC and OMB folks about coordinating the outlines for
these updates.  Judy Winston would like to have these by COB tomorrow (for
Erskine's briefing book).

Thanks.

Julie
