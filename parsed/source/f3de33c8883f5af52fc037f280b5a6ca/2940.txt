    DRAFT LETTER TO HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE AND SENATE FINANCE
    COMMITTEE

    We are writing to urge you not to include the provisions on the minimum wage and welfare work
    requirements reported out of the House Ways and Means and Education and the Workforce
    Committees in the reconciliation bill.

    Because it demands responsibility and requires work, the welfare law that the President signed is
    the centerpiece of our efforts to transform welfare from a way of life to a second chance. The
    Administration's strong commitment to move people from welfare to work has already produced
    tremendous success: the welfare rolls have plummeted by over 20 percent since the President
    took office, with 2.9 million fewer people on welfare, largely because of our strong economy and
    the welfare waivers the Administration granted to 43 states.

    Now the welfare law give us an unprecedented opportunity to work together to build on this
    success. We are pleased that we have maintained a good working relationship with the
    Congress as we have implemented the law, and that we have both adhered to an understanding
    that changes to the law must be considered on a bipartisan basis.

    In order to succeed, however, our strategy must also reflect the reality that citizens confront when
    they try to leave the welfare rolls for work. Under the old system, welfare too often paid better
    than work. Turning this around has required us to move on many fronts. We insisted that the
    welfare law include an additional $4 billion for child care. We worked to increase child support
    collections, leading to dramatic growth of 50%. We expanded the earned income tax credit to
    help 40 million Americans. And we increased the minimum wage. Now we are working to
    make transportation more available and to expand health care coverage for the children of
    low-income working parents. Since the private sector must provide the bulk of the jobs for
    those leaving welfare, we have urged the corporate community to do its part, and a new Welfare
    to Work Partnership is now leading the business community's effort to extend job opportunities
    to those seeking to remake their lives. All of this is designed to ensure that those on welfare
    have the same incentive to work as the rest of our society -- because work is rewarded.

    Now we face the minimum wage question. To be consistent with our goals in welfare reform,
    the Administration believes strongly that all those who can work should work, and that those
    who work should earn the minimum wage. By contrast, the House Ways and Means and
    Education and the Workforce Committees proposals would undermine our goals by effectively
    creating a subminimum wage for workfare participants. In addition, they would weaken the
    welfare law's work requirements -- requirements that were the subject of arduous negotiations
    and ultimately bipartisan agreement. It is not appropriate to propose these changes in the
    context of a reconciliation bill to enact the bipartisan agreement to balance the budget.

    Finally, it is important to note that neither Congress nor the President ever envisioned workfare
    as the primary tool to move people from welfare to work. While workfare has a limited,
    transitional role to play in many states, private sector jobs are the only way to ensure that those
    on welfare become truly independent. We are confident that states that are serious about welfare


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




    reform will be able to meet and exceed the work rates in the law, particularly if they emphasize
    private sector jobs where of course the minimum wage has always been a given.

    We urge you to reject these proposals as we work together to create a fair and enduring system
    that requires and rewards work.

    (FYI: I've asked for but don't yet have old NEe materials on why minimum wage is great)
