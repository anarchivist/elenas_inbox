TEXT:
I am working on setting up the initial planning meeting of the group
addressing federal enforcement of civil rights.   We thought the initial
meeting should be with the race initative contacts from ED, EEOC, HHS,
HUD, Labor, Justice, Interior, Treasury and USDA.   Follow-up meetings
might also include the agencies' civil rights divisions/offices.

We can meet the week of the 11th (Tom is out)'or during the week of the
18th. Do you have a preference for when the meeting takes place?
