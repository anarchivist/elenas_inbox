Draft 8113/97 1pm      PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
               RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IN THE FEDERAL WORKPLACE
                             THE WHITE HOUSE
                              AUGUST 14, 1997

        Today, I want to talk about a subject that has shaped our national identity more than any
other these past 220 years -- religious freedom. It is, of course, one of the founding principles of
our great democracy. Thomas Jefferson wrote, "We have solved ... the great and interesting
question whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in government and obedience to
the laws. And we have experienced the quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving
every one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion which are the inductions of his
own reason and the serious convictions of his own inquiries."

        Our founders understood that religious freedom was a two-sided coin. The Constitution
protected the free exercise of religion, but also prohibited the establishment of religion by the
state. This careful balance is the genius of the First Amendment. It does not, as some have
implied, make us a religion-free country. It makes us the most religious country in the world.
Throughout our history, men and women have come to this nation to escape religious persecution
and secure this precious freedom. They and others have built a nation in which religious
practices and religious institutions have thrived -- exactly because each individual has been able
to choose for himself or herself whether, and if so, how to worship.

       In that spirit, we have continued to be a leader in promoting religious rights throughout
the world, through the establishment last year of the Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on
Religious Freedom Abroad, as well as our willingness to press for religious freedom at the
United Nations and in our relations with other nations.

        Last month, Secretary Albright released a report on our policies in support of religious
freedom. The report underscores our commitment to helping people of all faiths live free of
persecution and to worship in the freedom that is their birthright. This commitment is a key part
of our human rights policy and an important focus of our diplomacy.

        In the four-and-a-halfyears I have served as President, nothing has given me greater joy
than the efforts of this Administration, in tandem with a broad coalition of individuals and
organizations from practically every faith, to support freedom of religion here in America. I
want to thank all the members ofthe coalition for your guidance and support.

        I especially want to thank Steve McFarlane [McFar-lin]ofthe Christian Legal Society,
Marc Stern of the American Jewish Congress, Eliot Mincberg of People for the American Way
and Oliver Thomas, formerly of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs for all you have
done to make today's announcement possible. You are the living embodiment of what we mean
when we talk about One America -- people coming together across the lines of race and ideology
and faith to protect our precious American liberties. I think we would all agree that the most
basic of those liberties is religious freedom.
                                                                               ex-Dump Conversion


         You stood with us in 1993, when I was proud to affinn the rightful and historic place of
religion throughout our society by signing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. I am
disappointed that the Supreme Court struck down parts of that Act in June. But, we are pleased
that its provisions still apply in the federal workplace.

       You also stood with us in 1995, when we issued guidelines reaffinning that our young
people did not have to leave their religious beliefs at the schoolhouse door. With the First
Amendment as our guide, we clarified the religious expression pennitted in schools. I strongly
believe that our young people need more, not less of the values, hope, belief and convictions that
come with faith.

        Today, you are with us again as we issue guidelines to clarify and reinforce religious
expression in the federal workplace. These guidelines will ensure that federal employees and
employers will respect the rights of those who engage in religious practices or espouse religious
beliefs, as well as those who reject religion altogether.

       The guidelines do three things. First, they clarify that federal employees may engage in
personal religious expression to the greatest extent possible consistent with workplace efficiency
and the requirements oflaw. Second, they clarify that federal employers may not discriminate in
employment on the basis of religion. And finally, they clarify that an agency must reasonably
accommodate employees' religious practices. Today, I am instructing the Office of Personnel
Management to distribute these guidelines to all civilian branch agencies and officials, and we
expect all employees to follow them carefully.

        As a life-long practicing Baptist, I cannot imagine a public or private existence without
the comfort and guidance of my chosen Faith. But I believe that God is too powerful and too
mysterious to be contained within the orthodoxy of anyone religious faith. My greatest hope is
that America can enter the new century and the new millennium as the most successful
multiracial, multi ethnic and multireligious democracy the world has ever known. We will get
there through efforts like this -- men and women of goodwill coming together to respect and
celebrate their great diversity, while uniting around an ideal that transcends anyone idea or
philosophy or religion. Religious freedom is an American ideal, indeed a human ideal, that we
have strengthened today. Let us pledge to always stand together to honor this great gift and
preserve it for future generations.

       Thank you and God bless you all.
