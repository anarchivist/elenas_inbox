 Education Savings Accounts Pushed

                             By LIBBY QUAID Associated Press Writer

                             WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from both parties
                             renewed a push Wednesday for education tax
 legislation that
                             President Clinton vetoed last year.

                             The measure offers tax breaks for parents who
 send their
                             children to private schools and allows tax-free
 withdrawals from
                             education savings accounts for pre-college
 expenses.

                             Clinton vetoed the legislation last summer,
 saying it would have
                             provided $3 billion to fund tax benefits for
 richer families while
                             doing "virtually nothing for average families."

                             Congressional backers believe they have a
 "strong, bipartisan
                             coalition building here, "     said one sponsor,
 Rep. Kenny Hulshof,
                             R-Mo.

                             Supporters are "struggling against a very large
 component,
                             particularly in this city, who are committed to
 the status quo;
                             they don't want to change, "    said Sen. Paul
 Coverdell, R-Ga.

                             The Democratic co-sponsors are Sen. Robert
 Torricelli of New
                             Jersey and Rep. William Lipinski of Illinois.


                            The bill would expand the tax-free savings
 accounts that
                            Congress created in 1997, with Clinton's
 blessing, to provide for
                            college expenses.

                            " I t ' s a lot easier for parents to sock money
 away each month
                            during a child's early years,"    Hulshof said.

                            Under the legislation lawmakers are introducing
 this year,
                            covered expenses would include private tutors,
 horne
                            computers, supplies and transportation. It also
 contains other tax
                           breaks for prepaid tuition plans and
 employer-paid tuition, along
                           with breaks to make it easier for communities to
 build new
                           public schools.

                            Families, employers, friends, relatives and
 other sponsors could
                            contribute up to $2,000 a year to the accounts
 on a child's
                            behalf. Accrued interest and withdrawals would
 be tax-free; the
                            money could pay for expenses beginning with
 kindergarten.

                            While the average family's tax break would be
 small, Coverdell
                            said, the savings accounts would leverage up to
 $6 billion over
                            five years.

                            The accounts would cost the Treasury an
 estimated $1.5 billion
                            over 10 years.
