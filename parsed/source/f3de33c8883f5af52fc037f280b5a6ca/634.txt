TEXT:
What are we doing to bolster NGA's consideration of resolutions exempting
the disabled from the immigrant bans as well as more money for welfare to
work?    That would be consistent with what we're gonna be pushing in our
Budget.    Last year, we weighed in with the NGA on a variety of priority
items;   I think we should push our views this year. And given the opening
referenced in the Post and Times stories, we could have a real impact on
their consideration of immigrant issues.    Suggestions:
         I know that Frank Raines is meeting with Governors later this
week;   I intend to give him talkers on these issues.    Shouldn't we get
talkers on both these issues to all White House senior folks that are
meeting with Governors this week?
         Can we get HHS (Monahan) and maybe other Departments pushing these
issues with the Governors?
         I know Sherri Steisel at NCSL would like to help on immigrants.
How can we use NCSL to increase the visibility of the issue?
