MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report



       Crime - Boston Juvenile Homicide: Last night, a Boston youth was shot to death,
ending Boston's two and a half-year streak of no juvenile homicides by firearms. The 16
year-old Dorchester youth was unarmed and had no known criminal history.

        Crime - Homicide Study: This week, the Justice Department released a final National
Institute of Justice study of homicide in eight U.S. cities. Some of the key findings of the
ten-year study (1985-94) include: 1) Guns are increasingly becoming the preferred means of
homicide; 2) Homicide rates are closely linked to cocaine use, with a strong link between crack
cocaine use and violence; 3) Youth black males between ages 18 to 24 represented a
disproportionately high percentage of homicide victims, with homicide rates increasing for this
group in all cities; 4) Homicides where the victim and offender were related or intimate made up
only a small portion of all homicides, but were a sizable portion of female-victim homicides; and
5) No solid links were established between homicide rates and factors such as income
distribution, education level, or household type. Employment levels and poverty were found to
be somewhat related to homicide trends. The eight cities studied were: Atlanta, Washington
DC, Detroit, Tampa, New Orleans, Richmond, Indianapolis, and Miami.

       Crime - Death Penalty Study: This Sunday, the Justice Department will release new
data showing an increase in prisoner executions. During the first 11 months of this year, 70
prisoners were executed in 16 states-- 25 more than all of last year. Texas alone accounted for
more than half of all executions (36), the highest number in a single state since 1930. In
addition, in 1996, the length of time a prisoner sat on death row before execution was 10 years
and 5 months-- 9 months shorter than 1995. ,Among the 358 individuals executed between 1977
and 1996: 56 percent were white; 37 percent were black; 21 percent were Hispanic; and 3 percent.
were other races.

      Welfare Reform -- Reports Released by Union-Sponsored Group: On Wednesday,
Jobs With Justice, a group funded primarily by AFSCME, SEIU, and the AFL-CIO, released two
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
reports critical of welfare reform. The first, called Welfare Reform as we know it, seems
designed to discourage states and cities from sponsoring workfare programs. As you know, the
public employee unions are very concerned about the effects of workfare because, as the report
says, "In large cities already crippled by downsizing, workfare participants have proven to be an
irresistible, cheap labor force that can be applied to waning city services." Welfare recipients
quoted in the report complain that workfare assignments don't lead to real jobs, aren't paid as
well as comparable work, and don't meet all the required health and safety standards. While
some of the specific charges are worrisome, the general implication is that no one on welfare
should be required to work unless they are trained and placed in a skilled, well-paid, unionized
job.

       The second report, Welfare Reform: The Jobs Aren't There argues that there are twice as
many welfare recipients seeking work as there are low wage jobs. First, we should note that the
U.S. economy has historically shown a tremendous capacity to absorb new workers -- such as the
millions of women and baby boomers who joined the workforce in the last 30 years -- and most
economists expect it to do so again. Second, we believe that this particular study understates the
number of low-skilled jobs being created and overstates the number of welfare recipients needing
jobs. For example, the study estimates that only 430,000 low skilled jobs were created in 1997
and 270,000 will be created in 1998. This underestimates the number of low skilled jobs'
because it counts only jobs in certain occupational categories (those with incomes in the lowest
20 percent.) This method leaves out many low-skilled jobs in other occupational categories,
where the average income is higher. It also seems low compared to the total new jobs being
created -- 404,000 in November alone.

        The report also assumes one-third of all adults on welfare, or 1.2 million persons, will
enter the labor force next year. This is a very high estimate. While it is true that 30 percent of
adult welfare recipients must be participating in "work activities" in 1998, not all will need
newly created jobs because 1) some welfare recipients are already working and thus won't need
"new" jobs; and 2) states can lower the required work participation rate due to caseload
reductions -- for example, a state whose caseloads had declined by 10 percent since 1995 would
have to meet only a 20 percent work participation rate. For these reasons, HHS staff have
estimated that between 440,000 and 880,000 individuals will need to participate in "work
activities" under TANF in 1998 (the upper bound aSsumes no caseload reduction). However,
not all 440,000 to 880,000 people would need "jobs" as defined by economic statistics because
the law allows community service, workfare, vocational education, high school (for teen parents),
and some job search to counttoward ''work participation."

        Welfare - Food Stamps for Legal Immigrants: You asked about an article in this
week's New York Times that describes the impact of food stamp cutoffs on legal immigrants in
New York. Nation-wide, the welfare law cut off food stamps to over 700,000 legal immigrants.
 Most cutoffs took place in September. Our budget last year focused on restoring SSI and
Medicaid benefits to legal immigrants, rather than food stamps, and as you know we achieved a
significant restoration of these benefits in the balanced budget act. Now advocates are pushing


                                               2

                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

    us to tum to food stamps and include full restoration of these benefits in our new budget, at a cost
    of$3.2 billion over five years.
             We are considering this option as part of the budget process, although a partial restoration
    seems more likely -- restoring benefits to some subset of the population, such as children,
    families with children, and/or others. One important question is how seriously Congress would
    consider such a proposal. In contrast to this year's battle over SSI and Medicaid, we will not
    have the forcing effect of impending cutoffs or the leverage of the balanced budget act this time
    around. The other major area where benefits have not been restored is SSI and Medicaid for
    legal immigrants who entered the country after the welfare law was signed, which would cost as
    much as $6.6 billion over five years. However, this area has considerably less political support
    at this time.

             States have the option of using their own funds to continue food stamp benefits, as a
    result of legislation we supported earlier this year. Twelve states have done so or plan to do so,
    at least in part, with Washington, Nebraska, and Rhode Island restoring all benefits. New York
    has made it a county option to restore benefits to the elderly and disabled only. New Jersey and
    California have offered partial restorations as well.
