TEXT:
In my effort to become knowledgable about the different issues in our
office and what announcements/events we have as options in the near
future, I wanted to verify the list you gave at today's message meeting.
I am trying to work with the team leaders to hear their ideas of what is
coming up, and will work with them to understand the specifics of each
one.  Here is the list I have of what you named in the meeting.

Nursing Homes
Over-the-Counter Prescription Labeling
Child Seats
Social Promotions Guide
Parental Discrimination

Do you have any others?
