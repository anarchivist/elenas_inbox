TEXT:
So that means we would need to release our deal in time for network news
on the 19th. Fat chance the networks would use our part of it. We're
probably better off giving this to the VP for a slow news day the
following week or the week after.  If it becomes a really big story, we
could always respond sooner.

Subject:         NAS brief and press schedule

NAS Schedule: Briefing is now set for 10 am Tuesday at USDA, room 104A,
NAS plans to give it to the press on the 19th for use beginning at 6 pm on
the 19th. Public release date is the 20th. NAS cautions its press
strategy is "soft." NAS is trying to keep this very small, on a "need to
know" basis. If you want to go, check in with Eric Olsen at 720-3808.
