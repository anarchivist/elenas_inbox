TEXT:
Laura, please hand to Elena:

Elena, turns out I misinformed you and the FLSA language that I just sent
you IS identical to the last letter we sent, to Roth.  (And it actually is
weaker than some of the House letters, where OMB went crazy without
checking with us.)  So I guess the precedent policy would argue we stick
with this.

Sorry about the mixup.
