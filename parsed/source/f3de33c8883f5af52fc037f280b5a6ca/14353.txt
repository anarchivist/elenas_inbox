           Here's where I think we are on the various items we need to
           respond on to HHS this week:

           1.   Q/A from 10/23 -- KEITH: I just sent over to you some edits
           from HHS to their draft from last week.  I had told John your
           staff would be working with the ACF and ASMB folks today and
           tomorrow with the goal of signing off early this week.

           2.   MEDICAID issues: Please check the following summary:

                  -   (b)/(d) waiver issue -- I think we are all OK with HHS
                      option #3.  I will give them the go-ahead on that this
                      morning

                  - all-or-none issue -- I sense a sea change in our view on
                    this issue.  I will let HHS know that they do not have
                    the go-ahead to go with the "all" answer. We should
                    regroup by phone on this this morning

                  - Medicaid Manual -- we need to let them know by Tues a.m.
                    if there is anything we want them to pullout of the
                    manual before the meetings this week with the states.
                    DIANA: can you check in with OMB and get back directly
                    to Sally

                  - Paper on $500M and on TANF/Medicaid eligibility: same as
                    manual. Need to let HHS know if we have any objections
                    to their approach. DIANA: can you coordinate with OMB
                    and get back to Sally directly?


          3.   TANF state plan issues

                  - Six states with minor timing issues: unless Keith/Elena
                    Diana/Emily get back to me this morning with a
                    significant problem on their proposal, I would like to
                    give them the goahead to proceed on the six states with
                    minor TANF timing issues

                  - NY/NJ/CAL -- bigger issues; everyone should read this
                    paper closely, and I will schedule a conversation on this
                    for Wednesday.

          4.   Technicals

                  I will call Rich this morning.   I will tell him our
general
          framework on timing: i.e., won't be done this week; will try to
          get something out by next week -- LRD in charge, but I will give
          him a few big comments like drop the bucket, drop the change in
          penalties, and drop the Title XX transfer. After that, I will
          tell him, his staff needs to work through LRD. Goal is to have
at
          least a small package up there next week.


          PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE TIMETABLES
          AND ASSIGNMENTS ABOVE ..   THANKS, JEREMY

TEXT:
I personally believe that HHS is wrong on this one.   I have never
been comfortable with the all or nothing requirement on optional
benefits. I believe it puts us in a position where some Governors
may say, for example, I would not kick those elderly immigrants
out of nursing homes if the Feds did not make me cover every
eligibility category in order for me to prevent this.   I simply do
not have the money for everyone. Along these lines, the all or
nothing approach serves, in my opinion, as a disincentive for some
states to even consider covering these optional benefits.
As I understand it from Pauline and Nancy Ann, Diana, you did not
reach final closure on this one yet? What is your reading on the
state of play? What is your feeling on this issue at this point?
