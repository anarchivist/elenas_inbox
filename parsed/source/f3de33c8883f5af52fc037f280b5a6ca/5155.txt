TEXT:
FYI, Ann Lewis might try to pull people together on this question of
whether reinstating the Points of Light should be announced at the,
President's speech at the Bush library dedication on Thursday, or through
a press release tomorrow.  (Elena: We are pushing for announcing it at
the speech itself, because it is more gracious toward Bush, but Ann Lewis
and Waldman and perhaps others disagree.)
