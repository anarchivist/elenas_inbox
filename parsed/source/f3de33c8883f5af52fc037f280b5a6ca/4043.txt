TEXT:
Here are suggested additions/modifications (in bold) to the data
collection project on education from Mike and me; Allison is also bringing
you marked up hard copies:

2. Educational status
a. Early childhood

   access to /participation in kindergarten/early childhood programs

b. Enrollment

   dropout/graduation     rates


   years to college degree; full-time/part-time college-going

   receive postsecondary student aid (federal, private)

c. Quality of Schooling

   Enrollment in college prep/core academic courses

d. Achievement

   Access to/participation in Advanced Placement (AP) programs

[It might be worthwhile looking at performance on a few states'
assessments, but it would be hard to do something like this nationwide]


possible Resources: National Center for Education Statistics -- Pat
Forgione/Maureen Treacy/Marty Orland 219-1828

Department of Education Planning and Evaluation Service-- Val Plisko
401-1958

Also, under economic status, we should note that it's the Small Business
Administration (not "Association.")
