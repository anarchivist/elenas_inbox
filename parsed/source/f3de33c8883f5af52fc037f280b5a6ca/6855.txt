TEXT:
CDC's testimony and McCain's tobacco bill take opposing positions on
extending ETS protection to the hospitality industry.  CDC's testimony·
tracks the position we agreed upon at our last ETS meeting, which would
require the hospitality industry to comply over time.  McCain excludes the
hospitality industry. Do we have a position on McCain's ETS provision?
Is it OK for CDC to take a different position than McCain? Commerits on
CDC's testimony were due at 3pm today to Bob Pellicci x54871.  Thanks.
