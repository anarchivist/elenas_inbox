                                SCHOOL SAFETY EVENT

                       DATE:           March 18, 1998
                       LOCATION: Grand Foyer
                       TIME:           1:40 pm-2:10 pm
                       FROM:           Bruce Reed and Rahm Emanuel


 L      PURPOSE

. To announce: (I) the findings of the first-ever national survey of school principals on violence
  and discipline in U.S. schools; (2) the availability of $17.5 million in new funding for school
  safety from the President's COPS program; and (3) recommendations by the Attorney General
  and Secretary of Education for an Annual Report on School Safety.

 II.    BACKGROUND

  You will speak to approximately 60 individuals from the education and law enforcement
  communities, as well as Members of Congress on the findings of a new survey on school
  crime. You will also announce new federal funds for school safety and receive the
  framework of a new report on school safety that has been jointly prepared by the Attorney
  General and Secretary of Education. Herb Berg, Superintendent of Alexandria Public
  Schools, will introduce you at this event and give an account of the success that T .C .
. Williams High School has achieved in reducing crime and violence. As a large, urban, and
  diverse high school, T.e. Williams should be at-risk for serious and violent crime problems.
   Instead, through law enforcement, parent involvement, and prevention, their crime and
  discipline problems have been significantly reduced.

 You will announce a new study by the Nationai"Center for Education Statistics on crime and
 violence in schools last year. The national survey is based on the responses of principals from
 more than 1,200 public elementary and secondary schools in the 50 states and Washington, D.C.
 Key findings of the survey include:

        (1)     47% of schools reported less serious 'crimes to law enforcement. This includes
                an estimated 190,000 physical attacks or fights without a weapon, 116,000
                incidents of thefts or larceny, and 98,000 incidents of vandalism.

        (2)     43% of schools reported no incidents of crime. And most schools -- or 80% --
                reported 5 or fewer crimes.

        (3)     Few schools -- only 10% -- reported any serious violent crimes. This includes an
                estimated 11,000 physical attacks or fights in which a weapon was used, 7,000
                robberies, and 4,000 rapes or other types of sexual assault.
                                                                          . Hex.Dump Conversion

       (4)     Schools with serious discipline problems were more likely to experience crime or
               violence. Principals rated absenteeism, tardiness, and fights as the 3 most
               common discipline problems among students.
                                                                              ,/
You will also announce that the COPS Office will make $17.5 million available for a new
community policing program to address school safety. This initiative will fund partnerships
between law enforcement, schools, and community groups to develop innovative approaches to
reduce crime on or near school grounds. Funding for this program was secured by Senator
Robb.

The Attorney General will present you with the framework of a new school safety report being
developed jointly by the Justice and Education Departments. The report is the result of your
December 6, 1997 radio address, where you called on the Attorney General and Secretary of
Education to issue an annual report that principals, parents, and local officials could use to
address their school crime problems. The full report will be released before the beginning of the
next school year.

The new report will include: an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an
overview of state and local crime reporting; examples of schools and strategies that are
successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class disruption; actions that parents can
take locally to combat school crime, including a local safety checklist; and a description of
resources available to schools and communities to help create safe, disciplined, and drug·free
schools.
