 TEXT:
 Just a reminder that the information described below is due to me first
 thing Tuesday morning.

 ATTENTION NEC: Today, the NGA added workforce development to the NGA
 Roundtable. That means that I will need talking points, questions to keep
 the discussion moving, and the most difficult Q's and A's for workforce


 development as well as well as the other issues described below.  I will
 assume that Anne Lewis is the contact for this topic and that I will
 receive the necessary paper from her, unless I hear otherwise.

 Thank you so much for your work on this.

 Subject:          NGA Roundtable

 Its that time again! On Monday, February 23, 1998, the President will
 convene the yearly NGA Roundtable with the Governors.  I have a
 preliminary list of the subjects the Governors will address, and will have
 confirmation on the topics this week.  I do not expect them to change.
 For those of you who are new to this, the drill is: after the opening
 statements (open press), the press departs, and one Governor will
 introduce each topic (total of 4-5 Govs, Child Care and Education may be
 one topic area), followed bY,open discussion.

 TOpics are:
 Highways: Robyn
 Tobacco: Kagan/Jennings
 Child Care: Klein
 Education: Cohen/Shireman
 Health Care Quality: Jennings

 For each topic, I would like two pages: one page with talking points for
 POTUS (brief) and questions to ask Govs to keep the discussion moving; and
 one page with the most difficult q's and a's.  Please send these to me no
 later than FIRST THING Tuesday, Februaruy 17, 1998.

 Thanks for your help.
