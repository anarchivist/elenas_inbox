an event on elder abuse. At this event, we are announcing a new study which concludes
that elder abuse is a major problem, as more than 500,000 Americans aged 60 and over were
the victims of abuse of neglect in their own homes during 1996. In addition, fraudulent
telemarketers continue to target frail and vulnerable older Americans as their primary victims.
You are taking a number of actions to crack down on combat elder abuse and fraud, including:
(1) announcing the creation of a new national center on elder abuse that will train officials to
better detect and respond to abuse and neglect; (2) calling on Congress to reauthorize the Older
Americans' Act, that helps states prevent elder abuse, counsel seniors on their rights, and
coordinate legal services for those who can not afford representation; (3) launching a new
partnership between the Justice Department and MRP to create Elder Fraud Prevention Teams;
and (4) releasing $3 million to combat telemarketing scams and other forms of fraud against
the elderly.
