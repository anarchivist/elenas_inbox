 H.R. 4380 -- DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
 (Sponsors:  Livingston (R); Louisiana; Taylor (R), North Carolina)


         This Statement of Administrative Policy provides the
 AdministrationD,s views on H. 4380, the District of Columbia
 Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations
 Committee.

         The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s support in
 developing a bill that provides sufficient Federal funding to implement
 the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government and Improvement
 Act of 1997 successfully. While the Committee bill is an improvement over
 the Subcommittee version of the bill, the Administration is deeply
 concerned about inadequate funding for the D.C. economic development
 initiative and objects to a number of provisions of the Committee bill, as
 described below. We urge the House to adopt a bill that addresses the
 AdministrationD,s concerns.

 Economic Development Initiative

         The Administration has requested $100 million for an economic
 development initiative in the District of Columbia:  $50 million to
 capitalize the locally-chartered National Capital Revitalization
 Corporation (NCRC), $25 million for critically needed management reforms
 authorized by the Revitalization Act and related to the cityD,s economic
 development infrastructure, and $25 million for Metrorail improvements
 that would support the Washington Convention Center project. We
 appreciate the CommitteeD,s action to provide $25 million to support
 transportation improvements associated with the Washington Convention
 Center, as requested, as well as $21 million for infrastructure
 improvements in the District.  However, we regret that the Committee has
 provided no funding for critically needed management reforms or funding to
 capitalize the locally-chartered NCRC.  The Administration strongly urges
 the Committee to appropriate additional resources for economic
 development.

 Public Education System

          The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s full support of
 charter schools and public schools in the District and supports the
 CommitteeD,s appropriation of $20.4 million in Federal funding for D.C.
 charter schools. We appreciate the decision to provide these resources
 from a source other than local public school funding.
 Abortion

         The Administration strongly opposes the abortion language of the
 Committee bill, which would prohibit the use of both Federal and District
 funds to pay for abortions except in those cases where the life of the
 mother is endangered or in situations involving rape or incest.  The


Administration continues to view the prohibition on the use of local funds
as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the District and would
support an amendment, if· offe.r.ed, to strike this prohibition.

 Micromanagement

        The Administration is concerned by the CommitteeD,s repeal of the
Residency Requirement Amendment Act of 1998 (D.C. Act 12-340). We believe
that the repeal of the residency requirement for new D.C. employees is an
unwarranted intervention into the affairs of the local government.

        Likewise, the Administration opposes provisions of the Committee
bill that would further restrict or otherwise condition management of the
District Government, thereby undercutting the Financial Responsibility and
Management Assistance Authority's (the Authority's) oversight and
responsibility for the District's budget and financial condition.
Further, the Administration is concerned about provisions that would
undermine the responsibilities of the Superintendent of the District of
Columbia Public Schools by legislating how local funds are used for
salaries and pay raises.

        The Administration is committed to working with the House to
produce a bill that will assist the District in its continued efforts
toward financial recovery. We look forward to working with the House to
address our mutual concerns.

Objectionable Amendments

        The Administration understands that three amendments may be
offered that would seriously undermine local control.  If such amendments
were adopted and included in the bill presented to the president, his
senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.

 An amendment to provide for the use of private school vouchers in the
District.   We would strongly oppose any legislation allowing the use of
Federal taxpayer funds for private school vouchers.   Instead of investing
additional resources in public schools, vouchers would allow a few
selected students to attend private schools and would draw resources and
attention away from the hard work of reforming public schools that serve
the overwhelming majority of D.C. students.   Establishing a private school
voucher system in the NationD,s Capital would set a dangerous precedent
for using Federal taxpayer funds for schools that are not accountable to
the public.

 An amendment that would prohibit adoptions in the District by couples
that are unmarried or not related by blood.
 An amendment that would prohibit the use of Federal or local funds for
needle exchange programs and would prohibit private agencies from
supporting needle exchange programs if they receive Federal funds (even if
the funds used for the needle exchange programs are their own) .
