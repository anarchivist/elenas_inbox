TEXT:
         Those who say they can do nothing about this are wrong.  By
changing the way they do business.    . by making programs, CDs, and video
games as if their own children were watching.    . members of the
entertainment community can make a big difference. Today, I am issuing a
challenge to the entire entertainment industry -- to stop showing guns in
any ads and previews children might see.   Second, I challenge theater
owners across America to enforce more strictly the age requirements on the
movies they show.   Theater owners should check IDs, not turn the other way
as a child walks unchaperoned into an R-rated movie. And third, I
challenge the movie industry to re-evaluate its ratings system --
specifically, the PG-13 rating, to determine whether it is allowing
gratuitous violence in movies viewed by children. Our administration is
fighting to do everything we can to protect our children. The
entertainment industry should do the same.
