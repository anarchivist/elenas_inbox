In the rapidly changing health care system that relies increasingly on technology and third party
payors, Americans are extremely concerned that their medical records will not be kept
confidential. In fact, a recent study showed that 75 percent of Americans are concerned that
computerized medical records will have a negative effect on the privacy of their medical records.
 Highly publicized media accounts have only fueled these fears. For example, until recently at a
Boston-based HMO, every single clinical employee could tap into patients' medical records, and
in another well publicized case, a local newspaper published the information about a
Congressional candidate's attempted suicide. Over a year ago, the Administration released a
report outlining important new protections to assure medical records are kept confidential.
These protections include: assuring that personal health information is used only for appropriate
purposes; requiring those who do keep medical records to guard them safely and not
inappropriately give them out; assuring that individuals can review and modify their own medical
records; and severely punishing those who violate these rules and an individual's privacy.
