TEXT:
jeanne asked me to ask Lautenberg's tobacco guy to find where his numbers
come from.   Unfortunately', Katz is in Rome on honeymoon. Lautenberg' s LD
said Katz didn't just come up with the numbers, he said they're
conservative, but couldn't vouch that someone at CBO/JTC put them all
together.   I'm happy to call JTC if you want, Jeanne thinks that will tick
OMB off.   (I also called the House sponsor who said he thought Lautenberg
had submitted the bill for analysis but didn't know for sure).
