TEXT:
I have confirmed, in conversations with Barbara Chow and Doris
Matsui, that there have been no new developments on the Hill with
respect to the Istook amendment on advocacy by non-profit groups.
Doris also confirmed with Marilyn Yager that Marilyn was
"anticipating" calls from some groups that oppose Istook, but had
not received any as of this morning's meeting when the topic came
up. Doris and I have been discussing Istook with representatives
of the non-profit community. Barbara Chow is planning to let us
know if any version of Istook is introduced in the Senate. At the
present time, according to Barbara, there is no indication that
Istook will make it into the Senate version of the CR.
