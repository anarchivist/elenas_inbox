     TEXT:
     Below is the revised SAP for S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership
     Act of 1999. The bill is expected on the Senate floor tomorrow morning
     (Wed. 3/3).  Barbara Chow has approved this version.  please provide final
     comments/clearance by c.o.b. tonight so that we can send the SAP early
     tomorrow morning.  Thank you.

     S. 280 - Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999
     (Sen. Frist (R) TN and 35 others)

     The Administration has long supported the concept of expanding ed-flex
     demonstration authority to permit all States to waive certain statutory
     and regulatory requirements of Federal education programs in a manner that
     will promote high standards and accountability for results, coupled with
     increased flexibility for States and local school districts to achieve
     those results. The Administration will support S. 280 as long as the
     bill's accountability provisions are strengthened to ensure that State
     waivers of Federal requirements enhance children's educational
     achievement.

     In order to ensure consistency between ed-flex authority and the
     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), which will be


    undergoing reauthorization this year, the Administration urges Congress to
    sunset this legislation upon enactment of the ESEA.

    The Administration strongly supports an amendment that is expected to be
    offered to S. 280 that would implement the President's proposal for a
    long-term extension of the one-year authority to help school districts
    reduce class size in the early grades, which the Congress approved last
    year on a bipartisan basis.  In order to hire qualified teachers, arrange
    for additional classrooms, and take other steps that are necessary to
    reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon as possible,
    that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more than one
    year.


    **********

    (Do Not Distribute Outside Executive Office of the President)

    This draft Statement of Administration Policy was developed by LRD (Connie
    Bowers) in consultation with the Department of Education (Riddle), EIML
    (Chow/White/Mustain), and DPC (Schnur).

    OMB/LA Clearance:

    BACKGROUND

    The Education Flexibili,ty Partnership Demonstration ("Ed-Flex") Act was
    enacted in 1994 as part of the Goals 2000 legislation in order to test the
    idea of giving States authority to waive Federal statutory and regulatory
    requirements that impede the development and implementation of education
    reforms in the State. Originally limited to six States, this
    demonstration authority was extended to 12 States by the Omnibus Budget
    Reconciliation Act of 1996.

    During the 105th Congress, a similar bill (S. 2213) was considered, but
    never voted on, by the Senate.  S. 2213 differed from S. 280 in that it
    would have amended the Goals 2000 Act to expand its education flexibility
    programs.  S. 280 is a freestanding bill that authorizes a new Ed-Flex
    program. The Administration did not issue a SAP on 2213 because ED opined
    that most Democrats were not supportive of the legislation.

    SUMMARY OF S. 280

    S. 280 would authorize the Secretary of Education to carry out an
    education flexibility program. Under the program, all States (as opposed
    to the 12 allowed in the current demonstration authority) could apply to
    waive for at least five years Federal statutory or regulatory requirements
    applicable to specified education improvement programs, if they
    demonstrate those requirements could hamper efforts to improve student
    achievement.  To provide accountability, the bill would require States to
    adopt academic standards and provisions for holding schools accountable
    for student achievement. The bill would also require that States have
    authority to waive their own comparable requirements as well.

    OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

    Congress is scheduled to work this year on the Elementary and Secondary
    Education Act (ESEA)  reauthorization. The Administration is developing
    an ESEA reauthorization proposal that will contain accountability
    provisions to strengthen the ESEA and student achievement.  By authorizing


    every State to waive rules, S. 280 as drafted could undermine an ESEA
    proposal that stresses accountability.

    PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORING

    According to EIML (Mustain), S. 280 would not affect direct spending or
    receipts; therefore, it is not subject to the PAYGO provisions of the
    Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.
