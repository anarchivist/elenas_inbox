                               1-200: THE WASHINGTON
                        ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE ACTION INITIATIVE


         Voters in Washington will go to the ballot this fall to vote on an initiative, 1-200, that
would eliminate affirmative action programs conducted by state and local government. The
initiative is almost identical to Proposition 209, which was approved in California. The polls
show that a significant majority of the public supports the initiative. However, other research
shows that voters change their minds when they understand its impact. This paper provides some
background information about the initiative.

Legal Impact

        The stated purpose of the initiative is to prevent the state as well as local governments
from granting a preference to any person based on race or gender. Washington state law and
federal law already bar discrimination based on race and gender, so there is no need to amend
current law to bar discrimination. The initiative changes current law, however, by preventing the
government from implementing affirmative action policies that take race or gender into account,
even if they accomplish important social policy objectives and comply with constitutional
requirements.

        There are many circumstances under which affirmative action programs are
constitutional. First, a state may decide to remedy prior discrimination. For example, it might
provide targeted assistance to minority or women-owned businesses in response to a history of
discrimination against these firms. Or, a state agency might set a goal to increase the hiring of
minorities if the number of minorities employed by the agency is clearly disproportional to the
labor force in the community. Second, governments can use affirmative action to achieve
diversity under some circumstances. For example, a state university may decide to enroll a
diverse student body by taking race or gender into account. All these programs have been upheld
by the courts. 1-200 would have the effect of eliminating them, except under narrow
circumstances when they are required by federal law or court order.

        Based on the California experience, we know that the initiative would eliminate many
valuable programs now operated by the state. For example, Washington provides a special
program to encourage girls in grades 6-12 to go into math, science and engineering fields. The
Early Identification Program (EIP) is intended to increase the number of minority teachers in
college and graduate schools by providing mentor programs, special counseling and other
assistance to undergraduates. Another program reaches out to minority students in middle
schools to provide support in math and English and to provide a special summer enrichment
program. The University of Washington takes race into account in its admissions process, along
with many other factors, in an effort to achieve a diverse student body. All these programs would
be barred if 1-200 is adopted. Although supporters of 1-200 say that they do not intend to end
recruiting and outreach, the initiative would create substantial uncertainty about these efforts,
too.
                                                                                   .Hex-Dump Conversion
Status of the Campaign

        Governor Gary Locke, Senator Patty Murray, Congressmen McDermott, Dicks, and
Smith, King County Executive Ron Sims, and many other senior officeholders in the state have
stated their opposition to 1-200. In addition, major civil rights organizations, women's groups,
religious organizations and many other groups are opposed. A number of major corporations
have also announced that they are working to defeat 1-200, including Boeing, Starbucks,
Hewlett-Packard, and others.

        A non-profit organization, the "No! 200 Campaign," was created exclusively to defeat
1-200. As of August 1998, No-200 had raised about $750,000. It has worked extensively with the
Governor's Office, civil rights groups, and women's organizations in Washington and across the
country to encourage opposition to 1-200. The Executive Director ofNo-200 is Kelly Evans,
206/441-9569. The campaign is actively seeking help from the administration, for example,
public statements by administration officials who visit the state.

The Arguments against 1-200

        Proponents ofI-200 want to portray their initiative as a simple bar on preferences. When
viewed this way, most of the public agrees. However, 1-200 has drastic effects on government
policy, which most of the public does not understand. Consequently, the most effective way to
defeat 1-200 is to explain its impact. These are suggested points to make:

        -- Affirmative action programs have been upheld by the courts as long as they are
carefully designed to remedy prior discrimination or to achieve other important government
objectives. The approach to affirmative action programs that do not meet these requirements
should be to mend them, not end them altogether. 1-200 goes too far.

        -- The state sponsors a large number of valuable programs targeted at persons who have
been shut out of opportunities in the past, including women who want to break into the labor
market, African-Americans, Latinos, and others. 1-200 would eliminate these programs even if
they are implemented in order to remedy prior discrimination.

         -- Washington colleges and universities now take race into account, along with other
factors, in order to enroll a diverse student body. The California experience has shown that
eliminating any consideration of race can drastically reduce the number of minorities who are
able to attend certain colleges and professional schools. Achieving diversity in higher education
is particularly essential in a state such as Washington where many of the largest employers
depend on large numbers of highly skilled, well educated employees.

       -- The eyes of the country will be on Washington this fall. Washington's tradition of
progressiveness and tolerance can provide a powerful message to the rest of the nation about
opening up opportunities to persons who have felt the effects of discrimination.
