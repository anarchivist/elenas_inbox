TEXT:
The weekly cabinet report indicated that reno is meeting with hal rogers
on wed 5/19--do you think they'll be discussing restructuring?? I know
we'll be getting briefed by ins on fri, but I thought Janet and Irene
might want to touch base with doj/ins and be sure we know what if anything
is going to be said on the subject.  Keep me posted
