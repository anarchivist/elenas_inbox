TEXT:
A little follow up on today's meeting:

1. President's 3 appointees:
Bill Bible-- Chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board
Robert Loescher -- Member of Tlingit Tribe of Alaska which runs bingo games
Richard Leone -- President of Twentieth Century Fund (public policy
research); opposed casino gambling in Atlantic City 20 years ago; close
to Torricelli who is very pro-gambling.

2. I am trying to track down the President's letter on the Commission you
referred to in the meeting. Once I get a copy, I will fax to you,
Counsel, and Justice for your files.

3. I am going to send you the Post article that ran over the weekend on
the governors and gambling. It highlights the internal struggle within
Republican party politics on the gambling issue and provides some
foreshadowing on what the Commission is likely to find ~uring their their
"study" of the issue.

Thanks.
