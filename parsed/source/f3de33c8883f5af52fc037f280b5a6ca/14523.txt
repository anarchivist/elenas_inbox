                              PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                             RADIO ADDRESS ON FAMILY LEAVE
                                  Saturday,Februaryl,1997

           Good morning. As a parent, I know how important it is to take responsibility for
    our children when they need us most -- when they are sick, when they need to go to the
    doctor, or when there is a parent-teacher conference at school. Fortunately, Hillary and I
    have never had to risk our jobs to be there for our daughter. We have never had to make
    the choice between being good parents and good workers. Today, I want to talk with you
    about what we have done, and what more we must do, to give that same assurance to every
    American family.

           One of the things that I most wanted to do when I became President was to help
    parents succeed both at home and at work. That is why I was so proud to make the
    Family and Medical Leave Act the first bill I signed as President, exactly four years ago
    this Wednesday.

           Family and Medical Leave allows people in companies with 50 or more employees to
    take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave -- to care for a newborn or newly-adopted child, or to
    be with a family member who is seriously ill, without fear of losing their job.

           Today, over half of all American workers share this important benefit. People like
    Christie Sens, a first grade teacher from Fairfax, Virginia who is here with me today.
    Christie was among the first Americans to make use of the new Family Leave law in 1993,
    when she and her husband were expecting their first child. Christie thought she would be
    forced to choose between the six weeks her school allowed for new mothers, or taking a
    whole year off without pay. Because of our new law, she was able to spend 12 full weeks
    at home -- recovering from her pregnancy, and spending precious time with her new
    daughter. Christie used the benefit again in 1995 for the birth of her second child.

            Family leave is not only family friendly -- it is employer friendly as well. Also with
    me today is Stan Sorrell, President and CEO of the Calvert Group, an investment firm in
    Bethesda, Maryland, and two of his employees who have used Family Leave. The Calvert
    Group started a Family and Medical Leave program three years before it became the law
    of the land. Like almost 90 percent of businesses covered by the law, they found that
    Family Leave is easy to administer, and costs them little or nothing. So we know it is
    working for both families and businesses. After all, in these past four years, American
    business created 11.2 million new jobs - more than any four-year term in our history.

            We must make it even easier for parents to take responsibility, and live up to their
    obligations to their children and their employers. Today, I call on Congress to expand the
    Family Leave Law, to give parents an additional 24 hours of unpaid leave each year -- to take a
    child or an elderly relative to a regular doctor's appointment, or to attend parent-teacher
    conferences at school. In doing so, we will make our families stronger and our workers

     more productive -- building the kind of country and economy we all want for our children.

            We must also address the fact that too many workers still do not know about the
     Family Leave law. That is why I am pleased to announce that we are launching a
     mnlti-media public education campaign, to spread the word about Family Leave; to make
     sure employers and employees have the facts; and to make sure everyone knows how to
     make this law work for them. It's not enough to help people have the tools to succeed; we
     must make sure they know what those tools are. The centerpiece of this campaign is a new
     800 number that any American can call to learn about Family and Medical Leave:
     1-800-959-FMLA. You can also get information through our Labor Department's website
     on the Internet: WWW.DOL.GOV.

            By expanding Family Leave to cover children's doctor's visits and parent-teacher
     conferences -- by helping more Americans learn about the opportunity of Family Leave -
     we will enable millions more Americans to meet their responsibilities, both at home and at
     work. That is how we must prepare our people for a new century, full of new promise and
     possibility.

             As parents, teachers, and business people; as members of the workforce and
     members of our communities - we all share a stake in the strength of our families. Our
     society can never be stronger than the children we raise, or the families in which we raise
     them.. That is why Family Leave is more than a single issue or accomplishment. It is at
     the heart of our approach to preparing America for the 21st Century, by ensuring that we
     can all meet our obligations, and make the most of the gifts that God gave us.

            Thanks for listening.
