Subject:         harkin-chafee

         The Harkin-Chafee-Graham bill contains the language we proposed in
the following areas:

                 l.        Youth look back penalties -- version 1 (p. 43)
                 2.        FDA jurisdiction (p. 61)
                 3.        Licensing and smuggling (p.101)
                           (This section contains only the Treasury language,
but not the                        FDA language.)   (p.101)
                 4.        Document disclosure (p.404)

The bill does not contain our spending or assessment language.

        In addition, the provisions on international tobacco control
funding (p.172) and promotion of tobacco products overseas
("modified-Doggett"; p. 218) appear to be less problematic than the
language contained in the McCain bill.  I will work with Sherman to
further analyze these provisions.

        On the subject of environmental tobacco smoke, the bill does not
propose national standards to promote smoke-free environments, but instead
provides funding to the states for activities related to the reduction of
ETS and education regarding the health risks of ETS (p.216).
