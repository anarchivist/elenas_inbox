TEXT:
Elena -- I'd like to discuss the response from the President to a letter
he received from a group of MOC urging him to establish by E.O. a task
force to create a National Museum on Women's History. You had asked me a
couple of weeks ago to draft the reply.

After discussions with Me I anne , Ellen Lovell and Maria E., my intention is
to draft a response from the President thanking the MOC, and saying that
he has asked the Sec. of the Smithsonian to review this issue and report
back to him about how best to recognize the important contributions that
women have made to our history and culture.

Given that over the past many years, there have been several task forces
created to establish museums with equally laudable goals (Native American
Museum, Latino American Museum), which have not been able to secure
adequate private sector funding, there is some hesitancy to call for yet
another task force.

I have been trying to get a hold of Janet Murguia to run this by her and
have a call into the Smithsonian to see if they think this is an
assignment they would undertake. But realizing that later this week the
event is scheduled on the Hill to dedicate the suffrage statue (which was
done by the same group urging the establishment of this task force), I'd
like to get this done soon.

Does this sound right to you?
