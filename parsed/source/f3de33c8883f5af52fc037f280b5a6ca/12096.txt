TEXT:
We've got Barbara Woolley helping us at finding a social worker or a nurse
for the woman in a non-traditional job. However, it was hard to reach
people today.

Nonetheless, I did talk to a woman who is a childcare worker:

Debbie Watkins, Park Street Children's Center, Rockville, Maryland
Ms. Watkins has a degree from Bowie State College in elementary education,
and she has 15 years experience as a childcare worker, yet she earns about
the same as she did teaching elementary school twenty years ago.   She said
that she could not continue working in this area if she did not have her
husband's income. She said that even if she were single with no children,
she could not really live on her current salary.  She believes that in
order to raise the pay of childcare workers, there should be alternate
funding sources, both governmental and private.

What do you think?
