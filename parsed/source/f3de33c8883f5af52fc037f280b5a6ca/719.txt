 1.      Jean Lambrew has joined the DPC and NEC to work on Health Care
 for Chris J. She will be sitting in Room 209, next to the DPC conference
 room.  Please stop by and say hello. Dorothy, please add Jean to the DPC
 staff list.

 2.      Please remember to CC. Elena on all policy memoranda and E-Mails
 addressed to Bruce R.

 3.      New procedures for Memorandums to POTUS. As I mentioned to some
 of you last week, all Memorandums to the President must include a CC to
 Erskine Bowles. When the memo is ready to go to staff secretary, make
 certain a copy goes to Jason Goldberg in Erksine's office at the same time.

 4.      Please let me know who, if anyone, has not yet been able to take
 advantage of the President's Box at the Kennedy Center.   We will be
 setting up new procedures which hopefully insure that everyone will have
 increased access to these tickets.

  5.      I have a draft copy of the budget in my office. Please feel
  free to come by and xerox pages that you want.  Please remember however,
  this is the only current copy we have.
