EK:

Neal called to say he was a bit late in getting the info to DOJ yesterday,
and that they had a conference call scheduled w/DOJ at 4pm today.  Since
that would be the first they'd be speaking about the issue amongst
themselves, he'd really prefer to do it tomorrow -- anytime.   You've got
some time between 1:30 and 3pm on Friday, so I've suggested that everybody
adjust their schedules and make that work.  I think letting them meet
first is worth the extra half day.

Jose'
