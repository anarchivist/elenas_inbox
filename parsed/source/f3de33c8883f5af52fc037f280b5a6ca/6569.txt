                                      Key Concerns about S. 1415

    The Administration applauds the Commerce Committee's efforts to forge a bipartisan consensus
    to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation this year. To ensure that this effort meets our goals
    of dramatically reducing teen smoking, S. 1415 should be amended as follows:

    Include the Price Increases Needed to Reduce Youth Smoking. In September, the President
    called for a combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by
    up to $1.50 a pack over the next decade as necessary to meet youth smoking reduction targets.
    Research shows that increasing the price of cigarettes is the best way to reduce youth smoking.
    S. 1415 would raise the price by only about $.62 cents per pack when fully phased in.

    Strengthen Penalties Tied to Youth Smoking. The Administration believes legislation should
    impose severe financial penalties on tobacco companies that fail to meet ambitious youth
    smoking reduction targets. S. 1415 should be amended to ensure that the penalties fall both on
    the industry as a whole and on particular companies, that the penalties increase as a result of
    continued or severe noncompliance, and that they are sufficiently high to deter marketing and
    selling tobacco products to minors.

    Reaffirm FDA's Full Authority to Regulate Tobacco Products. The Administration supports
    federal legislation that affirms efforts by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate
    tobacco like any other drug or device and that provides FDA with sufficient flexibility to meet
    changing circumstances. S. 1415 should be amended to make explicit that the FDA has the
    ability to regulate tobacco products as a drug or device, including the ability to regulate
    advertising of such products. At the same time, the amendment could replace the safety and
    efficacy standard for tobacco products with a public health standard.

    Create a Strong Nationwide Licensing System. A strong licensing system is needed to ensure
    compliance with the law forbidding sales of tobacco products to minors, as well as to prevent
    smuggling of tobacco products. This system should run from the manufacturer all the way down
    to the retail level.

    Strengthen International Efforts to Control Tobacco. The Administration strongly believes
    that one of the elements of any comprehensive bipartisan tobacco legislation must be the .
    strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco. In particular, the Administration
    supports efforts to address the health risks associated with tobacco use at an intemationallevel by
    funding multilateral and bilateral efforts.

      Guarantee Broad Document Disclosure. Legislation should provide for broad and expeditious
    . disclosure of tobacco industry documents to the public and the FDA, while preserving
      attorney-client privilege. All disclosure provisions should serve as a supplement to, rather than
      a replacement for, normals ways of obtaining documents in litigation.

    Provide for the Needs of Minority Communities. The Administration believes that there
    should be provisions in comprehensive legislation to address the particular needs of adversely
    effected groups including minorities. These concerns should be addressed by appropriately
    targeting programs in areas such as: counter-advertising, research, provision of health services,
    and prevention and cessation programs.
