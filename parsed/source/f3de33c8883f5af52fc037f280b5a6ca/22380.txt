SPEAKING PROGRAM:
POTUS
FLOTUS (T) -- First Lady's office has not confirmed whether or not she
will participate.   I will let   you know when I find out yes or no.
Sec. Riley
Real Person:     The person it looks like we will hopefully go with is
Arthur Moore, an African-American teacher in the Baltimore School
District. He was in the Army for 20+ years as a staff sergeant, and with
the help of the Troops to Teachers program became a teacher when he
retired.   TTT provided him with a stipend that helped him take the courses
he needed to become a teacher and also to relocate from Colorado to
Baltimore to take a teaching job.   He taught 4th grade for about 2 years,
and for the last 2 years has been teaching middle school special education
classes. He got his bachelors degree in business while in the Army
(through night school), and is currently finishing his masters in special
education.
MEMBERS tbd
         -Leg. Affairs just started reaching out to people this morning,
and does not have a lot of firm info. right now. The one person that has
confirmed, and has also asked to speak, is Rep. Debbie Stabenow.   I think
Communications and Scheduling would prefer to not have to add a lot of


members to the program, but I'll keep you updated on the situation.

Please let me know if there's more info. I can provide for you.   Thanks!
