Here is the current draft of the hate crimes memo.

DRAFT 4-19-97


                                                 April    , 1997

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:      SYLVIA MATHEWS
                   MARIA ECHAVESTE

RE:                  Proposed White House Conference on Hate Crimes



I.         SUMMARY

        This memorandum provides background information relating to hate
crimes in America and proposes that you authorize the convening of a White
House conference on hate crimes to be held in the fall of 1997. This
memorandum also sets forth the goals, structure, timing, staffing and
funding for such a conference.


II.        BACKGROUND

        In January the Executive Committee of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights   (D&LCCRD8) meet with senior White House staff. At the
meeting, LCCR presented its recent report on hate crimes in America. The
report recommends, among other things, that you convene a White House
Conference on hate crimes to help demonstrate the magnitude of the problem
and look for possible solutions. The report points out that D&from
killings and beatings to acts of arson and vandalism, ... hate crimes


injure or even kill thousands of people, terrify countless others, divide
Americans against each other, and distort our entire society.DS

        Statistics collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
suggest that over 8,000 hate crimes occur in America each year.
Moreover, it is generally believed that these statistics greatly
understate the problem.  Crimes of hate are on the rise, even as crimes of
violence are on the decline. The recent incidents of arson at houses of
worship, the abortion clinic bombings and the media attention given to
other incidents of hate related violence, all have helped to focus
national attention on the problem.

        The principal federal statute in this area (18 USC 245) contains a
traditional definition of hate crimes as attacks based on race, religion
or national origin. The Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 expanded that
definition, for the purposes of its provisions, to include crimes in which
an individual becomes the victim due to their race, religion, sexual
orientation, ethnicity or disability. The Hate Crimes Sentencing
Enhancement Act of 1994 expands that definition further to include women.

       You have repeatedly condemned these acts of violence and tried to
focus Americans on ways to find common ground, stressing themes of
unity.


III.    PROPOSED CONFERENCE

        Goals: A White House conference on hate crimes would:

         help to educate the public in a dramatic way about the
substantial threat these crimes pose to us as a nation and how they are at
odds with the fundamental principals of fairness and equal justice we hold
dear as a country;

          demonstrate the AdministrationD,s commitment to preventing hate
crimes and highlight the actions we are already taking to achieve this
goal; and

         serve as a powerful and direct way to communicate to the American
people the seriousness of the situation.

        The theme of the conference should be the impact hate crimes have
on the American society. And while the Reconciliation\Race Initiative
focuses primarily on race, the hate crimes conference would be inclusive
of all victims of crimes motivated by hate, including those motivated by
the actual or perceived religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or
disability of the victim.

        Structure:  The conference would last one day and be held at the White
House.  It would include approximately 100 participants from all walks of
life and from every region of the country. They would be selected by a
White House working group. The participants would include the victims and
their families, advocates, law enforcement professionals, state and local
government officials, Members of Congress, religious leaders, etc.  Senior
Administration officials from the White House, the Attorney General and
other officials from the Department of Justice and relevant agencies and
departments would also participate.

        The conference would include welcoming remarks from the Attorney
General and thereafter the participants would move into smaller groups to


hear several panels focused on different elements of the problem.
Examples could include panels focused on crimes motivated by race,
religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation/identity, disability; the
attackers and organized hate groups; law enforcement efforts and best
practices; educational and private initiatives; help available for the
victims, etc.)  Panel participants would be pre-assigned based on their
area of expertise. Each panel would include an Administration official
and a pre-assigned chair.

        In the afternoon the entire conference would reconvene and hear
remarks from you. We would work to have the afternoon session carried live
on CNN and other networks, and/or by satellite feeds to venues in other
locations. Your remarks would be introduced by a series of brief comments
from victims, whose selection would illustrate the diversity and scope of
the crisis. Your comments would outline the scope of the problem and
suggest the AdministrationD,s response.  After your remarks, the
conference would hear reports from the panel chairs and you would ask
them questions during a round table discussion. A short question and
answer period involving the larger audience would also be included. A
reception for participants could follow.

        A book of the conference proceedings would be produced and
distributed to the participants and others. A letter from you outlining
what can be done to fight hate crimes and including any specific proposals
coming out of the conference could be distributed widely

          Timing:   The conference would take place in the fall of 1997.

        Staffing: The Office of Public Liaison would take the lead in staffing.
A working group to include Public Liaison staff and staff from other
relevant White House Departments (Intergovernmental Affairs, Legislative
Affairs, Cabinet Affairs, Communications, Domestic Policy Council, etc.)
should be assembled to run the conference.

        Funding:  Outside funding, through a not-for-profit foundation or
otherwise, may be available to offset some of the costs and to provide
transportation and lodging for some needy participants.


IV.       RECOMMENDATION

        We recommend that a White House Conference on Hate Crimes be
convened as outlined above.

          Approve          Disapprove                   Discuss further
