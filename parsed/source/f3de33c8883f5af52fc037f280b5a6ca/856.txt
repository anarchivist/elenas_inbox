TEXT:
I gave Jeanine extensive comments on her draft, a revised version of which
she will show you shortly for comment. My overall comment was to assume a
skeptical reader so be as specific as possible about what we have done or
proposed.  I think we'll have a solid draft to distribute by tomorrow's
meeting.  I am staffing the FLOTUS's visit to a DC school tomorrow to
highlight school-law firm partnerships, and can help more extensively
after tomorrow.
