TEXT:
Elena,
The following is my draft of a response to a letter from Alan J. Patricof, who
wrote Potus on product liability.   I've left a lot of the detail out of this
letter, but I want to make sure that it still reflects the Administration's
policy. The President wants to see a draft of this letter as soon as possible,
so if you could please look it over, I would appreciate it.
Here it is:
Thank you very much for your letter regarding the Product
Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996.   I appreciate having your
perspective on this issue.
I vetoed this legislation because it would deprive American
families of their ability to recover fully from injuries caused
by defective products. This bill inappropriately intrudes on
state authority in the interest of protecting manufacturers and
sellers of harmful products, and unfairly tilts the legal playing
field against consumers.   I understand your concerns about
frivolous lawsuits and their affects on corporate America and on
our nation's legal system. However, I cannot accept legislation
that would undermine the ability of courts to provide relief to
victims of harmful products, and thereby endanger the health and
safety of the entire American public.   I'm eager to sign
legislation to improve our nation's legal system, but as I've
stated repeatedly to Congress, any product liability legislation
must fairly balance the interests of consumers with those of
manufacturers and sellers.
I'm grateful, as always, for your thoughtful insight, and I
appreciate your taking the time to write.
                         ###
thanks,
Jeff
