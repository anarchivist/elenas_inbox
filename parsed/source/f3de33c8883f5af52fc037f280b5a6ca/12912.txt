NRA Tries to Rally Lawmakers

                            By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pointing toward a House
                            showdown, the National Rifle Association is
trying to rally
                            lawmakers against Senate-passed legislation that
requires
                            background checks for all firearms buys at gun
shows.

                            The issue, expected on the House floor by
midmonth, is --the
                            most critical gun vote in over five years, "   the
NRA said in a
                            recent mailing urging its members to contact
their
                            representatives at the Capitol.

                            The legislation would --impose a cradle-to-grave
massive
                            federal regulatory scheme on gun owners
throughout America
                            -- and that's no exaggeration,"   said the
mailing, which
                            requested $35 to $85 for membership renewals. A
copy was
                            made available to The Associated Press.

                            The appeal was crafted in the days after the
proposal and
                            squeaked through the Senate on the strength of a
tie-breaking
                            vote cast by Vice President Al Gore.

                            House GOP leaders have agreed to allow
gun-control
                            legislation to the floor next week. Aides said
that no decision
                            has been made whether to have the Judiciary
Committee


                              consider the issue before the full House votes.

                              Gun control became a pressing political issue
 after the April
                              shootings at a Colorado high school in which two
 student
                              gunmen killed 12 fellow students and a teacher
 before turning
                              their weapons on themselves.

                              With public polls indicating a surge in support
 for gun control,
                              President Clinton responded with a call for
 fresh restrictions. In
                              a political debacle for the majority
 Republicans, the Senate
                              adopted some of them last month in broader
 legislation relating
                              to juvenile crime.

                              The Senate-passed measure requires instant
 background
                              checks for all gun-show purchases, closing what
 supporters
                              said was a loophole that.permitted some
 transactions to
                              proceed without checks. In addition, it outlawed
 importation of
                              large-capacity ammunition clips, required the
 sale of safety
                              locks with handguns and barred juveniles with
 felony
                              convictions from ever buying guns.

                              The outcome in the House is unpredictable, aides
 in both
                              parties said. While Republicans hold a 222-211
 majority, with
                              one Democratic-leaning independent, Democrats
 sayan
                              estimated two dozen to three dozen members of
 their rank and
                              file, mostly those from rural areas, can be
 expected to oppose
                              some gun-control proposals. Likewise, a similar
 number of
                              Republicans, principally those from the
 northeast, can be
                              expected to embrace gun control.

                              The NRA letter says the gun show provision will
 "form the
                              basis for a national gun registration scheme all
 across America.
                              It's so ridiculous it could extend the
 definition of gun shows to
                              mean your home.

                              " I t gives the federal government open-ended
 authority to issue


                      phone book-size volumes of new federal red tape
  on
                      Americans who buy and sell firearms."

                      Supporters of the measure say it would merely
  require all
                      purchasers at gun shows to submit to an instant
 background
                      check. Current law exempts some purchasers.
