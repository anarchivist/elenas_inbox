Note the second paragraph. This one is always fun to kick them on (tho
looks like Dems are vulnerable) .

VH-I:     NOT MTV
        Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke out on Pres. Clinton's
,
    participation in VH-l's music special, "Bill Clinton: Rock & Roll
    President" (see HOTLINE, 6/4). Gingrich: "It was very
    disheartening to see the president have an entire hour with young
    people, on a channel dedicated to young people, and not mention a
    single word about opposing drug use, about avoiding drug use,
    about the dangers of drug use . . . . Somebody really let the ball
    drop in a big way." WH Press Sec. Mike McCurry at a press
    briefing: "VH-l tends to skew their audience share more to the
    age of people in this room.  But maybe the Speaker, if he didn't
    know that, maybe someone on his staff will educate him further"
    ("IP," CNN, 6/4).
         MEANWHILE IN CONGRESS:  Five months after the House agreed
    to begin drug testing lawmakers and their staffs, "no testing has
    been done and new legislation may be needed to get it under way."
    Testing has been stalled because of "questions of its legality
    and the opposition of many" Dems -- including Min. Leader Dick
    Gephardt.  Supporters "say drug testing would subject House
    members and staff to the same workplace rules faced by many
    Americans in the private sector." Nearly 400,000 fed. employees,
    including cabinet secretaries, "are already subject to random
    drug tests." Opponents, like some Capitol Hill staff, have
    "openly vowed to challenge" its constitutionality (O'Connell,
    SCRIPPS HOWARD/FAIRFAX JOURNAL, 6/5).
