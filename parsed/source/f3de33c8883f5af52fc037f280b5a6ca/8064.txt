"              DISCIPLINE AND PROTECTING OTHER CRITICAL INVESTMENTS
                                                            June 9,1998


    Today, President Clinton will sign an IS TEA Reauthorization Bill That Includes An Historic Investment
    in Infrastructure While Maintaining Fiscal Discipline and Protecting Critical Investments, Such As
    Education, the Environment, and Health Care. While providing an historic investment in our infrastructure,
    the agreement maintains President Clinton's priorities of reserving the surplus until Social Security is reformed
    and investing in critical areas such as education, the environment, and health care. In response to the concerns
    the Administration raised, Congress improved the bill and the agreement now represents a solid compromise
    that is consistent with President Clinton's core principles:

           '(Strengthens Our Infrastructure. The agreement guarantees nearly $200 billion to continue
           rebuilding America's transportation system -- an approximately 30-percent increase over the 1991 ISTEA
           reauthorization. This agreement will help communities modernize and build the roads, bridges,
           railways, and buses that link the people of our great and vast country together, that keep our economy
           strong and vibrant.

           ,(Maintains Fiscal Discipline. The agreement cuts the increase in excess transportation funding in half
           -- reducing it by $17 billion from the extra spending levels that were included in the original
           Congressional bills -- even though those bills had passed the House and Senate by large majorities.

           ,( Preserves Surplus Until Social Security Is Reformed. Unlike the original Congressional bills, the
           compromise is fully paid for with real offsets. And because the agreement does not touch the surplus, it
           is fully consistent with the President's call to "Save Social Security First."

           ,( Protects Critical Investments in Our Future. Unlike the original,Congressiorial bills, the transportation
           agreement does not squeeze other critical investments in our future, such as education, health care,

                                                                              ,
           research and development, and the environment, because it is not financed by lowering the discretionary
                                                                                                                          =>
      THIS HIGHWAY-TRANSIT BILL AGREEMENT ALSO REFLECTS PRESIDENT CLINTON'S
                                                                                        .                                 ~

           ,( Expands Transit Funding Within A Smaller Bill. While the agreement has less overall spending than the
           original Congressional bills, it increases the share of transit funding from 17 percent of total surface
           transportation spending to 20 percent of total spending by 2002.
      public health and the environment by increasing funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
      Improvement program 75 percent by FY2000.

      "'Helps Move People from Welfare to Work. One of the biggest barriers facing people who move
      from welfare to work -- in cities and in rural areas -- is finding transportation to get to jobs, training
      programs and child care centers. To help those on welfare get to their jobs, the highway-transit
      agreement authorizes $900 million over the next six years for President Clinton's welfare-to-work
      transportation plan. Of the $150 million per year, $50 million is guaranteed in FY99, rising to the full
      $150 million per year guaranteed in FY2003.

      "'Helps Disadvantaged Businesses. The highway-transit agreement provides opportunities to
      disadvantaged businesses by retaining the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business
      Enterprise (DBE) program.

      "'Extends the Ethanol Tax Credit. In order to provide incentives to use ethanol in gasoline and
      protect the environment, the highway-transit agreement extends the Ethanol Tax Credit through FY2007.

      "'Strengthens Border Infrastructure. The highway-transit agreement authorizes the Administration's
      program to target resources to border crossings to improve traffic flow and reduce illicit trade. The
      agreement allows highway funding to be used for Customs and INS equipment that speeds border
      crossings.

While the Agreement Provides Funding For Increased Safety, It Does Not Include A National Drunk
Driving Standard of .08 BAC. The agreement includes a number of measures to increase safety, including
incentive grants to increase seat-belt use, new measures to target repeat drunk drivers and to ban open alcohol
containers in cars, and a strong program to make highway-rail grade crossings safer. However, the President is
disappointed that Congress refused to lower the national drunk driving standard to .08 percent blood alcohol
content (BAC). The President will continue to work to make sure that .08 is the law in every state of the
country.
