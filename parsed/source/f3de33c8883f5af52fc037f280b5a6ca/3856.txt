TEXT:
There is some interesting stuff being developed in the DOJ hate crimes
group which will go fine with the conference in November, but may suggest
a closer connection eventually with the race intitiative ... it may even be
stuff the intitiative is doing.

For instance, DOJ is looking to put together hate crime task forces
structured around the 90 or"so US Attorneys. The groups will include
local and federal prosecutors, the FBI, but also local advocacy
groups,private sector,  and perhaps educators.   (Something like 65% of
hate crimes are commited by teenage white males). Department of education
has a curriculum ready ("Healing the Hate") and DOJ is helping to get a
curriculum to train local police in dealing with hate crimes.   If we moved
it into prevention and punishment it begins to look like the President is
coordinating a strategy to deal with the most virulent outgrowths of
prejudice in a tough, sensible, regionally based manner. maybe, maybe
not:
