FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      JANUARY 5, 1998

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The Senate and House will meet at noon tomorrow, Wednesday January 6, 1999
to convene the 106th Congress.

The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Readiness Issues
today. All Military Department Chiefs testified. A summary of the hearing
will be forwarded shortly.

CONGRESS -- THIS WEEK:

SENATE
Senate Democrats are scheduled to caucus in private at 9 a.m. on Jan. 6 in
the Capitol, three hours before the Senate convenes.   Lott is expected
either to call for a similar private caucus or to meet with other GOP
leaders Wednesday morning, as well.

The Senate will convene at Noon on January 6.  Following the prayer, the
Vice President will give the oath of office to new and returning senators
in alphabetical order.   No legislative business scheduled.

The Senate impeachment trial is still expected to begin next week.
Regarding introduction of legislation, the most recent notification to
Members was that bills could be introduced on the 19th.

HOUSE
The House is expected to convene at noon on January 6th and following the
action discussed below is expected to recess until the State Of The Union
on January 19th. The first votes are expected on the 20th.

 At noon tomorrow, the House will proceed to a quorum call. Following the
quorum call,  the House will elect its speaker (Hastert) - then the House
members will be sworn in by the new speaker.

Next, the House will consider a rules package which will be debated for
one hour and voted en bloc. The rules changes include language allowing
the House Government Reform Committee to retain its Census Subcommittee.
The proposed rules would also extend the life of the select committee
established last year to investigate technology transfers to China.
Another provision would authorize the Budget Committee to publish FY99
spending allocation numbers in the Congressional Record that O&shall be
effective in the House as though established by passage of a concurrent
budget resolution for FY99".

Finally, the Government Reform & Oversight Committee and the House
Oversight Committe~ would be renamed as the Government Reform Committee
and the House Administration Committee, respectively. The rules would


    revert the National Security Committee back to its former name, the Armed
    Services Committee.

    The House Democrats will offer an alternative rules package.  This package
    is expected to fail on a party line vote.  One item in the package would
    create a new point of order against using any Social Security surplus or
    anyon-budget surplus until Social Security is in actuarial balance.

    Also, the House must reappoint the managers of the impeachment trial in
    the Senate. This may be a part of the Rules package or it may be a
    separate vote.

    House Democrats have a caucus tentatively scheduled for Wednesday morning.
    House Appropriations Democrats are hoping to appoint members to
    subcommittees this week but the majority has not yet given the
    subcommittee ratios. It is therefore on hold until that is finalized.
