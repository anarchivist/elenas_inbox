   TEXT:
           DOJ is planning to propose Title IX regulations for the 25 federal
   agencies that now have none. In addition, DOJ is drafting regulatory
   language to address a 1988 amendment to Title IX sponsored by Senator
   Danforth. The primary purpose of the amendment was to prevent Title IX
   from being applied so as to require colleges receiving federal funds to
   cover abortion services in a health insurance plan or to furnish abortions
   in their facilities. However, the Danforth amendment was ambiguous as to
   the applicability of Title IX in the extreme cases when the life of the
   woman is threatened by pregnancy or when medical complications arise from
   an abortion.

           The text of the amendment provides in part: "Nothing in [Title IX)
   shall be construed to require or prohibit any person, or public or private
   entity, to provide or pay for any benefit or service, including the use of
   facilities, related to an abortion." Floor statements in both the Senate
   and House indicate that several Members did not interpret the amendment to
   extend to the extreme cases described above. DOJ has concluded that the
   Danforth amendment, and the associated legislative history, are not suffic
   iently clear to arrive at a certain conclusion as to congressional intent
   on this point.

          Because of the strong argument that the Danforth amendment does
  not apply to those cases, and the principle that recipients of federal
  funds should not make gender-based distinctions in providing benefits, DOJ
  plans to forward regulations that state expressly Title IX does apply in
  those extreme cases. I am inclined to agree with their analysis and to
  suggest that DOJ forward their proposed regulations in that form. If any
  of you would like to discuss this or to meet with DOJ staff, please let me
  know.
