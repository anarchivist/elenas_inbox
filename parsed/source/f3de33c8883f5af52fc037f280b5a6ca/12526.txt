BR/EK:

Here's a quickie statement on the Senate's gun bill intro today ... It's a
little dry.

I've mentioned the Members leg. affairs told us about, but we should make
sure the list works for them.

                          The Youth Gun Crime Enforcement Act

        I want to thank Senators Schumer, Feinstein, Durbin, Kennedy, and Boxer for introducing
our proposals to help keep guns and explosives out of the hands of kids and criminals. I also
want to thank Representative Conyers, who will soon introduce the same proposals in the House.
 This legislation will require Brady background checks at gun shows, raise the age for owning a
handgun from 18 to 21 years of age, and help law enforcement trace even more crime guns to
their source. It will also do more to strengthen enforcement of our gun laws. These are
common sense proposals that should be supported by gun owners and advocates alike, and
Congress should consider them as soon as possible.
