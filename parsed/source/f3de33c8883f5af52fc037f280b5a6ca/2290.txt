       On Friday, a Federal judge issued a temporary restraining order allowing managed care plans to
       defer submitting bids for a new competitive pricing demonstration in Denver. As a result, these
       plans will be permitted to wait until the judge makes a final ruling on whether to make this a
       permanent restraining order. The final ruling is expected to be on June 12. This restraining
       order represents at least a temporary setback for the Administration's attempts to establish a
       market-oriented bidding process within the Medicare program.

       Under current law, we are, on average, actually losing money for each enrollee who signs up for
       Medicare managed care. Despite the fact that we pay 95% of our average fee-for-service costs
       on payments to managed care plans, these payments are excessive because plans (whether
       purposefully or not) are attracting disproportionately healthy beneficiaries ..

       For the last two years we have been trying to set up a competitive bidding demonstration within
       Medicare to test the theory that the program would save money if it purchased health care more
       like the private sector. Not surprisingly, despite its rhetoric that Medicare should be more like
       the private sector, the managed care industry is quite satisfied with the current reimbursement
       structure and fights us every time we either try to inject competition into the program or in any
       other way try to address the current overpayment problem.

       The industry usually wins the battle of public relations in these demonstration debates because
       they argue that competitive pricing will force them to reduce the extra benefits that they currently
       provide to beneficiaries. (Interestingly, before the ruling, a few plans secretly submitted bids for
       a benefit plan that mirror the benefits that most HMOs are currently offering in Denver; each of
       the bids came in below the rates we are now paying plans.)

       At a time when we are being inaccurately criticized for our reluctance to advocate long overdue
       structural reforms to Medicare, this somewhat public feud with the industry may help us win
       points with the elite validators who heretofore have been criticizing us. Retired Senator Dave
       Durenberger has already offered to do whatever he can to help us highlight the inconsistencies of
       the industry's position. As a Republican who has consistently advocated a market-oriented
       approach to managed care purchasing, he could help us make our case. We are thinking about
       raising this issue with other validators as well and will keep you informed as further
       developments arise.
