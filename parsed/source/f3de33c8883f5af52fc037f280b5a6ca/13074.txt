I have incorporated the suggestions I received on the "one-pager"
that was distributed at last week's Choice Working Group meeting.
As you may recall, the one-pager is to be distributed outside for


use in newsletters, etc. Unless anyone has objections or
additional suggestions, the attached file is it!  Please get
comments to me by tomorrow (Wednesday).
Also, we need to decide under whose byline the one-pager will be
distributed.  Please get suggestions on that to me by tomorrow as
well.

        Republicans In Congress are using the complicated budget process to launch a stealth
attack on the reproductive health of American women. The House and Senate have already
passed more than a dozen anti-choice provisions in committee and on the floor ·

.Both the House and the Senate voted to restrict federal employees from choosing a health plan
        that includes coverage for abortion services -- including, under the House version, in
        cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.

.The House has also voted to:

       .Deny poor women access to abortions under Medicaid even if they are victims of rape
              and incest -- causing additional suffering for victims of sexual violence .

       .Restore the ban on privately-funded abortion services in military hospitals, threatening
              the quality of the medical care available to servicewomen and women in military
              families -- especially those stationed in countries where abortion is illegal, the
              blood supply unsafe, and sterile conditions and reliable physicians difficult to
              come by.

       .Deny all funding to any family planning organization that provides abortion services
              overseas or attempts to influence governmental policy on abortion .

       .Undermine the requirement that ob/gyn residency programs provide training in abortion
             procedures -- even though current standards already exempt programs and
             residents with religious and moral objections to abortion.

·In addition, the House Appropriations Committee voted to defund the federal family planning
       program. Recognizing that eliminating a program that provides family planning services
       to millions of women is the wrong way to make abortion less necessary, moderate
       Republicans joined with Democrats to narrowly defeat this proposal on the House floor.

        In contrast to the Congressional majority, the President has acted to protect
women's reproductive health from his very first week in office. He signed a host of
executive orders -- now in jeopardy -- that protected servicewomen and international family
planning efforts, repealed the "Gag Rule" that restricted abortion counseling at federally funded
family planning clinics, ended the ban on funding of fetal tissue research, and revoked the import
ban on RU-486. The President also signed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act to
fight violence and intimidation against women and their doctors. And he has worked to make
abortion rare as well as safe and legal by calling for a National Campaign Against Teen
Pregnancy, proposing sensible welfare reforms, and requesting increases for the federal family
planning program each year he has been in office.

     Now American women must get involved to stop the Congressional majority's war on
women. Making our voices heard has never been more important than it is today.
