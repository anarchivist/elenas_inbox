TEXT:
Elena,

Ellen Vargyas from the EEOC would like for us to meet with some of the key
people in her office to discuss the budget initiative.  Her interest is in
ensuring that all of the folks over there understand our package and can
speak about it positively with the press, staff and others. According to
Ellen, this is particularly important with the Acting Chair's staff
(Igasaki). Tom and I will likely both attend this meeting, which is
tentatively.scheduled for Tues. at noon.  Thanks.

Julie
