Bruce/Elena/Rahm:

Per my conversations w/Bruce and Elena today, attached please find the
Brady languaged you requested.  OMB, DOJ and DPC have all seen it, and can
live with it -- and, based on my discussion w/Handgun Control, I think
they'll be fine with it, too.

In short, the language would: (1) prohibit a fee for the next fiscal year;
(2) allow records to be retained for 3 months; (3) provide for a
transition period through 6/99; and (4) guarantee that NICS records are
used only to ensure the integrity of the system.
