TEXT:
Gov. Lowry has made an interesting request of USDA that they want
to reject tomorrow at noon.   He has asked USDA to sell him food
stamps for legal immigrants who are losing eligibility, and he
promises to reimburse USDA for the cost.   His theory is that this
is easier than establishing ·some new state voucher for this
purpose.
USDA is pretty convinced that this is legally an impossibility.
They think the only hope is legislation IF we want to do this
policy-wise -- which they're not sure they want to do.
Questions for us:  Is this something we would want to do?
Politically, we have clearly pushed to soften the impact and offer
states flexibility; but do we want to get into the business of
selling food stamps to all kinds of comers? They are federal food
stamps, and these immigrants are not supposed to get them ....
If we do like this idea, do we want to take a look at USDA's legal
analysis that led them to conclude that this can't be done without
legislation?
To make matters worse, Lowry wants an answer from Glickman by noon
tomorrow -- I think because he is leaving office, with the new
Gov. corning in?!? The new Gov. apparently favors this, but would
rather it were a Lowry proposal.
I will try to learn more about the logistics, but let me know of
any reactions on the policy.
