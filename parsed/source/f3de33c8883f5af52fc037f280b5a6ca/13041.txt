<p>Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:
<p><h3><em>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF SECTIONS. </em></h3>
<p><ul><em>   (a) SHORT TITLE- This Act may be cited as the 'Y2K Act' .</em></ul>

<p><ul><em>  (b) TABLE OF SECTIONS- The table of sections for this Act is as fo
llows:</em></ul>

></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>Sec. 18. Suspension of penalties for certain year 2000 failures
by small business concerns.</em></ul></ul>
<p><h3><em>SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</em></h3>
<p><ul><em>   (a) FINDINGS- The Congress finds that:</em></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (1) (A) Many information technology systems, devices, and progr
ams are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after December 31,
 1999, and will read dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates re
present the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process dates after Decembe
r 31, 1999.</em></ul></ul>               "
<p><ul><ul><em>     (B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph (
A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the
functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, Government, and
  safety and defense systems, in the United States and throughout the world.</em
></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (2) It is in the national interest that producers and users of
 technology products concentrate their attention and resources in the time rema
ining before January 1, 2000, on assessing, fixing, testing, and developing con
tingency plans to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-chang
e problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions associated with computer fai
lures.</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (3) (A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may aff


ect virtually all businesses and other users of technology products to some deg
ree, there is a substantial likelihood that actual or potential year 2000 failu
res will prompt a significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.</
em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>    (B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have a
range of undesirable effects, including the following:</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><em>    (i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial res
ources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 computer date-change problem
s and ensuring that systems remain or become operational.</em></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><em>    (ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted b
usiness and customer relationships that are important to the effective function
ing of the national economy.</em></ul></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><ul><em>    (iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing p
articular problems for the small businesses and individuals who already find th
at system inaccessible because of its complexity and expense.</em></ul></ul></u
1>
<p><ul><ul><ul><em>    (iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control,
adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany litigation of busi
ness disputes could exacerbate the difficulties associated with the date change
 and work against the successful resolution of those difficulties.</em></ul></u
l></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation to
 assure that Y2K problems do ~ot unnecessarily disrupt interstate commerce or c
reate unnecessary caseloads in Federal courts and to provide initiatives to hel
p businesses prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially devastat
ing economic impact of Y2K.</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of Y2K proble
ms is not feasible for many businesses and individuals who already find the leg
al system inaccessible, particularly small businesses and individuals who alrea
dy find the legal system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.</
em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (6) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, adver
se publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany litigation of business
disputes can only exacerbate the difficulties associated with the Y2K date chan
ge, and work against the successful resolution of those difficulties.</em></ul>
</ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (7) Concern about the potential for liability--in particular,
concern about the substantial litigation expense associated with defending agai
nst even the most insubstantial lawsuits--is prompting many persons and busines
ses with technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year 2000 comput
er date-change problems.</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (8) A proliferation of frivolous Y2K lawsuits by opportunistic
 parties may further limit access to courts by straining the resources of the 1
egal system and depriving deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relie
f.</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (9) Congress encourages businesses to approach their Y2K dispu
tes responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-consuming and costly litigation
 about Y2K failures, particularly those that are not material. Congress support
s good faith negotiations between parties when there is a dispute over a Y2K pr
oblem, and, if necessary, urges the parties to enter into voluntary, nonbinding
 mediation rather than litigation.</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><em>   (b) PURPOSES- Based upon the power of the Congress under Article I
, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the purposes of
 this Act are--</em></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all busines
ses and users of technology products reasonable incentives to solve Y2K compute
r date-change problems before they develop;</em></ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (2) to encourage continued Y2K remediation and testing efforts
 by providers, suppliers, customers, and other contracting partners;</em></ul><
/ul>


<p><ul><ul><em>   (3) to encourage private and public parties alike to resolve Y
2K disputes by alternative dispute mechanisms in order to avoid costly and time
-consuming litigation, to initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and t
o encourage the prompt identification and correction of Y2K problems; and</em><
/ul></ul>
<p><ul><ul><em>   (4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by discouragi
ng insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the ability of individuals and busin
esses that have suffered real injury to obtain complete relief.</em></ul></ul>
