TEXT:
The President is doing a press conference Wednesday with Havel.  I am
looking for guidance from you guys on anything that might come up in your
area. He's only taking 4 (hopefully) questions so we think most of the
questions will be on other topics.

Leg Affairs and NEC have handled budget, approps, etc. please e-mail Lori
Anderson by 11 am with any other q and a you think we may need (bill of
rights, maybe?).

Thanks.
