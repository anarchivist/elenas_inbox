Subject:         HUD Moving to Work Demo

This demonstration program is intended to allow housing authorities to
"design and test ways to give incentives to families to become
economically self-sufficient, achieve programmatic efficiencies and reduce
costs, and increase housing choice for low-income households".
Participating housing authorities (about 24) are supposed to gain
flexibility and be exempt from many of the housing rules so they can test
innovative ideas like time limits, flat rent, linking their policies to
welfare reform strategies etc. On a recent visit to California, Michael
Deich heard an earful about how the BUD field offices were being extremely
rigid and bureaucratic in negotiating conditions with the demonstration
sites. This defeats the whole purpose of the demo, to encourage
much-needed innovation and experimentation in housing policy. Assuming
you agree, Deich wants to call Cuomo and encourage him to get the word out
to his field staff to get with the program.
