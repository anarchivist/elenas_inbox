SUBJECT:               ANNUAL REPORTS ON HATE CRIMES IN SCHOOLS AND
                       COLLEGE CAMPUSES

        One of the greatest challenges facing this country in the 21 st century is to create a vision
of One America where the American Dream is alive and well for every citizen responsible
enough to work for it. We all must work together to ensure that all Americans share the same
opportunities, regardless of their race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender,
or disability.

       Tragically, however, our nation has witnessed a number of heinous and cowardly hate
crimes, particularly in the past year. These shameful acts of violence are attacks not only against
individuals, but against America and our shared values. Violence motivated by prejudice and
hatred hurts us all.

        We have a responsibility to ensure that our nation's laws fully protect all its citizens.
That is why I support legislation which would strengthen existing federal hate crimes laws to
remove needless barriers to prosecuting violent crimes based on race, color, religion, or national
origin; and to expand the law to cover acts of violence committed because of a person's sexual
orientation, gender, or disability.

        However, we must not focus only on acts of intolerance and hate once they rise to the
level of a crime. We can only fight prejudice by fighting the misunderstanding and the
ignorance that produce it. This type of insidious hate is learned behavior. We must reach out
to children and young people in order to teach them about the harmful effects of intolerance.
Often intolerance begins with a bigoted remark or a lack of sensitivity toward individual
differences. It begins with the taunting of children and young people because of their skin color,
religion, sexual orientation, or disabilities. Parents and teachers must create an ongoing
dialogue to change attitudes and to highlight positive ways in which to deal with diversity. Just
as hate is not learned in only one day, attitudes about tolerance cannot be created with one lesson
or discussion -- they must be interwoven into young people's daily lives.

       In order to better understand the problem of hate crimes and intolerance among young
people, I call on the Departments of Justice and Education to include in their annual report card
on school safety a section on hate crimes and intolerant behavior among young people, both at
school and away from school. In addition, I direct the Department of Education, with
appropriate assistance from the Department of Justice, to collect data and produce a report on
incidents of hate crime and attitudes of bias for college on college campuses.

       These steps, taken together and in coordination with our pending legislation, will help to
create One America for all of America's families. I appreciate your commitment to improving
the enforcement of this nation's laws and to working to teach tolerance among young people, and
                                                                       Hex-Dump COirv'e:Slon
I look forward to your continuing leadership in these areas.
