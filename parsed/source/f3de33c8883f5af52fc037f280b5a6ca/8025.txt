Q:   What is your reaction to the passage of Proposition 227 in California?

A.   The most important message coming from voters in California is that we have to make
     sure that students, particularly those who are immigrants or children of immigrants,
     learn English as quickly as possible. I agree with that message, though I disagres with
     the. particular approach in Proposition 227.

     I opposed the Unz Initiative because it is the wrong way to accomplish this goal. The
     one-year time limit is simply too short for many students, and the one-size-fits all
     approach wi1llimit the ability of local communities and schools to choose the best
     approaches forour children.

     But the status quo is not acceptable either. That is why I believe we must set a goal of
     helping students learn English within 3 years, give our schools the flexibility and
     assistance necessary to meet that goal, and hold them accountable if they fail to do so.
     We also have a shortage of well prepared teachers. That is also why I have asked
     Congress to double funding for training teachers who help students learn English, from
     $25 million to $50 million. No approach will work without well trained teachers, but a
     number of approaches can work well with good teachers.

Q.   How do you explain that so many Latinos in California voted for Prop 227 in spite
     ofthe President's opposition?

A.   Many Latino parents are dissatisfied with the educational opportunities available to their
     children -- as they should be. Many feel that it takes too long for their children to master
     English. That is why we have called for strengthening bilingual programs by increasing
     funding for bilingual teachers and by establishing a three year goal for all children to
     move into all-English classes. We believe this approach is preferable to Proposition 227.

Q.   Will you support legislation currently in Congress (the Riggs bill) to overhaul the
     federal bilingual education program?

A.   I oppose the Riggs bill. Among other problems, its requirement that schools teach kids
     English within 2 years or lose all of their funds, is too punative and will not help
     students learn English. In addition, it eliminates federal support for teacher training,
     does not provide appropriate flexibility to schools and it interferes with the enforcement
     of existing civil rights laws. Efforts to strengthen the federal bilingual education
     program should instead (1) set a goal for students to learn English within 3 years; (2)
     hold schools accountabile for results; (3) provide local flexibility for determining how.
     best to achieve results; and (4) make the necessary investments in providing qualified
     teachers. I will send legislation to Congress fully consistent with these principles at
     an appropriate time.

    Q:   Will the Administration join those who are planning to bring legal action to stop the
         implementation of Proposition 227?
                                                                    ,
    A.   We are not at this time joining in legal challenges to Proposition 227. The Departments
         of Justice and Education will carefully monitor the educational programs that are put in
         place under the proposition to ensure that they comply with the civil rights laws. Whether
         they do so will depend upon how they are implemented and whether children with limited
         English proficiency are provided a realistic opportunity to succeed academically.
