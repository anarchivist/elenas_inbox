Yesterday, I circulated for review and comment a Justice Department letter

on

HR 3862, the Child Custody Protection Act, which would make it illegal to

transport minors across state lines for the purpose of avoiding state

parental

involvement laws.     The letter is to be transmitted prior to the House

Committee

on the Judiciary's markup of HR 3862, which is scheduled to resume on

Tuesday,

June 23rd.     JUSTICE WOULD LIKE CLEARANCE OF ITS LETTER TODAY.



please let me know by 1:00 p.m. today if you are going to have any

comments to

the Justice letter.    NOTE:   The Justice letter was promised to the

Committee in

Chief-of-Staff Bowles' June 17th letter to Rep. Hyde on this legislation.



Thanks.
