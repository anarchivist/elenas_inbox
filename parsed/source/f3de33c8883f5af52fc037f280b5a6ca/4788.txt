Subject:         Civil Rights proposals for OMBs Review

To give OMB time to consider incorporating recommendations into the
Director's crosscut review on civil rights that may result from Elena's
outreach and agency meetings, Michael suggests that we need to receive
initial proposals by November 4th.  Could you please pass this along to
those who need to know?

Thanks.    See you tomorrow.
