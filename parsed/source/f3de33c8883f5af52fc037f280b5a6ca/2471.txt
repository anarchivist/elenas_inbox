                            STATEMENT ON TOBACCO DOCUMENTS
                                 FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT
                                       JUNE 30, 1998


             But before we begin, I want to comment on a recent development, by using some of the
     plainest language I know: Smoking Kills. Just this past weekend we found even more evidence
     to prove that the tobacco companies have been targeting our children for decades -- a Lorillard
     document from 1978 state bluntly: the "base of our business is the high school student."

           Let me say on behalf of President Clinton that the base of our business is protecting
     Americas children. That is why the President and have been working so hard to pass
     comprehensive tobacco legislation to reduce youth smoking and save one million precious lives.

             The tobacco company documents revealed over the weekend only reinforce what we have
     seen in hundreds of other documents released in the past several months which confirm that for
     decades: the tobacco industry did intense research on the smoking habits of children as young as
     12, the tobacco companies knew their product was addictive and deadly, tobacco companies
     knew a price increase would drive down the number of young people smoking and that tobacco
     companies have continued to market their products to young people.

            In one 1984 RJR document entitled "Younger Adult Smokers: Strategies and
     Opportunities" they say young adult smokers are "the only source of replacement smokers." A
     1987 Philip Morris memo states "It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking
     prevalence ofteenagers." Another RJR document from 1973 states that "many manufacturers
     have "studied" the 14-20 year-old market in hopes of uncovering the "secret" ofthe instant
     popularity some brands enjoy."

            These outrageous and immoral actions by the tobacco industry aimed at our kids is why
     the President and I have worked so hard to reduce youth smoking. The President and I worked
     with Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to: raise the price of cigarettes, stop tobacco
     companies from marketing to kids, invest in anti-smoking programs and research and give kids a
     healthy future.

             The President and I strongly believe that high school students should not be the base of
     business for the tobacco industry and neither should Congress. The President and I will
     continue to expose the deceptions and lies of the tobacco industry through these documents and
     not stop until comprehensive legislation is passed by Congress and signed into law by the
     President.
