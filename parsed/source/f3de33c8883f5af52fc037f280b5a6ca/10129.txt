TEXT:
Comunity colleges have already expressed lots of interest in the $5
million program for the current year--AACC says they've gotten more
inquiries on this than on any other new initiative in a long time.   Child
care on site would also help welfare recipients combine work and
education, and make it easier for people to use campus work study to
fulfill work requirements for those attending college.
