TEXT:
Monahan is saying that they don't want to discuss Calif. situation
much at Monday's meeting.  He says there are a lot of complex
financial issues in the state plan, and we should discuss it
later.  Plus, they don't plan action on it for a few weeks.
I just left him a message saying that we don't need to have a
fulsome discussion of Calif's entire plan, but that Elena was
interested in Harriet's read on what in the law makes this even a
possibility; and that, since other states (NJ, maybe NY) may be
picking up on this theme in the coming days and weeks, this does
merit some earlier focus.
