         S.1205 -- MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 2000
                   (Sponsors: Stevens (R), Alaska; Bums (R), Montana)


       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on S. 1205,
the Military Construction Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the Senate
Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the Administration's views would be
appreciated.

Section 129: Bluegrass Chemical Demilitarization Facility

        The Administration strongly opposes section 129, which would require the demonstration
of six alternative technologies to chemical weapons incineration before construction of the
Chemical Demilitarization facility at Bluegrass, Kentucky, could begin. Prompt construction of
the Bluegrass site is critical to ensuring U.S. compliance with the deadline for chemical weapons
destruction agreed to under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Department of Defense
has demonstrated three alternative technologies, one more than required by P.L. 104-208, the
Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. This provision would delay construction of
the Bluegrass site by at least one year, resulting in a breach in the Chemical Weapons Convention
deadline.

Overall Funding Level

        The Administration commends the Committee for developing a bill that funds most of the
 construction projects requested in the President's FY 2000 Budget. However, the
Administration is concerned that the Committee bill, which exceeds the President's budget by
$2.8 billion, will drain critical resources from other programs. The Administration believes that
the President's budget request correctly addresses our most important FY 2000 military
construction and housing needs and that additional funding is not required.

Unrequested Projects

       The Administration questions the Committee's increase of over $650 million to the
President's request for approximately 70 unrequested FY 2000 projects. Though much of the
unrequested funding is for projects that are funded in DoD's Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP), about $125 million is added for projects that are not in DoD's FYDP. While many of
these unrequested projects may have some military utility, they are of much lower priority than
Administration urges the Senate to delete the funding added for unrequested projects, especially
those not in the FYDP.

Restriction on the Use of NATO Security Investment Program Funds

         The Administration objects to section 121 which would prohibit the use of NATO
Security Investment Program (NSIP) funds for Partnership for Peace programs or to provide
support to non-NATO countries. No NSIP funds have been, or are proposed to be, spent on
projects that do not have direct military benefit to the Alliance. Indeed, NSIP-funded proposals
for projects that happen to be located in non-NATO countries must meet the same NATO
military criteria as NSIP projects located in NATO member nations. The Alliance must have the
flexibility to allocate NSIP funds as needed to satisfy NATO military requirements. Restrictions
of the type included in the Committee bill could invite other NATO members to restrict their
NSIP contributions according to narrow national concerns. The restriction could adversely
affect future NATO-led military operations. The Administration urges the Senate to remove this
restriction from the bill.

Family Housing Improvement Fund

        The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's $52.2 million reduction to the
Family Housing Improvement Fund (FHIF). Adequate family housing is critical to recruiting
and retaining a quality force. To supplement existing Military Construction funds to revitalize
DoD's housing inventory in a cost effective and timely manner, the Administration has sought
through privatization to leverage Federal dollars with private sector capital. Subsequent to
submission of the President's budget, the Department reviewed congressional concern over the
scope of its privatization program, and responded by readjusting its proposed FHIF program.
The proposed reduction to this fund would limit the ability of DoD to execute its planned FY
2000 program.

Counter-drug Forward Operating Location Construction

        The Administration objects to the $37.8 million reduction to the $42.8 million request for
Counter-drug Forward Operating Locations. Any delay in funding for new construction at these
locations would reduce our ability to detect, and ultimately intercept, illicit drugs being brought
into the United States. Plans are moving ahead, and this funding is needed now to meet pressing
needs.

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                2

        The Administration urges the Senate to provide the requested transfer authority that
would enable the Secretary of Defense to transfer appropriations among Military Construction
Appropriations Act accounts. Similar transfer authority in Defense Appropriations Acts has
been used with great success to meet unplanned requirements, without reducing the opportunity
for congressional oversight.
