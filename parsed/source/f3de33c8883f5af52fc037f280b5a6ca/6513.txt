MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

SUBJECT:               Steps to Improve Federally-Sponsored Child Care


        Now more than ever, America's working parents struggle to balance their obligations to
be good workers -- and their more important obligations to be good parents. By choice or by
financial necessity, millions of Americans rely on child care to care for their children for part of
each day. Parents deserve to know that their children are safe and nurtured in child care.

        One of my highest priorities is to make child care better, safer, and more affordable.
That is why my balanced budget includes the largest single investment in child care in our
nation's history, and proposes specific measures to improve childcare quality.

         As a supplier of child care and as an employer that must recruit and retain a strong
workforce, the federal government should lead the way in improving child care. I am proud that
our military has developed one of the finest child care delivery systems in the world, and that the
Department of Defense, at my request, is sharing its expertise with the public and private sectors.
 Still, we need to do more. The executive branch of the federal government operates 1,030 child
care centers -- 788 by the military, 109 by the General SerVices Administration, and 133 by other
federal departments. In addition, the military sponsors nearly 10,000 professional family child
care providers. In total, approximately 215,000 children are in our care.

        Today, I am directing my Cabinet to take significant new steps to improve the quality of
federally-sponsored child care in the executive branch by (I) ensuring proper background checks
of workers in eligible, federally-sponsored child care; (II) achieving one hundred percent
accreditation of federally-sponsored child care; (III) exploring partnerships among federal
agencies and with the private sectors to improve child care quality and affordability; and (IV)
ensuring that all federal workers have full information on child care benefits and options
available to them.

        First, I want to ensure that all child care workers in federally-sponsored centers undergo
thorough background checks to make sure they are they are suitable for the job. The vast
majority of child care providers are caring people who have dedicated their lives to teaching and
nurturing children. But one tragedy in child care is too many, and criminal and civil background
checks are important ways to know that the people caring for our children are fit for this
responsibility. Background checks for federal child care workers are required under federal law,
and I want to guarantee that they are being administered appropriately and in a timely fashion.
In addition, I want to make sure that we know as much as we can about what is happening in
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

    federally-sponsored child care by stepping up data collection and maintenance.

            Therefore, today, I am directing Administrator of the General Services Administration
    David Barram to report to me within ninety days with a plan to ensure complete and timely
    background checks, to the fullest extent possible, for all child care workers in non-military,
    federally-sponsored child care settings. Administrator Barram will also report to me on plans to
    improve data collection and maintenance concerning non-military, federally-sponsored child
    care. Agencies with oversight of non-military child care settings will report to the Administrator
    within sixty days on this matter.

            Second, I believe that all federally-sponsored child care should achieve
    nationally-recognized, independent accreditation to ensure and maintain quality. Currently, xx
    percent of eligible, federally-administered child care centers in the executive branch are
    accredited. By the year 2000, I want one hundred percent to be accredited.

            Today, therefore, I am directing Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Administrator
    David Barram to report to me within ninety days with a plan to ensure, to the fullest extent
    possible, independent, nationally-recognized accreditation of all eligible, federally-sponsored
    child care by the year 2000. Agencies with oversight of non-military child care settings will
    report to the Administrator within sixty days on this matter.

           Third, partnerships among federal agencies and with the private sector are an increasingly
    important way to maximize existing resources and improve child care.

            Today, therefore, I am directing Administrator Barram to work with the heads of all
    federal departments and agencies to explore opportunities for collaboration both within
    government and with the private sector to leverage resources to improve child care quality and
    affordability in federally-sponsored settings.

             Finally, I believe that employers have a'reponsibility to make sure that their workers have
    full information on child care and options available to them at the national, state, and local levels.

            Today, therefore, I am directing Director of the Office of Personnel Management Janice
    Lachance to ensure that to the fullest extent possible all federal workers receive full information
    about child care benefits available to them on the federal, state, and local levels, including
    information on resource and referral networks, available tax credits such as the Child and
    Dependent Care Tax Credits and Child Tax Credit, as well as public subsidies. Director
\   Lachance will also host a nationwide summit designed to showcase model public and private
    sector solutions to child care needs.
