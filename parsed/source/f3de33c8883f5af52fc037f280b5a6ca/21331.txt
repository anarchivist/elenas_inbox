                             PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                               RADIO ADDRESS ON CANCER
                                 SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA
                                    September 26,1998

        Good morning. Cancer, as everyone knows, is the cruelest of fates; and it strikes nearly
every family. It struck mine, and I lost my mother to this devastating disease. Stories like these
are the reason why thousands of Americans are coming together today, on the National Mall in
Washington, DC, with one, common purpose: to focus our nation's attention on cancer.
Gathering today are patients and survivors; families and friends; doctors and Americans from all
walks oflife. The Vice President, who has long helped lead the charge in the struggle against
cancer, will join their ranks, and will speak about the specific steps we are taking to win that
fight.

         This morning, I want to talk to you about our overall vision of cancer care and research as
we approach the 21 st century. This is a time of striking progress, of stunning breakthroughs.
With unyielding speed, scientists are mapping the very blueprint of human life, and expectations
of the Human Genome Project are being exceeded by the day. We are closing in on the genetic
causes of breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. New tools for screening and diagnosis
are rewriting patients' medical histories, returning to many the promise of a long and healthy life.
 It is no wonder the scientists say we are turning the comer in the fight against cancer.

        Six years ago, when I committed my administration to help conquer this terrible disease, I
knew there was much to be done. Since then, we have helped cancer patients to keep coverage
when they change jobs. We have accelerated the approval of experimental cancer drugs, and are
working to make them easier for patients to access. We have dramatically increased funding for
cancer research, and, as part of our balanced budget, strengthened Medicare to make the
screening, prevention and detection of cancer more available and more affordable.

       Still, we know that we must build on our progress and never stop searching for the best
means of prevention, the most accurate diagnostic tools, the most effective and humane
treatments -- and, someday soon, a cure. To that end, there are four steps we must take.

        First, I am issuing a challenge to the scientific community: to develop, by the year 2000,
new diagnostic techniques for every kind of cancer. As we unravel the secrets of the human
genome, we must apply that knowledge to the detection of disease. Second, to facilitate new
and better treatments, we must enroll more cancer patients in cutting-edge clinical trials. That is
why we have expanded Medicare to cover the fair costs of those trials for older Americans who
need them most; and that is why I am directing the National Cancer Institute to develop a
national network on clinical trials -- a simple, accessible resource for doctors and patients across


                                                 1
themselves. My administration is committed to having cancer patients fully involved -- not only
in helping shape their own treatment, but in setting research priorities. I am, therefore, directing
the NCI to fully integrate patients and advocates into the policy process and to give due attention
to their unique and critical perspective on the disease. Finally. Congress must pass a Patients'
Bill of Rights, one that ensures privacy, access to specialists and the continuity of care not just to
cancer patients but to all Americans.

        New technological tools; new networks of information; new research priorities: all are
part of our overall approach to health care that puts the patient first. On this day, as Americans
renew our national fight against cancer, we do well to remember that we are doing more than
curing a disease. Weare curing the ills that disease may cause -- the stigmas, the myths, the
barriers to quality care. The concerned citizens on the Mall today show that we are overcoming
those barriers, one by one, and at the same time building a stronger and healthier America.

       Thank you for listening.
