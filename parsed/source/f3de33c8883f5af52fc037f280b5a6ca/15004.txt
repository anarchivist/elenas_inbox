     TEXT:
     It has been called to our attention that many folks are planning to take
     Friday off this week and many offices have inquired about their weekly
     reports.




  Erskine and Sylvia have asked me to issue the following guidance:

 Offices may choose to submit short "hot issues" reports Thursday evening
 in lieu of their more comprehensive Weekly Reports this week, and submit a
 more comprehensive Weekly Report the following week.

  Of course, offices may also choose -- if they desire -- to proceed as
  usual with their Weekly Reports.



  please let me know which your office will be doing.  If your office
  chooses to do the shorter report, we will need it Thursday evening for
  Erskine to read this weekend. Reports turned in after Thursday evening
  will not be read until Monday afternoon.




  THANKS
