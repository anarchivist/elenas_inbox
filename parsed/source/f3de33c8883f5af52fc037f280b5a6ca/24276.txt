DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

April 30, 1998

The Henerable Lamar Smith
Chairman
Subcemmittee en Immigratien
Judiciary Cemmittee
u. S. Heuse .of Representatives
washingten, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

        Teday, yeur Subcemmittee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the O&Workforce
Improvement and Protection Act of 199808 which is intended to address the
grewing demand fer skilled werkers in the infermation technelegy (IT)
industry by enacting a temperary increase in the annual cap en the number
of temporary visas for foreign 0&specialty08 workers under the H-1B
pregram, while alse effecting reforms to the H-1B program that would help
target their usage te industries and empleyers that are actually
experiencing skill shortages.

        The Administratien believes that the first step in increasing the
availability .of skilled werkers must be raising the skills of u.S. werkers
and helping the laber market werk better te match empleyers with u.S.
workers. Therefore, substantial additienal efferts by industry to
increase the skill level .of u.S. werkers and needed imprevements in the
H-1B visa pregram are necessary prerequisites fer the Administratien te
support any shert-term increases in the number .of visas for temperary
fereign werkers.

        We are pleased that H.R. 3736 is censistent with one .of .our
primary objectives, insefar as it cenditiens a temporary increase in the
H-1B cap on the enactment of meaningful reforms te the H-1B visa pregram.
Yeur bill weuld help ensure that no u.S. werker weuld lese their job te a
similarly qualified temperary fereign werker and that every qualified u.S.
werker would have the opportunity te fill a job before a temporary fereign
werker.  Moreever, yeur bill greatly strengthens program requirements and
enforcement te prevent employer abuses .of the H-1B pregram.

        Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 dees net centain any previsien for
additienal training eppertunities fer u.S. werkers.  This training is a
vital cempenent of our strategy to address the leng-term demand for highly
skilled u.s. werkers and to enhance the internatienal cempetitiveness of
impertant u.S. industries. An effective training strategy weuld alse work
te lessen the need for more H-1B visas.  We are also cencerned that the
increase reflected in this bill is large and is not, in any event,
targeted to skill shortages being used te justify this change in pel icy
(i.e., advanced degrees or significant practical experience in math,
science, .or engineering).

        Fer these reasens, the Administration believes that this
legislatien weuld substantially improve the current H-1B pregram and, with
the additien .of meaningful training strategies and a medest reductien in
the level .of increase in the annual cap, would garner the
AdministrationO,s strong support. We look forward te working with the
Congress en these and ether specific provisions in the bill.


         The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no
 objection to the submission of this report from the standpoint of the
 AdministrationO,s program.



 Sincerely,




 Bruce Reed
 Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy




 Gene B. Sperling
 Assistant to the President for Economic Policy
