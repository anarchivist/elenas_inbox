TEXT:
I received a call from Sec. Riley late yesterday seeking my views on the
likelihood of support by Congo Xavier Becerra for a Spanish equivalent
reading test that is available by commercial company. His idea was to
offer this in lieu of the national reading test in English to designated
Spanish speaking students. I agreed to work with Janet Murguia to contact
Xavier to run the idea by him to see if their was sufficient interest to
pursue this with the President as an option BEFORE the Secretary went any
further.  Janet spoke to Xavier last night. He is interested in discussing
this option with us. I reported this to the Secretary. He would like us to
consider how best to get the President's consideration of this option, and
if approved, how best to open discussions with Xavier on it.

Late in my dealings with this issue yesterday, I inadvertantly came across
a memo to the President from Bruce, Mike, and John dated Oct. 2 on this
very subject. The Secretary indicated he had not seen it yet. I read parts
germane to this subject to him by phone. Elena is in today and has agreed
to meet with Maria, Janet, and I to revisit the memo in light of
yesterday's activity. Sec. Riley wants to hear from us today on what next.

Again, I appeal to DPC to keep me, Maria, and Janet in the loop on all
Correspondence related to our national standards and testing initiative.
Each of us has different and important responsibilities to help with this
initiative. I have also alerted the Staff Secretary's office to my
concern. Thanks.
