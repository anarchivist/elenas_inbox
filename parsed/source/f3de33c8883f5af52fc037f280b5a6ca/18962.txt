TEXT:
I know that we just discussed not making the connection between child care
and tobacco as part of our child care talking points to members, but I
wanted to ask you about that.   I know that DeLauro insisted that the
President make the direct connection between a tobacco bill and child care
in his speech in CT, which he did:

      The other thing I want to say that's related to this
is that Congress must pass comprehensive tobacco legislation to
reduce teen smoking and raise the price of cigarettes by up to
$1.50 a pack -- (applause) -- impose strong penalties on
companies that continue to advertise to children, and give the
FDA full authority to regulate tobacco products and children's
access to them.  The revenues we raise from the tobacco company
would help to make a partial contribution to the child care plan
that I have proposed as well.   (Applause.)

Also Children's Defense Fund is concentrating all of their child care
lobbying on tobacco - trying
to get child care included in all the tobacco bills. Does it not make
sense to include a similar line
as part of our legislative strategy on child care? I know there may be a
billion reasons why this
doesn't work, but I thought I'd raise it nonetheless. Thanks--
