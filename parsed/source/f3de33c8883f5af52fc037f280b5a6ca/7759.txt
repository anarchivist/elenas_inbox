TEXT:
BR:

We finally got our hands on a 2-page summary of the Craig-Coverdell drug
proposal.  I'm sending it over right now.   It think it pretty much touches
on all of the things that the R's are likely to touch on. No numbers are
included, but the transcript I sent over earlier says they estimate it
costing about $3 billion. Also, it's not clear that they know where
they're going to get the funds from.   In the transcript, they say some of
this could come out of the existing $16 billion drug budget -- which I
don't think is true -- and Chris from Biden's office expressed that they
may just tack on authorizations --. which I'm not sure makes sense.

We'll keep trying to dig up the actual language for these proposals and
run some numbers on what some of these things may cost.  Without speaking
to the important issue of where the money comes from to fund these
proposals, we should be able to support most of them.

Jose'
