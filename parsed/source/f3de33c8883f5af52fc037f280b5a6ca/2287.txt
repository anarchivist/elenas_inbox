TEXT:
First, thanks for your help on Tuskegee.      Event went great.

The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) holds its final pubic
meeting tomorrow on the cloning report you requested.    NBAC's 90 days
expire May 24, and you are scheduled to receive the report the week of
June 9th.   We expect NBAC to call for a continued moratorium on human
cloning. All commissioners agree that safety concerns alone currently
make cloning human beings unethical, and that a moratorium will not impede
scientific progress. NBAC is divided, however, on whether to recommend
legislation making mandatory the voluntary moratorium you urged for
private research.   Commissioners want an enforceable ban, but some have
little confidence that the legislative process will produce a carefully
and narrowly tailored constraint, or that lawmakers will amend legislation
appropriately as science evolves.   NBAC should resolve this issue over
the next week.
