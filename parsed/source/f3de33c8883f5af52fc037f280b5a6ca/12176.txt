TEXT:
NEC is holding a deputies meeting on labelling tomorrow.   A portion of the
meeting will probably discuss country of origin labelling.   I was going to
check around to see where we were at on this issue.  Last year, when we
discussed it, we didn't make any public statements, either for or against
it.
