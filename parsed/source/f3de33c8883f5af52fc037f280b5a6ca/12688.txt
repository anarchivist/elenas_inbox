Subject:         Re: Here's the tobacco statement Podesta asked us to
draft this morning

The statement looks good.  Please send us your final version as soon as
you can so we can make sure the signing statement and enrolled bill memo
are consistent w/ your final text. Here are our edits:

I am extremely disappointed that the Congress forfeited the federal
governmentD,s taxpayers' claim to the $246 billion tobacco settlement,
without any commitment whatsoever from the states to use a portion of the
settlement funds to prevent youth smoking. Even though 3,000 young people
become regular smokers every day and 1,000 will have their lives cut short
as a result, most states still have no plans to use tobacco settlement
funds to reduce youth smoking.  Congress passed up an important
opportunity to protect our children from the death ~nd diseases caused by
tobacco. This is wrong.   I will closely monitor state efforts in this
area and I will continue to fight for a nationwide effort to reduce youth
smoking through counteradvertising, prevention activities, and
restrictions on youth access to tobacco products.

Our thinking behind the last edit: presently, at least some states have
tobacco control programs in place to reduce youth smoking, so saying they
"have no programs" is inaccurate.

Thanks.
