TEXT:
  Ex-WH CoS Eriskine Bowles (D) "is nearing a decision on whether" to run
for
           gov., "weighing a political career vs. various business
opportunities." Since leaving DC in
           late Oct., "Bowles has been surveying party leaders about a poss
ible" gov. bid in 2000.           '
           He has also "received a number of attractive business offers,
prompting rumors that he is
           giving second thoughts to running" for gov. Bowles: "I haven't
made a decision. I'm not
           having second thoughts on anything. This is a process that I
had planned to go through.
           I haven't found a soul who said that I couldn't be a very good
governor. The reaction my
           candidacy has been very positive . . . . I am not a politician and
never wanted to be one. I
           have to decide whether this is something I can do and do well.
My big question is
           twofold. Can I jam this square peg in a round hole? Can this
nonpolitician go out there
           and be a political candidate? If I get in this race, I want to
win. I am not willing to go
           negative. I don't know if you can win if you don't go
negative." Bowles said he hopes to
           make a decision by Christman, New Year's at the latest. Other
potential Dems: LG
           Dennis Wicker and AG Mike Easley. Potential GOPers ': House GOP
leader Leo
           Daughtry, Raleigh Mayor Tom Fetzer and ex~Charlotte Mayor
Richard Vinroot
