TEXT:
I suggest'we get together to discuss the structure and next steps of    a
tobacco plan on Monday.

After we meet, there are at least two meetings I'd like to set up for
early next week:

1. Legislative Strategy with Hilley.   Small meeting with leg. affairs to
discuss most effective way to get bill to floor.

2.   General Strategy. Smallish meeting with Penn, Rahm, strategy types
to discuss political strategy as issue moves along.

The steps after that should be half taking care of business internally
(setting up regular coordination meetings, hiring a staffer, consulting
with health and AG groups, drafting a memo for Erskine, etc.),   and half
pushing the agenda legislatively and via events and communications.

Regards, Tom
