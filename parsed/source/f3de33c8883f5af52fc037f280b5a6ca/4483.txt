TEXT:
1. Barry Clendenon who runs this at OMB, and was at our meeting
yesterday,  hadn't seen your $20-25 mill. figure cited in this a.m.
request, said he thought it would be much lower at $5-10, but wanted to
get FDA's scrubbed numbers.  He said he hadn't talked to Josh Gotbaum
about this.

2. Janice Oliver at FDA says they will send numbers over to OMB in an
hour, she expects the figure to be $28 mill.

3. I encouraged Barry to talk to Gotbaum (who I haven't heard back from)
and come up with a figure, even if it is a range, that can be floated.

4. FYI. USDA says that the groups will be very unhappy if this is just
supporting fruits and vegs and FDA. They plan to ask for $40 mill.
(testing, outreach, etc) according to Olsen and will send that figure over
to their OMB guy Wetherly.


A range seems preferable tb a figure given the speed of these
caluclations, but a substantial figure seems better than a minimal
commitment. Barry at one point said it was a $1-20 million range.    That
is obviously so small as to not imply not being a significant comitment.
It might be worth making a call to Josh G. and reminding him we need a
defensible number here.

Regards, Tom
