               Chris and I were hoping to get some feedback from you on the attached memo
               which proposes a format for the accomplishments chapter in the President's
               book on race. We hope that our next step will be to meet with Michael
               waldman and others to flesh out the themes.

                            THE PRESIDENT'S REPORT ON RACE
                      CHAPTER ON ADMINISTRATION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

Goals
1. Convey Administration's key principles (e.g. opportunity, responsibility, community, etc.)
   and describe successes, occasional missteps, and hard choices in carrying them out.
2. Use this chapter to tell a compelling story rather than provide a comprehensive list of every
   accomplishment. Resist making every Administration accomplishment a race
   accomplishment.
3. Act as a bridge between chapters on our past history and our future direction. Organizing
   themes need to be consistent with chapters which precede and follow.
4. Be honest rather than excessively celebratory.
5. Show the right level of detail without being boring.

Organization of Chapter
This chapter would be organized chronologically by looking at the key themes of the Clinton
Administration beginning with the campaign and following each year in office. For each year or
logical period oftime, we would describe the values that were at the core of the policy-making
decisions, such as opportunity, responsibility, and community. We would also examine the key
struggles and hard choices made, especially those which have an impact on race issues. Finally,
we will describe the outcomes of the policy decisions and how they affect race issues. Resource
documents will include State of the Union addresses and supporting documents, speeches,
DPCINEC accomplishments documents, and personal interviews with staff.

Personal Stories
In addition to the historical narrative, this chapter could contain some short anecdotes, set off in
separate boxes, of people or organizations whose lives were transformed by Clinton
Administration policies and initiatives. For example, one story might describe a revitalized
urban community which was turned around by a series of policies such as Empowerment Zones
and increased lending to minority businesses. Another story might describe a high school with a
large Latino popUlation which has benefited by increased Title I funding, bilingual education
programs, after school initiatives, and school to work programs. A third story might describe a
middle class family's search for housing and the increasing opportunities for home ownership
made available by Administration policies. A fourth story might describe a mother's chance to
get offwe1fare, obtain job training, and start a new job.

Content Issues
1. Bipartisanship. This should not be simply a self-congratulatory document. Rather it should
   include a discussion of difficult issues and of successes and failures. It is important to
   appeal to a bipartisan audience so all of America is interested in the issue or at least in the
   document. We might consider a report on the nation's accomplishments rather than solely


                                                  1
     ..

             the President's accomplishments.
          2. Role ofgovernment. The chapter should discuss the role of government in addressing races
             issues
          3. Macro policies. We will need to decide whether to include macro policies such as the
             impact of economic growth on race issues.
          4. Race-neutral policies. Should we include policies which are intended to be race neutral but
             which have a disproportionate impact on minorities, whether negative or positive, in areas
             where disparities exist? Policies of this type would include: the EITC, minimum wage
             increases, increased funding for Head Start.
          5. Race-targeted policies. It seems obvious that we would include policies that are
             specifically- designed to assist minority groups. This might include policies such as the
             Hispanic Education Initiative, loans to minority businesses, eliminating ethnic health
             disparities, etc.
