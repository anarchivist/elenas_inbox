 TEXT:
 Rich Tarplin is okay with Grassley. He would also like to add Sen. Reid
 and possibly Rep. Waxman, and definitely thinks Kohl should be invited.
 Are there other Floridians we should consider? This list may already be
 getting too large, though. We only have 10 minutes for the event.

 Subject: Nursing Homes

 In consultation with Sen. Graham and Rep. Jim Davis, I have come up with
 the following invitation list for the Nursing Homes Bill Signing:

 Sen. Graham-lead sponsor
 Sen. Grassley--very helpful on this bill, Graham wants him invited
 Sen. Roth-helpful, bill went through Finance


Sen. Moynihan--bill went through Finance

Rep.   Davis-lead sponsor
Rep.   Bilirakis--helpful, went through his subcommittee
Rep.   Sherrod Brown--helpful, went through his subcommittee
Rep.   Dingell--went through commerce--very helpful
Rep.   Bliley--went through commerce

I have a call into HHS to see if they have any further thoughts on this
list. Any problem with the above Members? Graham felt pretty strong about
inviting Grassley. He has apparently been very helpful on this
legislation. Let me know if you have a problem with this. Also, we will
probably add Sen. Kohl. Apparently, Sen. Mack has not done much to help
on this bill, both Davis and Graham did not think he needed to come.
