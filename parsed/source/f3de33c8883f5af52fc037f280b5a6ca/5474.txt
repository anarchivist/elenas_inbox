TEXT:
How should we handle getting back to Jack about what's missing or
inadequate from their straw-man memo on how to spend the $5 billion?

Child care and community prosecutors are obvious omissions; school reform
is confused and underfunded, civil rights is hard to tell.

Pell and Title I seem way overfunded. I don't know what to say about
McCaffrey. Welfare to work vouchers and anti-smoking did well.  Food
safety??
