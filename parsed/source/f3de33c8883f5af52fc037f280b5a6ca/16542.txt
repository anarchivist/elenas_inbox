TEXT:
Folks--I have received a request from NEA to meet with the folks
organizing the childcare conference.  Mary Elizabeth Teasley is interested
in exploring ideas for the conference; would you like me to arrange a
meeting? I know you have been taking the lead on bringing in people for
outreach--did you do educators? Should she be brought in as part of
another groups? Please advise; thanks.
