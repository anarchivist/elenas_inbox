TEXT:
Ugh- I didn't finish that last email before I sent it.   It must be
Friday. Sorry.

To continue ... Jose' and I generally thought we could live with the House
Republican proposal since it serves our main purposes, even though it
isn't perfect. There are two red flags: amnesty for all Nicaraguans
(including those who have never had a case in the pipeline) and
elimination of the unskilled workers category (10,000 visas).

Amnesty. This administration has never supported amnesty, and there
doesn't appear to be a strong substantive argument to give it to
Nicaraguans over any other Central American group. However, the main
person who would beat us up on this is Lamar Smith-- and he's supporting
the proposal. We can expect to hear members from the Hispanic Caucus and
CBC complain that amnesty for this group is inequitable.

Legal Immigration #s. The eliminat'ion of the unskilled workers category is
another issue we need to feel out.   Sen. Abraham is not too happy about
this part of the proposal, but he may not oppose the bill on these
grounds. This visa category doesn't tend to have strong support, but some
will probably oppose its elimination.

Another concern is that the House plan would subject the old standards for
suspension and the 4,000 cap retroactively to all non-Central
Americans/Nicaraguans who had cases in the pipeline (our bill would have
covered them). However, this group is only a fraction of the total and
the administrative remedy we were considering would not have covered them.

The Republicans are really going out on a limb for some fairly transparent
political reasons-- but as long as they are the ones making the case for
greater leniency, it makes things easier on us.  The general consensus
seems to be that we stay away from endorsing amnesty and the proposal for
now. We may end up signing it, but we should hold out to see if they will
make more improvements to their plan.
