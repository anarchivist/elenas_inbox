ATT SUBJECT: Veto Message on Product Liability Bill

ATT TO: Todd Stern                                 STERN T

TEXT:
I thought I would comment directly to you on the subject veto
message, which your office circulated earlier for comment.
In light of this bill's background and the Administration's
position on the bill, I have made no attempt to edit the message,
but would like to make the following points.
If you haven't already done so, I urge that the Justice Department
be given the opportunity to review the message before it is
released.  It would take someone knowledgeable from Justice to
determine the factual accuracy of many of the statements contained
in the message.
For a veto message, at least from my perspective, the tone is
too harsh for a formal governmental communication to the Congress
by the President. This communication will be part of the
President's official papers. This tone would be more appropriate
for a press release or other document related to the veto. This
message as written is not Presidential.  It reads like a lawyer's
brief that is trying to score points.
In the second paragraph on page 3, the references to private
groups (e.g., MADD and Handgun Control) are not appropriate for a
veto message.
The message is too long.
