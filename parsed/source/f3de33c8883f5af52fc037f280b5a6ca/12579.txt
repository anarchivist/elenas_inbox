                            Administration Progress on H-2A Reform
                                              May 12, 1999

     Farm workers are among the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. A verage annual
     earnings of farm worker families are only about $6,500 and farm workers are employed on
     average only about 26 weeks per year.

     The H-2A "guest worker" program admits temporary nonimmigrant agricultural workers to
     provide farmers with an adequate supply of laborers during the peak periods in the growing
     season. There is no cap on the number ofH-2A visas granted annually. Currently, there are l.6
     million hand-harvest farm workers in the U.S. of which it is estimated that approximately
     600,000 are undocumented, 1 million are legal (citizens or authorized resident labor), and 35,000
     are in the H-2A program.

     Emplover Obligations

     Under the current program, in order to hire H-2A workers, an employer must demonstrate
     to the Department of Labor (DOL) that:

            (a) there are not sufficient U.S. workers able, willing, qualified and available to
            perform the services; and,

            (b) there will be no adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of
            similarly-employed U.S. workers.

     To meet these criteria, employers are required to:

            ../     pay workers the higher of the minimum wage, locally prevailing wage, or an
                    "adverse effect wage rate" (AEWR), determined by the average wage paid to
                    non-managerial agricultural workers in the state;
            ../     provide free housing to workers coming from outside the commuting area;
            ../     reimburse workers' inbound transportation if they complete half the
                    contract, outbound also if they complete the contract; and,
            ../     guarantee 3/4 of the hours of the contract the grower offers; and,
            ../     hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies during the first half of the work
                    contract.

     Administration Principles on Reform

     The H-2A program has been heavily criticized by the GAO, DOL's IG, and the Hill primarily
     due to the administrative burdens placed on growers and its failure to adequately protect workers.
      As a result, Congress has proposed many different bills to restructure the H-2A program.

     The Administration has acknowledged problems with the program and is working
     administratively (through administrative actions and the regulatory process) to reengineer and
     streamline the H-2A program to ease adjudication burdens while maintaining strong worker
     protections. The Administration does not believe that legislation is necessary or appropriate at
     this time.
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

The Administration's guiding principles in reforming the H-2A program' are designed to create a
system:

       ./     with procedures that are simple and the least burdensome for growers;
       ./     which assures an adequate labor supply for growers in a predictable and timely manner;
       ./     that provides a clear and meaningful first preference for U.S. farm workers and that
              diminishes the reliance on foreign workers;
       ./     which avoids the transfer of costs and risks from businesses to low wage workers;
       ./     that encourages longer periods of employment for legal U.S. workers; and,
       ./     which assures decent wages and working conditions for domestic and foreign farm
              workers, and that normal market forces work to improve wages, benefits, and working
              conditions.

The Administration is committed to improving the H-2A program to assure growers of an adequate,
predictable labor supply while protecting U.S. farm workers who are among the poorest and most
vulnerable in our society.

FY 2000 Budget Initiative

       The President's pending Budget requests $10 million to fund America's Agricultural Labor
       Network ("AgNet") that would benefit growers and workers by having an efficient alternative
       mechanism to match workers with employment opportunities. AgNet would serve as an
       information broker through an electronic system that allows both growers to find workers and
       workers to find employment opportunities that meet their needs (e.g., location, duration, type of
       crop, etc.).

H-2A Regulatory Reform

       DOL will soon publish a final regulation that will complete an earlier proposal to:

       -reduce the length of time that employers must file an H-2A application from 60 to 45 days
       before the date when employees are needed;

       -reduce the deadline for when employer-provided housing must be available for inspection
       before the date of need; and,

       -modify the requirement that certified H-2A employers provide notice of the exact date on
       which"H-2A employees have departed for the place of employment.

       INS will soon issue a final regulation that will complete an earlier proposal to delegate H-2A
       petitioning authority to DOL. This proposed change would significantly reduce the burden to
       growers when filing for H-2A workers by removing an entire step from the current process.

       DOL has also made additional administrative changes to the H-2A program such as
       modifications to the positive recruitment requirement. DOL intends to consistently meet the
       existing 20 day deadline to issue approved certifications for growers.
