TEXT:
We should think about doing a food safety radio address over the next
month saying:


1. Food Safety Budget. Congress is marking up the budget this month
(subcomms this week, full committees likely the week after, full bill on
the floor after that) and rumors are the subcommittees are going to fund
us at less than the $101 million Administration proposal, some rumors are
at half the request. We need the whole amount -- in particular it funds
our imported food safety policy.

2.  Summer is the most dangerous time for food safety, (there was a recent
salmonella outbreak in children's cereal), Congress should act now.

3. Also, we could consider pushing for our bill to give more teeth to
USDA so it can order the recall of tainted foods and fine companies that
don't comply with food safety regs.   The bill is languishing. Congress
should act now, before another t.ragedy.
