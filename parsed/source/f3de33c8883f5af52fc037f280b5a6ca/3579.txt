TEXT:
We have been asked for our position on a bill that would raise postage to
33 cents and dedicate the additional money to breast cancer research.
Josh Gotbaum, Chris and I tend to think we should remain silent, since we
generally oppose adding postage for particular causes but don't like to
oppose anything related to breast cancer.  The other option is to oppose
it but only on the grounds that we generally oppose this type of thing.
Any thoughts?
