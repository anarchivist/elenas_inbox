TEXT:
James Lacy, the president of Rotary International requested a meeting with
the President which the scheduling office could not grant, but he is
coming in for a photo-op with the President and the scheduling office has
asked DPC and Public Liaison to meet with him.  He is currently scheduled
to come in for Friday at 11:15 to meet with Bruce, Elena, Chris, Ben
Johnson (OPL) , and Victoria Lynch (OPL). He wants the President to
promise to discuss polio eradication in Africa and the rest of the world
in this year's State of the Union. James Lacy is supposed to have his
photo-op at noon so we have tentatively agreed to discuss polio
eradication with him before hand. please let me know if you think that
this meeting is a bad idea or if I can continue to work with OPL to set
this meeting up.   Thanks.
