               CLINTON ADMINISTRATION FISCAL 1999 BUDGET
                           DRAFT January 19, 1998

Summary
          The Clinton Administration's Fiscal Year 1999 budget contains $602 million for civil
rights enforcement agencies, $86 million or 14 percent more than was enacted in last year's
budget.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
        The Administration's 1999 budget contains $279 million for the EEOC, or 15 percent
more than the enacted ·1998 budget. Funds go to reduce the average time it takes to resolve
private sector complaints from over 9.4 months to 6 months by the year 2001 through a
combination of investments in information technology, increased use of mediation, and increased
staffing. The proposal dramatically expands Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) programs,
doubling the number of complaints eligible for ADR in 1999 to 16,000 cases, or 20 percent of
incoming cases. The Administration seeks $40 million over 3 years for ADR expansion, with
$13 million requested in 1999. The budget also allocates $10 million for new information
technology.

  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
          The Administration's budget proposes $52 million, or an over 70 percent increase from
  last year for HUD's efforts to reduce housing discrimination. The budget requests $29 million,
  or a more than 50 percent increase, for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP), which
  provides funding to private fair housing groups to assist in enforcement ofthe Fair Housing Act.
  The HUD budget proposal allocates $10 million of FHIP funding for a targeted, audit-baseci
  enforcement initiative in 20 areas nationwide that will use paired testing, in which otherwise
  identical applicants of different races approach realtors or landlords, in order to detect and
  eliminate housing discrimination. The Administration proposal also seeks $23 million, or an $8
. million increase, for the Fair Housing Assistance Program, to support the creation of additional
  State and local housing organizations to meet the needs of currently under served populations
  and to aid joint investigations and enforcement activities.

 Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division
          The President's 1999 budget provides $71.6 million, more than a 10 percent increase over
 the 1998 level of $64.7 million. One component of the Department of Justice initiative is a $1
 million fund to enhance coordination of Federal civil rights enforcement among all the Federal
 civil rights agencies. This coordination will lead to more consistent enforcement of civil rights
 laws, and allow agencies to compare and improve program effectiveness in areas such as
 technical assistance. New funding will also permit the Department of Justice to significantly
 expand investigation and prosecutions of police misconduct as well as violations of the
 Americans with Disabilities Act.




                                                                            u .... ~"ement System

                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
        The Administration's request of$68 million for OFCCP includes funds to expand the
Fair Enforcement Initiative. OFCCP programs will increase by 10 percent in 1999 the number
of compliance reviews conducted. OFCCP will also modernize its computer systems in order to
permit the agency to accept electronically submitted reports from contractors.

Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights
        The President's budget proposal of $68 million provides an increase of $6.5 million over
the 1998 enacted budget to fund technology improvements to increase productivity and customer
service. These additional funds will also enable the Department of Education to continue to
invest sufficient resources in higher education desegregation reviews and to focus on building
partnerships with States to address statewide compliance with civil rights laws.

Department of Uealth and Uuman Services (UUS), Office of Civil Rights
        The Administration is requesting $21 million for HHS' s Office of Civil Rights to
continue its focus on preventative activities such as compliance reviews and technical assistance
to ensure that persons do not encounter discrimination in HHS programs, including in the areas
of managed care, inter-ethnic adoption, limited English proficient services, and welfare reform.

U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
       The President's budget proposal increases funding for USDA's civil rights programs from
$15 million to $19 million to increase human resources management, outreach to
under-represented customers, involvement of small and disadvantaged businesses in USDA
programs, conflict resolution activities, and processing complaints brought by employees and
customers.

The Department of Labor, Office of Civil Rights
        The President's budget maintains the current $5 million offunding for the Department of
Labor's Office of Civil Rights to enforce the Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit
discrimination in all Labor Department financial assistance programs. With this funding, the
office will promote voluntary compliance with existing non-discrimination laws through
education and technical assistance. The office will also use the resources to encourage States to
promote the use of alternate dispute resolution.

Department of Transportation, Office of Civil Rights
        The Administration budget contains $7 million for the Transportation Office of Civil
Rights to improve its investigation and processing of EEO complaints. A $1 million increase
will fund additional activities directed to reduce case back-logs and address new complaints.

  U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
       The President's budget includes $11 million for the Commission in order to carry out its
mission in conducting investigations, educating the public on civil rights matters, and operating
programs that address both local and national civil rights interests and concerns.

                                   January 19, 1998


Q:   What did the Clinton Administration announce with regard to civil rights enforcement?

A:   The Clinton Administration announced its Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposal of $602
     million for civil rights enforcement agencies -- this is $86 million or 14 percent greater
     than the FY 1998 budget. The President's proposal places new emphasis on preventative
     measures and non-litigation strategies while also strengthening the ability of federal
     agencies to enforce existing civil rights laws. The Administration's budget provides for
     increased use of voluntary alternate dispute resolution (ADR) so parties can have their
     cases heard more easily, cheaply and promptly. The highlight of the President's proposal
     is a 15 percent increase in funding for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
     With this infusion of funds, the EEOC will be able to reduce the average time it takes to
     resolve a complaint from over 9 months to 6 months by the year 2000.

Q:   Why is the President proposing these actions?

A:   This budget keeps the President's commitment to ensure equal opportunity for all
     Americans: that no one should be denied such essentials as ajob, a home or a chance at
     an education because of the color of their skin, a disability, their gender or their religion.
      One of the key observations John Hope Franklin of the President's Initiative on Race
     made in his November 30, 1997 letter to the President was that the budgets of civil rights
     agencies have not kept pace with their increased responsibilities. This budget seeks to
     provide sufficient resources and promote management reforms to allow civil rights
     agencies to do their jobs.

Q.   How does this budget relate to the President's Initiative on Race?

A.   The plan was influenced both by the topics raised during the year-long dialogue, such as
     housing discrimination, and by specific advice such as comments by John Hope
     Fr~nklin's in his November 30, 1997 letter encouraging increased resources for civil
     rights agencies.

Q.   What other agencies are part of the Civil Rights Enforcement Initiative?

A.   The President's budget encourages the use of ADR, education and improved enforcement
     across the major civil rights agencies and offi~es. It includes funding for the following
     agencies involved in civil rights enforcement:

                           Civil Rights Enforcement Funding

Q:     What does the President's budget propose with respect to the Civil Rights Division
       at the Department of Justice?

A:     The Administration's 1999 budget proposes a 10 percent increase for the Department of
       Justice for a total of $71.6 million. This funding will permit the Department to continue
       its efforts in enforcing the laws that provide civil and criminal protections from
       discrimination, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and the
       Americans with Disabilities Act. The budget also includes funds specifically to enhance
       the Civil Rights Division's role in coordinating federal civil rights enforcement across
       agencies, through technical and enforcement assistance.

Q:     What actions is the President taking with respect to appointing a new Chairman of
       the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission?




                                                 2
     reappointed Paul M. Igasaki to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and
     named him Acting Chairman. Currently, three of the five positions on the Commission
     are filled, which is enough for a quorum. The fourth member to be appointed is for a
     Republican slot, and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) has already indicated
     his choice for the position. The President is working as expeditiously as possible to
     nominate a fifth member of the Commission.

Q:   What does the President's plan do to improve performance at the EEOC?

A:   This plan creates specific goals and invests in new technology and procedures that will
     significantly improve EEOC performance. The initiative's reforms will reduce the
     average time it takes to process a complaint from over 9 months to 6 months by the end
     of Fiscal Year 2000. This reduction will be achieved in part through a $10 million
     infusion of technology improvements, and an investment in alternate dispute resolution--
      more than doubling the number of cases utilizing the more efficient and prompt alternate
     dispute resolution (ADR).

Q:   Is the President's budget simply a way to increase funding for affirmative action
     programs?

A:     No. The President's budget is aimed at preventing and eliminating discrimination through
     . emphasizing compliance with and enforcement of the various existing civil rights laws,
       such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, and the Americans with
       Disabilities Act. Affirmative action programs are only one tool (and not the most widely
       used tool) of civil rights enforcement.

                  NEW CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES
                             DRAFT, January 19, 1998

        The Vice President today announced a package of civil rights enforcement initiatives that
places new emphasis on prevention and non-litigation remedies for discrimination while
simultaneously strengthening civil rights agencies' ability to enforce anti-discrimination law. The
plan promotes prevention by providing increased resources for compliance reviews and technical
assistance, and offers an alternative to expensive litigation by funding a dramatic expansion of
alternate dispute resolution (A DR) mechanisms. The plan also sets specific performance goals
for the EEOC to speed processing of complaints and reduce case backlog, and provides for
greater coordination across federal agencies and offices. The Clinton Administration's Fiscal
Year 1999 Budget contains $602 million for civil rights enforcement agencies, $86 million or 14
percent more than was enacted in last year's budget.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
        The centerpiece of the EEOC budget proposal is an expansion of the ADR program that
will double the number of complaints eligible for ADR in 1999 to 16,000 cases, or 20 percent of
incoming cases. The Administration plan seeks to expand ADR over the next three years with the
goal of providing a voluntary option for ADR in all eligible cases for employers and employees
who choose it. The Administration's 1999 Budget also sets specific performance goals for the
EEOC to reduce its backlog. Through a combination of improved information technology,
increased use of mediation, and more investigators, the EEOC will reduce the average time it
takes to resolve private sector complaints from over 9.4 months to 6 months by the year 2000.
The budget also sets aside new funds for information technology to enhance inter-office
communication, eliminate redundant data entry procedures, and provide for greater operational
efficiency through the sharing of information.
         Overall the budget requests $279 million for the EEOC, or 15 percent more than the
enacted 1998 budget. The budget includes $13 million for expanded ADR and $10 million for
improved technology.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
        The Administration's budget proposes an increased emphasis on reducing
discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity in housing. The highlight of the HUD budget
proposal is a targeted, audit-based enforcement initiative in 20 areas nationwide that would use
paired testing, in which otherwise identical applicants of different races approach realtors or
landlords, in order to detect and eliminate housing discrimination. The Administration proposal
also seeks $23 million, or an $8 million increase, for the Fair Housing Assistance Program, to
support the creation of additional State and local housing organizations to meet the needs of
currently under served populations and to aid joint investigations and enforcement activities.
        The Administration's budget proposes $52 million, or an over 70 percent increase from
last year, to enable HUD to meet its goals of ensuring equal opportunity in housing. The budget
contains $29 million, or a more than 50 percent increase, for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program


                                                 I
Housing Act. The paired testing program has been allocated $10 million.

Key Aspects of the Budget:

* Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
        The plan increases the use of ADR in the federal government as a voluntary option
available to parties that seek a non-litigation solution to their case. Mediation programs are
expanded in almost every agency, most notably in the EEOC where the number of mediations are
expected to double to 16,000 in the upcoming year.

* Expanded Outreach and Compliance Programs
        Technical assistance and outreach is improved and compliance programs are made more
thorough. For example, the Department of Labor, Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs (OFCCP) will modernize its computer systems in order to permit the agency to accept
reports submitted electronically from contractors. The Administration's budget will enable
OFCCP to increase by 10 percent the number of compliance reviews it conducts.

* Strong Enforcement
        The President's budget increases resources for civil rights agencies budgets by 14%
overall, and expands the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division specifically by more than
10% from $64.7 million enacted in 1998 to $71.6 in FY 1999. Programs to help guarantee equal
access to housing increase at HUD increase by 70%.

 * Improved Coordination:
       The budget recognizes the need for improved coordination of Federal civil rights
enforcement policy among agencies and provides funds for this purpose to the DOJ Civil Rights
Division under the direction of Bill Lann Lee.
