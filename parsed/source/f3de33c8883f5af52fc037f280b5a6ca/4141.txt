As you know, in the wake of the Hudson hamburger outbreak, USDA is seeking
to have the White House send legislation to the Hill on Friday that would
provide additional enforcement authorities to USDA (e.g., recall, civil
money).  I know Secretary Glickman is hot to move on this, but I do not
believe this is the right response to the Hudson outbreak. First, any
legislation should not single out USDA, but should apply to CDC and FDA as
well. As we have seen repeatedly during our work on the President's Food
Safety Initiative one of the biggest food safety problems we have is the
poor coordination between USDA, FDA, and CDC. Some public health experts
have begun criticizing the poor coordination among our science and
regulatory agencies on Hudson, and Hudson may prove to be a better example
of poor coordination than of an effective response. Sending up USDA-only
legislation reinforces that point.   Second, recall authority and money
penalties may not be as important as record inspection authority. We
should take the time to get the right answer. When you have a minute, I
would like to discuss this with you, but in the mean time I would urge you
to support telling USDA to hold off.

FYI .. CBS Evening News will run a piece tonight about an E. coli 0157:H7
outbreak in alfalfa sprouts in Michigan and Virginia that occurred over
the same time period as Hudson, presented a greater public health threat,
and received no public attention.    It may imply that USDA overreacted and
FDA underreacted
