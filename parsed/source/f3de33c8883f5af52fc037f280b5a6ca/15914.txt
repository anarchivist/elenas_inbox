TEXT:
I've set up a DPC-hosted briefing for MADD's Board of Directors, per Tom
Howarth's request and your note, for Friday, June 20, 10-11:30 am, Indian
Treaty Room. Two of the three speakers are confirmed -- NHTSA
Administrator Rick Martinez (.08 BAC) and Eileen Adams from DoJ (victims'
rights). They've asked for McCaffrey for third speaker, but he's unlikely
since he's going to their reception the night before and has other
commitments.  I'll know later today.  Elena/Jose -- would either of you be
able to speak to the group in the third half hour (11- 11:30?). Topics of
interest not addressed by other two speakers are alcohol link to drug
strategy and alcohol advertising restrictions.
