TEXT:
The welfare law prevents legal immigrants who arrive after 8/96 from
getting something called means tested benefits. After a very long,
tortured process, HHS is about to release its definition of this term
(although it has already given Lamar Smith and others on the Hill an
advance peek).  It will place only a few programs off-limits to these new
entrants -- mostly programs that are already off-limits because of other
explicit provisions in the law (Medicaid, TANF, SSI, food stamps). Now,
however, it is dawning on all of us that we have this new child health
program.  I have heard that HHS's definition would probably make this
program inaccessible to new entrants. We and OMB are asking HHS to take a
few days to examine this question before releasing its definition. HHS is
more inclined not to wait.

Let me know if you want to be involved in this issue as we figure it out.
