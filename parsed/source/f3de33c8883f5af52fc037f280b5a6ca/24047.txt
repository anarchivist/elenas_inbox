Dear [Brady Bill Supporter]:

       Next week, you will have the opportunity to vote on one of the most important pieces of
gun legislation since you supported the Brady bill in 1993. And I urge you, in the strongest
terms possible, to support the common sense gun measures included in Senate's juvenile crime
bill.

         I especially ask you to support closing the gun show loophole and to reject the false
arguments and phony reforms that will be put forward by opponents of this meaningful gun
legislation. As a Brady bill supporter, you have heard these arguments before:

       Criminals don't buy guns from gun dealers or at gun shows; they buy them on the street
       or steal them. New gun laws only serve to inconvenience law-abiding citizens.

       Gun laws only stop people who need a gun for self protection from getting a gun when
       they need it most.

       Every new gun law is just another step towards federal gun registration or confiscation.

        Of course, all Americans now know the truth: since the Brady Law's enactment, well
over a quarter of a million illegal handgun sales have been blocked -- and no law-abiding citizen
has been stopped from buying a gun for sport or self-protection. In fact, the Brady Law has
proven to be one of the most effective law enforcement tools ever. However, none ofthis has
stopped the gun lobby from recycling the same empty arguments in an effort to kill or weaken the
gun show legislation passed by the Senate. And unfortunately, the NRA's siren song has
swayed at least some in the House leadership, who have proposed gun show legislation that is
riddled with new and dangerous loopholes similar to those that were defeated in the Senate.

        Make no mistake: your vote on these important details can make the difference in
whether or not we close the gun show loophole once and for all. For instance, if the House
leadership's proposal to put a 72-hour time limit on background checks at gun shows applied to
our National Instant Check System (NICS), the Justice Department estimates that 22 percent of
the fugitives and felons that have been denied guns -- or more than 9,300 since the start of this
year -- would have them today. But that is not all. The House leadership's bill would also
allow hundreds of guns to be sold at flea markets without any background check, and it would
prevent law enforcement from tracing many of guns that are sold at gun shows and later used in
crimes. I hope you will agree with me that these provisions are simply unacceptable.

       As a supporter of the Brady bill, you have a record of putting the interests of the
American people over the clout of the gun lobby. In the that same spirit, I ask you again to vote
your convictions -- and to vote to strengthen our guns as much as possible.
