TEXT:
Having talked to Rawls from USDA subsequent to the meeting, I think there
was a little muddle on the farmers piece.  He favors the idea of a grower
meeting to show the Administration has not forgotten them (avoiding future
Senator Ford rants/opposition) and keep them on board. However, the idea
of a meeting to try and forge a consensus on what to do on farmers doesn't
make sense. This piece doesn't need/can't be put in place prematurely--
just the groups need to be kept at a minimum anxiety so they let the
process move forward.
