TEXT:
to begin the process of developing their own budget.   They spent the first
meeting discussing CPI and Medicare.   The expectation is that the group
will include the Feinstein-Chafee legal immigrant proposal, which
grandfathers those who were receiving benefits on August 22, 1996 (not all
immigrants in the U.S. at that time).   Most staff are currently lukewarm
to our $3 billion welfare to work proposal and the restoration of food
stamp cuts seems off the radar screen.
