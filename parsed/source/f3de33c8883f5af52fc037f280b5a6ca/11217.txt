TEXT:
I spoke with Karen Tramontano and Chuck Marr in NEC about whether they had
developed Q&A on Davis-Bacon and on the UAW tax proposal. When I spoke to
Karen very briefly a few minutes ago she said she had everything she
needed on these issues and that she didn't need anything else.  She had to
get off of the phone before the conversation went further.

Chuck sent me the attached Davis Bacon Q&A that was apparently approved
for other purposes last month, and said that nothing should have changed
since then -- and that Karen had it. He also said that Karen knew the UAW
issues as well as anyone, and that she would have whatever Podesta
needed.  Karen and Podesta have both met with the UAW on this issue in the
past.

                             Davis-Bacon and School Construction
                                      January 20, 1999


Q:     Would Davis-Bacon apply to the Administration's new school construction proposal?

A:     First of all, I want to reiterate the Administration is a strong supporter of the application
       of Davis-Bacon when Federal Government outlays are involved.

·      Whether Davis-Bacon should apply to this tax cut proposal is an issue that has come up in
       the past and we have been asked to take another look at it and we are doing that.


Background:
The Administration position has been Davis-Bacon would not apply to our school construction
proposal because it is on the tax side of the budget (where Davis-Bacon historically has not been
applied) and not on the spending side (where Davis-Bacon does apply). Other similar tax
subsidies, such as tax exempt bonds and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, have not
historically been subject to Davis-Bacon

The AFL, especially the Building Trades, have been aggressively advocating adding
Davis-Bacon to our proposal. The President has told them that we will take another look and an
inter-agency group is doing that. We are also consulting with our allies on the Hill as well. A
Davis-Bacon provision was not included in the Daschle or Lautenberg bills which were
introduced on SOTU day.
