TEXT:
We learned today that SAMHSA plans to have the grant application notice
for the FY 99 targeted capacity treatment grants ready in mid-January.
It's not big bucks, but if we end up with increased funding in the 2000
budget for these grants, this might make a nice preview or rollout package
-- we could highlight some of the current grantees, release the 99 grant
notice, and announce that we are proposing to increase funding for this
important effort in the next budget,  SAMHSA expects to fund about $30 M
in FY 99 grants, of which $20 M will provide 2nd year funding for the
treatment projects started in FY 98 and $10 M will fund new projects.
One possible venue might be USCM meeting (Jan 29th?) -- they are big
supporters of these grants and SAMHSA is working hard to ensure that
locals apply for and receive a significant share of the funds.
