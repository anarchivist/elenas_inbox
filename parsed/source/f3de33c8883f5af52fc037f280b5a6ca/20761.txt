S. 2307-- DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
           AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors:   Stevens (R), Alaska; Shelby (R), Alabama)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2307, the Department of Transportation and
Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the Senate
Appropriations Committee. Your consideration of the AdministrationD,s
views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s effort to include
in its bill many of the priorities recently agreed to by the President and
Congress in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-2l).
However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result, a variety of
critical programs are under-funded. The only way to achieve the
appropriate investment level is to offset discretionary spending by using
savings in other areas.  The PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget proposes levels
of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan
Budget Agreement by making savings in mandatory and other programs
available to help finance this spending.  In the Transportation Equity
Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis -- took similar action in
approving funding for surface transportation programs together with
mandatory offsets. The Administration urges the Congress to consider such
mandatory proposals for other priority discretionary programs.

        The Administration is concerned that the Committee bill could
seriously disrupt air transportation safety and vital Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) and Coast Guard modernization programs, and delay
AmtrakD,s progress towards operating self-sufficiency. The Senate could
partially accommodate the funding increases recommended below by adhering
more closely to the PresidentD,s request for the Airport Grants program,
High Speed Rail, Coast Guard Alteration of Bridges, and other programs.

        The bill also includes a number of objectionable language
provisions. In particular, the Secretary of Transportation has indicated
that he would recommend that the President veto the bill if it includes
section 322, which could severely limit the use of project labor
agreements. The AdministrationD,s concerns with the Committee bill are
discussed below.

Air Transportation and Highway Safety

        The Administration strongly urges the Senate to restore the $50
million reduction to FAA Operations and eliminate the earmarks for
low-priority programs, such as subsidies for non-cost beneficial contract
towers.  These funds are necessary to ensure that the FAA can hire the
security personnel and safety inspectors needed to meet the demands from


increased air travel.  To protect the safety of automobile travelers
adequately, we ask that the Senate provide an additional $12 million for
high priority National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
programs.  In addition, the Administration urges the Senate to provide
funding requested by the President to add a second civil signal to the
Global Positioning System.

FAA and Coast Guard Modernization

        The Administration is concerned about language that is intended to
constrain outlays for FAA Facilities and Equipment in FY 1999. We
question whether this provision can be implemented and, if so, whether it
would lead to unintended and unfavorable programmatic effects. We look
forward to working with the Senate to address our concerns.  In addition,
we urge the Senate to fund fully the PresidentD,s request for the
Facilities and Equipment account.   Funding at any lower level could delay
National Airspace System modernization.

         The Administration objects to the virtual elimination of funding
for the Flight 2000 program. This program is a key element of the FAAD,s
plans to make a transition to a more efficient, user involved,
satellite-based air traffic control system to meet the air traffic needs
of the next century. The Senate is requested to provide the $100 million
in the FAA Facilities and Equipment account to deploy explosive detection
systems. The CommitteeD,s decision to provide up to $100 million for this
purpose in the Airport Grants account would preclude the FAA from
deploying these systems based on security requirements and may result in
fewer systems being deployed.

        The Administration opposes the CommitteeD,s reduction of $57
million to the PresidentD,s request of $443 million for Coast Guard
capital investments. These capital projects provide long-term operating
savings and are necessary to ensure that the Coast Guard has the necessary
infrastructure to fulfill its maritime safety, drug interdiction,
environmental protection, and national security goals.  In.addition, the
Administration urges the Senate to fund fully the PresidentD,s request for
$8.5 million for the Nationwide Differential Global Positioning System.

Amtrak

        As this bill moves forward, we urge Congress to fund fully the
PresidentD,s request for Amtrak so that it can carry through on the
bipartisan, five-year reform plan envisioned by the Amtrak Reform and
Accountability Act of 1997. Amtrak is an essential component of the
nationD;s inter-city transportation system.

Access-to-Jobs

        The Administration requests that the Senate provide an additional
$50 million to fully fund the PresidentD,s request of $100 million for the
Access-to-Jobs program. This program is a critical component of the
AdministrationD,s welfare reform effort. The additional resources are
essential to helping more individuals in communities around the country
make a successful transition from welfare to work.

Civil Rights and Office of the Secretary

        The Administration strongly urges the Senate to restore the
20-percent reduction made by the Committee to the funding request for the
Office of Civil Rights.  This reduction would significantly hamper the


DepartmentO,s ability to enforce laws that prohibit discrimination in
Federally operated or assisted transportation programs. We also urge the
Senate to provide the PresidentO.s requested $62 million for the Office of
the Secretary and to delete the CommitteeO,s recommended new account
structure and limitation on political appointees. These changes are
necessary to avoid a reduction-in-force and to allow the Secretary to
manage the department effectively.

Earmarks

        The Committee has earmarked almost 400 transit projects, as well
as many airport, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and rail, and
infrastructure credit projects. Consistent with our objections to TEA-21,
the Administration believes that projects should be funded based upon
their merit and that funds should not be directed to low-priority projects
that cannot meet established selection criteria.

Language Provisions

        Section 322 would preclude the Department of Transportation from
using project labor agreements (PLAs), which are a contract mechanism to
achieve efficiencies in construction projects. Furthermore, the provision
is ambiguous, making its full impact difficult to assess and raising
questions as to its applicability to a host of laws and regulations
affecting workers. As noted above, the Secretary of Transportation would
recommend that the President veto this bill if it includes section 322.

         The Administration strongly opposes section 342 of the bill, which
would allow helicopters to operate and land on Federally-owned lands in
Alaska, including wilderness areas. This would be harmful to species and
habitat and disrupt Congress' carefully crafted balance on thi~ issue in
the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act (ANILCA).   Under
ANILCA. helicopter landings are permitted for emergency reasons and, on a
case-by-case basis, for non-emergency use in non-wilderness areas. The
Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture have previously recommended
that bills containing similar provisions be vetoed.

        The Administration requests that the Senate delete the provisions
in both the Coast Guard and FAA operating expenses appropriations language
that would prohibit the Coast Guard and the FAA from evaluating options
for collecting fees for their services. User fees may be a critical means
in the future for ensuring that the Coast Guard and the FAA have adequate
resources to meet their operating and capital needs without significantly
reducing other vital transportation programs.

        The Administration requests that the Senate delete the provision
allowing states to establish separate standards for licensing drivers on
commercial vehicles that do not cross state boundaries. This would
seriously undermine the single-license concept of the national commercial
driverO,s license which prevents drivers from spreading violations across
mUltiple licenses held in several States.
