TEXT:
Elena, I need to speak to you about this.  I had thought HHS had gone back
to the drawing board on this issue, but now I hear Kevin may call Bruce to
request a meeting on it.   (We may need a meeting, although not
necessarily with Bruce.)

(This is the welfare reform law's requirement that illegal (non-qualified)
aliens not get federal public benefits, and HHS is trying to determine
where programs like community health centers fit in.)
