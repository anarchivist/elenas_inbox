Elena:
not sure what POTUS wants to do with this, but here are two items for your
information:
1. NPR held up the letter from the cabinet agencies to state's regarding
our new rules until we could gain agreement that state's submitting
unified plans would not have to send one to every agency they wanted money
from. OMB and NPR convinced DoL that they should take lead in becoming
single point of contact for responses. Apparently there was lots of turf
issues between them and DoEd. on how to do this. We are working to present
a seamless interface, but be careful of what he says about it.
2.  Inter-Governmental Affairs and NPR met with the National Governor's
Association on a series of federal/state partnership issues and WIA was of
great interest to NGA. We offered to work with them in finding 6-10 states
who would be targeted for submitting truly unified state plans NEXT APRIL.
This will require a taskforce between NPR and NGA to work with agencies
involved to get focus on helping people improve their incomes vs. deciding
which program is meant for what problem.

If you need more, call or write.
