PLEASE PROVIDE ANY FINAL COMMENTS BY 2:00 P.M. TODAY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 5,
1998.

STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

        Today, I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 1385, the Workforce
Investment Act of 1998. This legislation represents the culmination of
bipartisan efforts of the Congress and the Administration to reform our
workforce development system so that it empowers America's workers and
responds to the economy of the twenty-first century.   I particularly want
to recognize the tireless efforts of Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Kennedy,
and Wellstone, and Representatives Goodling, McKeon, Clay, and Kildee in
guiding this legislation through the Congress.
                More than three years ago, I proposed a G.I. Bill for
America's Workers to inject choice, competition, and individual
responsibility into national workforce policy. Since then I have pursued
these goals to the fullest extent possible under current law.   I am now
pleased that this legislation, with overwhelming bipartisan support, takes
the necessary next steps to incorporate key principles of my proposal.
These principles -- including individual opportunity, leaner government,
State and local flexibility, accountability, and partnership with the
private sector -- will permit individuals and States to craft a lifelong
learning system that respects individual priorities, reflects local
conditions, and delivers results.
        The new workforce development system embodied in this legislation
will consolidate numerous Federal programs and create "individual
training accounts" -- or skill grants -- providing valuable resources
directly to American workers who need to enhance their skills.   Instead of
the decades old system of dispensing services through top-down, inflexible
bureaucracies, this new system would let the workers of America choose the
training they need, at any eligible institution they choose. H.R. 1385
will provide workers and job seekers
high-quality information on jobs, career options, and report cards of
training institutions, so that they can make informed choices. And it
will offer all Americans easy access to this information and to employment
and training services through one-stop career centers.


        I am pleased that the Workforce Investment Act supports my efforts
to expand lifelong learning by streamlining and improving the quality of
adult education programs.  The bill also reauthorizes and includes
important reforms to the Rehabilitation Act, including simplifying program


requirements, improving accountability, and enhancing consumer choice.   In
addition, it takes serious new steps to ensure that all information
technology procured by the Federal Government is accessible to individuals
with disabilities.
        Finally, I am especially gratified that this legislation
includes my Youth Opportunity proposal.  This program will help give hope
to tens of thousands of youth living in Empowerment Zones, Enterprise
Communities, and other high-poverty areas by helping them secure good jobs
and a brighter future.  I urge the Congress to ensure that the funds
appropriated in advance last year for this initiative are made available
now that the program is authorized, and to appropriate the full amount of
my fiscal year 1998 request for all activities authorized in this
legislation.
        The Workforce Investment Act will expand opportunities for working
men and women in today's vibrant, global economy.   It will help reduce the
number of people in our Nation who lack the skills to compete in todayD,s
economy. And it will help business benefit from a more skilled, highly
productive workforce.  For these reasons, I am delighted to sign the
Workforce Investment Act of 1998.
