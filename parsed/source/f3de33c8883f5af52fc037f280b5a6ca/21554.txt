TEXT:
Bruce and Elena:

Health Care -- Status of FDA Commissioner Confirmation: If all goes
according to plan, Jane Henney should be confirmed as the first woman and
the first oncologist FDA Commissioner.  Senator Nickles has indicated that
he will do everything possible to clear any remaining hurdles prior to
Congressional adjournment.  I thought you may want to advise Senior staff
tomorrow and consider whether you may want to release a POTUS & VPOTUS
statement tomorrow afternoon.

Health Care -- Home Health Care Update: The Republicans agreed to drop the
Roth IRA financing provision and instead fund the roughly $1.7 billion,
five year home health fix through savings equally divided from Medicare,
primarily from a home health care payment reimbursement reduction, and thro
ugh the gambling tax provision we discussed earlier.  Although the
industry and the Democrats are not completely thrilled with the home
health care policy, they believe that we did everything we could to
improve it and seemed to be placing most of the blame for the shortcomings
of the provisions squarely at the feet of the Republicans.  And certainly
between doing nothing and this, our Democrats and the home health care
industry opted for the compromise.
