 TEXT:
 Clinton says high welfare standards must remain

     WASHINGTON (AP)   States wanted the power to run their own
 welfare systems and should be responsible for meeting work targets
 in the law that granted that wish, President Clinton said Monday.
     But, he quickly added, he's unsure whether the federal
 government should punish the many states that expect to miss
 Wednesday's deadline for moving 75 percent of two-parent welfare
 families into work.
     A 50-state Associated Press survey found fewer than half the
 states are confident they will meet that deadline, the first of
 many in the welfare reform law.
     --I want to keep high standards," Clinton said. --They wanted
 control of that pot of money so they'd have more flexibility to
 move people from welfare to work. And in return, they agreed to
 these targets."
     But the president added: --I think most states really are
 working hard and in good faith to try to do this." He said he
 wanted to consult with officials at the Department of Health and
 Human Services to determine whether fines should be imposed.
     HHS spokesman Michael Kharfen walked a similar line last week.
 He said the department has little sympathy for states that have
 known the deadline was coming, but said fines would be considered
 on a state-by-state basis.
     The agency has considerable flexibility to waive penalties,
 which could amount to 5 percent of a state's welfare money. That
 would be as much as $187 million for California, or a few million
 dollars for small states.
     The AP survey found 16 states saying they will not meet the 75
 percent target, and two others saying they probably will not.
 Several other states said they still are unsure if, by the
 deadline, they can get enough parents working 37 1/2 hours a week
 between them.
     It's the first set of standards that states are supposed to meet
 under the new welfare rules, and the shaky results worry many who
 argue that two-parent families are the easiest to put into jobs.
     Federal law also requires states to show by Wednesday that they
 have 25 percent of all welfare families working, and most states do
 expect to meet that goal.


         The percentages of recipients who must be working increase each
     year until 2002, when 50 percent of all families and 90 percent of
     two-parent families must be in work activities.
         A "work activity"   includes a regular job, a subsidized
     position, community service, a limited job search or, for a small
     group, education and training.
         During a brief question-and-answer session with reporters
     Monday, Clinton said that states' difficulty putting people to work
     does not shake his confidence in the success of welfare reform. He
     noted that a smaller percentage of the U.S. population relies on
     welfare today than in any year since 1970.
         "We have succeeded, I think, beyond anybody's expectations,"
     he said.
