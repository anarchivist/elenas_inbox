TEXT:
Here's the deal.  HHS believes that current law is that private citizens
voluneering for the USG, e.g., doctors helping out in a disaster, get the
benefit of the FTCA, i.e., that they're immune from suit, and the USG is
on the hook.  They say it's hard enough to get these folks, and they want
to be able to continue to provide this kind of assurance. They also say
there's some disagreement with DOJ on the extent of the immunity.

This sounds like a reasonable thing to be worried about. We don't use
many volunteers, but when we do, we really want them, and it's in
potentially liability-generating situations.

Given what's likely to happen to this legislation, we tentatively worked
up some language that says that one of our concerns is "we wish to ensure
that this legislation does not affect current law, including the Federal
Tort Claims Act, concerning private citizens who provide volunteer
services for the federal government."

HHS is busily trying to get this cleared within the agency, but who knows
when that might happen.  I've therefore called Fran Allegra and alerted
him to the issue and the proposed solution. He's going to run it by his
FTCA folks to find out what gives.   OBviously, one possibility is that
this statute gives the volunteer MORE protection than they have under the
FTCA and doesn't do anything concerning the USG's responsibility, but I
can think of other possiblities too.

In any event, both Fran and HHS will get back to me.

I've alerted Ingrid Schroeder to the state of play.    The bill is scheduled
to come up on the suspension calendar on Wednesday.

Ellen
