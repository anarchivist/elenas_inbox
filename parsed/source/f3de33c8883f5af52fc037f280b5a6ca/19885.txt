TEXT:
The Finance Committee Tobacco provisions would apply the $1.50/pack tax to
Puerto Rico and the other unincorporated areas (Guam, the Virgin Islands,
Samoa, and the Northern Marianas) but not provide them with a share of the
revenue. Finance Committee Minority staff were unaware of this when I
alerted them to it.

We should try to have this rectified ASAP.
