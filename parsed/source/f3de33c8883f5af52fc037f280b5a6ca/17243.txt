TEXT:
  Our proposal allows states to grant temporary waivers from the work
rules and time limits to victims of domestic violence, which is the
primary goal of the Senate provision.

 However, our proposal achieves this goal through a different mechanism
than the Senate. Rather than exclude victims of domestic violence from
the work rates and time limits altogether, our proposal ensures that
states that fail to meet the work rates or time limit standards because of
domestic violence waivers will not receive financial penalties.

 Our proposal goes further than the Senate in encouraging states to
provide services to victims of domestic violence, exempting states from
penalties only if they provide services based on an individual
assessment.
