TEXT:
A "status offender" is a juvenile who has committed an act that would not
be a crime if committed by an adult.  Examples include truants, curfew
violators and runaways.

According to Justice, the primary reason for detaining status offenders
for a limited amount of time is for purposes of determining appropriate
placement for the youth (e.g., shelter, foster care, return to family).
As I think the response also states, this is codifying a practice that has
been in place.

Does this clarify anything?    Should I re-draft the response?   Let me
know.  Thanks.
