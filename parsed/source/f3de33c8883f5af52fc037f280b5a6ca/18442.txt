TEXT:
Andrew Mayock asked for a longer entry describing what's happened with the
farm group. The first paragraph is basically what we had.   The second
paragraph is what could be added.

Working Group on Highlighting Issues in Farm Policy: The DPC has
established a working group to research and promote high-profile issues of
interest to farmers.  Tom Freedman of DPC is coordinating the working
group, which will eventually include representatives from USDA, NEC, CEA,
Treasury and OPL.

The first meeting of the group focused on significant rural issues that
are suitable for Presidential announcement. Among the topics for further
investigation are the concept of whole farm insurance (insurance that
covers not just a crop but an entire farm's revenue) and IRA-style
accounts for family famers to guard against losses.  In addition, the
group discussed possible topics that deserve mention in the SOTU including
the new cooperatives program, the general economic health of rural
America, and telemedicine programs.
