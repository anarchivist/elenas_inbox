TEXT:
Sally Katzen convened a small meeting on Tuesday with OMB, CEA, and DPC to
make sure we're on the same page about guid,ance to give Commerce and to
layout plan for getting more information about program and budget
implications of various poverty measures.

Guidance to Commerce
Kathy Wallman from OMB will meet with Commerce (statistician to
statistician) to convey EOP guidance:
1. annual CPI adjustments--make sense
2. geographic adjustment--don't spend a lot of time on it (Census will run
various experimental measures whi,ch may be interesting, but while the
concept of geographic adjustment makes sense, there is considerable
concern about how to dO,it.   May just result in massive formula fights and
could open door to adjustments in other programs) .
3. MOOP--explore adjusting on both the threshhold and resource side
4. benchmarking--run some measures without benchmarking so we have
alternatives (Sally is trying to talk to Bruce to make sure he's
comfortable with that)
Timing: if it takes more time to do these things, OK for schedule to slip
1-2 months (til Feb-March 99) .

Analysis of Program/Budget Implications
DPC/NEC process over next several months, with OMB taking lead on
analysis.  Plan is to set up regular meetings every 2 weeks--next one is
Friday 6/26 at 2pm.  Elena, Sally is hoping you'll be able to participate
so you might want to let her know what time works best for you on a
regular basis.  OMB will start with biggest programs (medicaid, food
stamps), but don't ignore smaller ones.  Analysis is complex given that we
don't know what alternatives are. Need to be careful of unintended
consequences and interactions among programs.  Keep this an EOP process
for now--OMB may need to get data from agencies, but they shouldn't be
brought in yet.  Sally continues to mention assessing impact through some
outreach (Bruce, I conveyed to Ceci your feeling that we shouldn't but I
don't know if this has gotten to Sally yet--I don't think any outreach is
imminent, but I'll make sure we discuss this at our next meeting).
