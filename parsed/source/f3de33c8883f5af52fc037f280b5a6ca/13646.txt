TEXT:
out of the office yesterday. catching up on some of the email --
as to the question concerning the origin and purpose of this memo,
it is the overdue response to the request leon and harold made of
the secretary several weeks ago to put together a plan that
clearly demonstrates that we have a strong handle on BOTH the
exact bad sales that we have and that are coming down the pike AND
the alternative timber we are prepared to offer.
from the traffic and from my own brief review of the memo it seems
to fall far short of that.
as to whether this is supposed to be public, the answer is that
this document itself would not necessarily be public. BUT it is
supposed to have the substantive guts that WOULD be public. both
leon and the vp have asked the secy to get his tail out to the
region asap and publicize our strategy.  i suspect that no such
effort is likely in the works.
