TEXT:
Markup for health and welfare will be Tuesday.
Amendments must be filed by noon Monday.

Privatization: Dem Committee staff say they'd like materials on
privatization to help them argue against it. This was contentiously
debated yesteday in the Senators meeting, with of course Phil Gramm
arguing for and Kent Conrad and Bob Kerry raising questions.  I understand
Conrad may have agreed to take the lead to fight this.  I have a call into
his staffer.  I assume I should try to be as helpful as possible? I was
told that if we are really, really going to fight this, we should have
some White House calls go directly to Senators, since most welfare staff
aren't seeing much of their Senators lately with the tax and health
feeding frenzy.  Should Hilley make some calls?

FLSA:  It was not on the 2 pager the majority handed out and Dem staff
have confirmed that it will not be in the mark.  Maybe they've decided
they don't want a debate in the Senate and plan to accept the House
version in conference. What does this mean for the joint Reed/Sperling
letter, which Diana is redrafting?

Welfare to work: Dem staff is trying to verify whether there is a substate
formula which sends funds to high poverty/high unemployment areas.  If
there is not, they will likely have an amendment to do so.
