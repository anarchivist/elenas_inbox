TEXT:
Judy Shepard (Matthew Shepard's mom) called me today to say she was coming
to Washington on February 18-19. She asked to have lunch on the 19th, and
I invited her to come to the Mess. Thought I'd pass it along in case
anyone thinks there's an opportunity to do something more with her while
she's here.  (Looking ahead, she'll be in Wyoming through March 1st, then
in Saudi Arabia through March 20th or so; then, back to Wyoming for the
first defendant's trial).  On a related note: as some of you know, her h
usband and she taped a Dateline NBC interview a couple weeks ago that will
be aired tomorrow night.
