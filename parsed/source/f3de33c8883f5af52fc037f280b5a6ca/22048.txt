Q:   What is today's announcement with regard to Central America?

A:   Last November, in the wake of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch in much of
     Central America, the Attorney General temporarily stayed the removal of nationals in the
     U.S. from Honduras, Nicaragua, EI Salvador, and Guatemala. This stay is set to expire
     on January 7, 1999.

     After consultation with the Department of State, the Attorney General has decided to
     designate Honduras and Nicaragua for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for a period of
     18 months. This action will permit nationals from Honduras and Nicaragua to remain in
     the U.S. and receive work authorization during this period. The Attorney General has
     also decided to extend the stay of removals of El Salvadorans and Guatemalans for 60
     days.
