Governor Cellucci, and the Department were unsuccessful at encouraging all participating
Medicare HMOs to offer a comprehensive drug benefit by this past Tuesday, the HMOs
chose to restructure and reduce their drug benefits to avoid adverse selection from the
sickest of beneficiaries. As a result, while they will still offer drug benefits, they will no
longer have comprehensive benefits that provide for open-ended coverage. Instead, they
will offer extremely limited benefits with maximum pay-out provisions of between $300 to
$800. The plans, particularly the one that ended up being the one hold-out to not joining
the others who were willing to provide comprehensive coverage IF aU plans did, are taking
a public relations beating. However, for the short-term, they have obviously concluded
the financial risks of providing better drug benefits (particularly in an environment when
drug utilization trends are increasing at unprecedented levels) far outweigh any public
perception problems. In the meantime, Senator Kennedy's office still holds out hope that
they will be able to induce the companies to offer some additional wrap-around options to
their enrollees, perhaps grandfathering just those elderly beneficiaries who had become
dependent on the better benefits prior to this year's changes. We are providing Senator
Kennedy's office with technical assistance and they remain appreciative of our role on this
issue.
