TEXT:
Message creation Date was at 10-JUN-1997 11:17:00

I attended the Gallup press conference this morning, which was quite well
covered by the press. This survey is the first of a $10 million corporate
commitment to study black/white race relations over the next decade. Their
survey results present both current findings and trends over time since the
1950's. For our purposes, people were asked (as the Census bureau does) to
identify which racial category they identified with. As such, Hispanics and
other groups (which are technically not racial groups) were included in the
white/black race groups. Only about 6% of the respondents (over 3,000) were
classified as other and where included in the national numbers.   The survey
results are very informative; the major findings were:

* persistent gaps in perceptions of blacks and whites, through with areas of
substantial change over time.

* significant decrease over time in white expression of unfavorable attitudes
towards blacks and such situations as interracial marriage and voting for a
black presidential candidate.

* Whites say they have little prejudice against blacks, that the they desire
mixed race environments, and don't object to mixed race settings to live in and
for their children's schools.

Substantial gaps between blacks and whites remain in the amount of prejudice,
discrimination and equal opportunity seen in the community around them.

* From the white perspective, there are fewer race problems, less
discrimination, an abundance of opportunity for blacks, and only minimal
personal prejudice. Blacks feel the opposite, even though there satisfaction
levels have risen over the years.

* When controlling for income and education, there is much less divergence in
the attitudes between whites and blacks.

* Young black males feel discriminated against more than any other groups and
within the last 30 days, blacks experienced more discrimination shopping than
other situations, e.g., encountering the police, riding public transit, etc.
