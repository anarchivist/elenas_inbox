TEXT:
This is the working group with people from the White House and ED,
primarily, but also from other agencies, that Mike C. convened (I believe
at your request) the Thursday before he took off.   A number of the topics
that we discussed were incorporated in the memo to you from Tom, Mary,
Julie and me re: Hopwood/209.   In general, the expectation is that the
working group is going to be meeting Thursdays at 4, and that folks
working on various issues under this umbrella will update other
participants, but subsequent to the meeting Mike C. and I talked and
decided that it wasn't going to make sense to bring the group together
last week, due to his absence and others. No call yet on next week,
although my sense is that we should wait til Mike gets back for the next
round.
