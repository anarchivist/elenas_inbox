 While this is mainly an NEC event, I wanted to give you all a download on
 Thursday's event becuase of our interest in the literacy portion of it.

The event will take place from approximately 9:45am - 10:30am (15 min.
tour, 30 min. remarks).

The location has not been confirmed as of yet.  Right now it looks like
there are two options: l)Academy of Hope -- located in Columbia Heights,
DC.  The building is a former church (the church donated the building) and
currently houses a program for job skills training (computer training, GED
classes, etc.). OR 2)a new training site, partnership between SEIU and
Georgetown University, a spin-off of a training program at Johns Hopkins.

Program: Sec. Herman will not be able to attend, so they will probably
have another Labor Dept. rep. on the program, a real person tbd, and the
POTUS. Possibility of having Mayor Williams and/or Congo Norton also.

This is as far as they've gone for now.  Let me know if you have any
questions, or need me to look into anything specific.  Thanks!
