TEXT:
Thanks again for helping me get an answer to Graham's letter.  In case you
don't have it, here is the part of the letter that I need your help on:

" ... As you know, in August 1997, the State of Florida settled a lawsuite
with the tobacco industry for over eleven billion dollars. Governor
Chiles has begun to use these funds to implement anti-tobacco programs and
to fund the largest children's health insurance expansion in the State's
history.    Unfortunately, by laying claim to settlement funds as federal
Medicaid dollars, the Health Care Financing Administration threatens to
scuttle Governor Chiles' initiatives and leave hundreds of thousands of
Florida's children uninsured.    It is my hope that with the
Administration's support, we can clarify legislatively that settlement
funds belong to the settling state, not to the federal government.    In
fact, the National Governors Association ranks this issue as its top
priority for the remainder of the session.    I would very much appreciate
the opportunity to work together with you to solve this critical problem.

Again, if at all possible, I'd love to get this by 3pm.
