TEXT:
I guess I didn't succeed in holding back Maria's call to Becerra -- though
I also know that Becerra's staff has been calling around trying to find
out what we're up to.  This just confirm's my line in the memo that our
approach would not be warmly received by the Hispanic Caucus.  I bet it
also reduces the odds that the VP makes any public statements on this
issue.

Just spoke to Esther in Congo Becerra's office. The Congressman has been
unable to connect with Maria. He wanted us to know that he would oppose a
3 year "goal" for bilingual eduacation. I will leave it to others to
pursue this with him if interested.
