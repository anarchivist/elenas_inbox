      That's a long sentence for USA Today. How about something like, "No
      parent should be able to switch jobs or cross state lines to avoid'paying
      child support. This deadbeat data bank [OR "powerful new tool"] will help
      us track down parents who owe child support and deduct it from their
      paychecks."

      Rahm's out of town, but you should run it by Barry.

      Bruce wanted Melissa Skolfield to get the President into the child support
      story she's giving to USA Today today.  She thinks Rich Wolf will put in
      his story a quote from the President.  Please review this quote.  Once
      you've reviewed, I presume I should get Rahm and Barry Toiv to look at it
      as well?

      DRAFT QUOTE:

      This powerful   new child support collection tool -- part of the
      comprehensive   legislation I proposed in 1994 and signed into law in 1996
      -- will track   down deadbeat parents so we can take the child support they
      owe right out   of their paychecks.
