>
>             1.Terms of the new AG settlement to be released Friday remain
>               unchanged vs. prior expectations. For all 51 states, the deal could
>               cost $230 billion ($190 billion incremental for 47 states), with
>               approximately $5 billion in upfront money (total $10 billion over 5
>               years) and $4.5 billion in ongoing payments due in 1999. The
>               ongoing payments level off at $8 billion per year in Year 5 (2003).
>
>             2.We believe at least 40 of the remaining 47 states (including Puerto
>               Rico) will sign the accord, including both CA and NY. Potential
>               holdout states will likely be MA, MD, MO, WI, and MI -- all who
>               have 1999 trial dates. Our sources in California AG Dan Lungren's
>               office have suggested they will brief AG-elect Lockyer by next
>               week, but still sign the accord by the opt-in date.
>
>             3.We expect the industry to take $. 15/pack in additional pricing
>               between now and year-end -- including $.075/pack pricing as soon
>               as Friday. Over the past year, average cigarette prices, net of
>               promotions, have increased by $.21/pack (+12.4%). Philip Morris
>               has already increased its average 4Q deal on Marlboro to
>               $3.00/carton (from $2.50/carton) to cushion the impact of higher
>               prices.
>
>             4.Marketing restrictions are largely those from Minnesota -- bans on
>               billboards and transit signs, on promotional merchandise with brand
>               logos, and on product placements in movies -- plus a new ban on
>               cartoons in advertising; restricting each company to one sports


>        sponsorship per year; and limiting the size of indoor and outdoor
>        retail signage to 14 square feet.
>
>      S.The renegade provisions are largely those agreed to last month:
>
>             Renegade multiplier: The industry would get a credit equal to
>             3x the share points lost to non-signatories, multiplied by the
>             annual payment (e.g. $8 bill. payment; if non-signatory share
>             grows to 7.S% from 2.S% now, credit = $1.2 billion).
>             Renegade exemption: States that enact legislation forcing
>             non-signatories to pay into trust (for fuure claims) the amount
>             they would pay under the deal -- payments which would not
>             be tax deductible -- would be exempted from any renegade
>             credits.
>             Renegade carve-out: Non-signatories to the deal will be
>             granted a "carve out" for 1997 share. This effectively allows
>             smaller players to be covered by the deal at no cost (but take
>             prices up like everyone else) up to their 1997 share levels.
>             Renegade civil litigation clause: States will agree on a best
>             efforts basis to bring claims based on violation of consumer
>             protection statutes against non-signatories to the deal, and
>             possibly against retailers who carry non-signatory product.
>             Renegade credit allocation: The compromise reached
>             between PM, RJR, and B&W was that up to a certain level,
>             credits would be awarded to those who actually lost share to
>             non-signatories; beyond that level, it would allocated on
>             market share.
>
>      6.0ur expectation is that UST has reached a separate settlement with
>        the AGs that requires no ongoing payments, and only nominal
>        upfront payments (legal fees, and some upfront money for public
>        health initiatives) but which commits UST and other smokeless
>        makers to the same ma~keting concessions to which the cigarette
>        manufacturers have agreed
>
>      7.We see little sentiment among Clinton's inner circle to push for a
>        large federal excise tax increase on cigarettes in 1999. Republicans
>        control both House and Senate; a $.lS/pack tax increase
>         ($.10/pack in 2000 and $.OS/pack in 2002) has already been
>        passed. Tobacco was a huge non-issue in the 1998 elections
>         (defeats of AGs Humphrey and Harshbarger proof). The trial
>        balloon in the WSJ may simply be a reminder to the states that the
>        federal government could claim its share of the settlement under
>        HCFA
>
>   Investment Conclusions: We reiterate outperform ratings on Philip
>   Morris, RJR, and UST. With the announcement of the deal largely
>   discounted, the catalyst now is any fresh evidence that substantially all
>   47
>   states will embrace the new deal within the 7-day opt-in period (e.g.
>   public
>   statement by California AG Dan Lungren that CA will sign). We look for
>   buybacks at Philip Morris and UST to begin within two weeks; another
>   large cigarette price hike within a week, and spinoffs to be announced by
>   early-1999.
