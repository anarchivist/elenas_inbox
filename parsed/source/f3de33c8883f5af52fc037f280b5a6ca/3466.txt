Mark-up Update:

If Hatch doesn't get tied up on the floor with the Joel Klein nomination,
mark-up will start at 2pm, and gun amendments are likely to come up.
Specifically, DOJ mentioned that the juvie Brady provision is likely to be
voted on. No mark-up is scheduled for tomorrow, but all of Thursday will
dedicated to marking up the juvenile crime bill.

Also, the House juvenile/prevention bill is being debated on the floor
today, and scheduled to be voted on under suspension.
