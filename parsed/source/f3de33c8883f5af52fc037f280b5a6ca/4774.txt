TEXT:
Gomperts is pushing very hard to find out if they can launch their
reauthorization proposal before Congress leaves. He is not pushing for a
WH event now, but just a green light to send it to the Hill. He knows
Hilley's bottom line that the approps be settled, but those are just about
done. The only outstanding question is how much America Reads money they
will get from Labor/HHS. Do you have a problem in telling them they can
go forward at the end of this month or the beginning of November, assuming
America Reads is settled by then?
