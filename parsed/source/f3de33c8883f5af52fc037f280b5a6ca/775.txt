TEXT:
I am delinquent in getting back to you on a question you asked about
Washington's request that we sell them food stamps. You asked what was
happening, and if it is too late to pursue with USDA the notion of
allowing this.                                      .

It's not too late.  The new Governor still hasn't formally communicated to
USDA whether he likes the old Governor's proposal in this area or not, but
informally they hear he will probably want it, perhaps in modified form.
So there's no rush and it's still active.  USDA continues to have major
legal doubts and some policy doubts.  Ken agrees with you that he'd like
to try it if possible.  I have a memo from his staff that I will pass
along to you.  And, as you can see from the attached, Ken is setting up a
meeting for next Wednesday with USDA to pursue this further.  So, while my
slowness may have caused OMB to get the upper hand again in scheduling
meetings, perhaps we can make progress together with them on the substance.

(FYI, I suspect a lot of the issue at the meeting will be whether this can
be done from a legal perspective.)
