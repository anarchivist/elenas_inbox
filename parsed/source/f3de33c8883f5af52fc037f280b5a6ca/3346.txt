TEXT:
I have received inquiries from the press (Kenen at Reuters) and agencies
about the statement in the Post that "advisers ... plan to rewrite the
proposal themselves ... " They are seeking to confirm that we have indeed
reached this conclusion, and they are also asking whether we are planning
to rewrite the entire settlement, multiple sections, or just the nicotine
section.

Your thoughts? I believe it is important we retain the strategic option
of engaging the Hill by laying out principles legislation must meet, but
leave the writing to them. We could do principles and some writing on
particularly important sections like nicotine regulation.
