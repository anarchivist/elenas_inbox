MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report




        Crime -- Community Prosecutors Initiative: Next Friday, you are set to launch a new
community prosecutors initiative at the National Conference of Mayor's event. YourFY 99
budget request contains $50 million for a new federal grant program to build on the success of
community policing and enable the Administration to help prosecutors' offices join with their
police departments in making use of community-based crime strategies. Similar to the COPS
Program, direct, competitive grants would be used to increase the number oflocal prosecutors
interacting directly with members of the community ("community prosecutors" or "neighborhood
DAs") and to encourage local prosecutors to reorient their emphasis to solving specific crime and
quality of life problems in their communities. Some of the cities that have already started to
embrace some form of community prosecution include: Portland, Boston, Denver, Chicago,
Indianapolis, Kansas City, New York, Milwaukee, Austin, and Washington, DC.

        Crime -- Federal Law Enforcement Officers: On Sunday, the Justice Department will
release a report showing that as of June 1996, the Federal government employed about 74,500
full-time law enforcement officers authorized to make arrests and carry a gun. This is a 6%
increase over the number of officers employed in 1993. The agencies that experienced the
largest percentage increases in officers since 1993 include: the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (31%); U.S. Marshals Service (23%); Federal Bureau of Prisons (13%); and U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service (40%). In 1996, 14% offederal officers were women; 72% were white;
13% were Hispanic; 12% were black; 2% were Asian or Pacific Islander; and I % were American
Natives.

       Education -- NAGB and National Tests: NAGB met this week and voted to make a
number of changes to the test development contract previously awarded by the Department
of Education including, as we feared, to delay the initial administration of the tests for one
year until 2001. A number of our supporters on the Board, including Roy Romer and
Norma Paulus (the Oregon state superintendent), attempted to delay this decision.

                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
Ravitch) who supported the delay.

       Education -- Goodling and National Tests: Goodling has scheduled a mark-up the
day after the State of the Union Address for a bill to prevent further work on test
development (beyond that agreed to in the FY 98 appropriations bill). Secretary Riley has
written to Goodling asking him to delay any further action on the tests until after the
National Academy of Sciences studies authorized in the appropriations compromise are
completed, as was previously agreed to. Civil rights groups that have opposed the test
have also asked Goodling to hold off. On Monday Secretary Riley and Director Raines
will begin briefing members of the Congressional Hispanic and Black Caucuses on our
overall education package and seek their support.

       Education -- Republican Senate Education Package: On Tuesday Senate
Republicans unveiled a package of education initiatives, much of which is similar to
proposals they pursued last year. These include Coverdell's tax-free savings accounts for
education; a block grant proposal; a $75 million voucher demonstration program, a
reading initiative similar to one Goodling passed last year, with an emphasis on teacher
training and assistance to parents, but with no provision for tutoring as in America Reads;
student and teacher safety initiatives; charter school expansion (similar to a House bill you
have already endorsed); and authorization for expanded funding of special education.
