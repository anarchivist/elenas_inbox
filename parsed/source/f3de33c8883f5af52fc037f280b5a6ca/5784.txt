TEXT:
Just spoke with Barbara. She is heading out of town shortly.   In
addition, OMB expects final word from POTUS this evening on appeals. Her
plan is to set up a conference call tomorrow for OMB (her and Barry
White), DPC (you and me), NEC (Gene and Bob), and ED (Mike)   to figure
this out, hopefully with definitive information from POTUS in hand.

Inasmuch as she is leaving shortly, this make sense to me. Are you
available tomorrow, or are you travelling? Should we see if Bruce wants
to participate?
