TEXT:
Friday is the annual certification of countries --   Columbia and Mexico
will make news.

Shalala and McCaffrey are announcing local drug treatment awards Wednesday.

DOJ is announcing $140 million for STOP - Domestic Violence Prevention
grants - this week.   They don't have a date scheduled.

Saturday    4th anniversary of the Brady Bill. DOJ thinking about having
Reno make a statement at the beginning of her press availability on
Thursday.

 (POTUS is in San Francisco Friday and is not doing a message event -- all
of these items would be received well in N. CA.   Do you think POTUS
should issue a written statement on Friday on certification, Brady and/or
domestic violence grants?
