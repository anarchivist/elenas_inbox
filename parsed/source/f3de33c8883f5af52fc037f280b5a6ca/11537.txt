TEXT:
We've got confirmations on all but 2 of the invited groups for the Thurs
a.m. mtg (Susan Frost was working late this afternoon to get those last
two confirmed) .

Broderick reported that the class size amendment would be debated on
Thursday and that there was a slight chance it could go to a vote late in
the day, but debate is expected to continue into next week.  He also
passed along three points he thought should be raised in the meeting with
the groups:

1. We're making good progress in a bipartisan fashion to strengthen
accountability in Ed-Flex, there's no reason not to make similar progress
on class size.

2.   Its really important for the groups to be out fighting for class size.

3. What information do they have on how the Republicans are approaching
the class size issue? (Broderick said he isn't getting any reliable
information)

Lastly,  Mike Cohen said that its now looking likely that the Dept will be
able to complete work on local class size allocations on Thurs   (the
numbers Susan felt would be most helpful for the groups to have).   He'll
have an update for us tomorrow.
