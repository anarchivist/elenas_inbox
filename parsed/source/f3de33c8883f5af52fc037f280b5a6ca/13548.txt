TEXT:
Talked to ellen athas . . . . she has no objection to not
objecting to the stay, but will be briefing Lois in the am on
various options.
The merits issue deals with the Religious Freedom Act.
Our legal position here seems pretty firm - the Act requires the
tribe to act, and the tribe didn't in this case. There is also a
Supreme Ct. ruling on point (the Lyng case).
There is a conference call hrg. tommorrow at 2 pm over the issue
of a bond the judge wants the enviros to post.
Plaintiff's appeal brief is due Monday; our is Wednesday.
The Forest Service in the field is furious that DOJ didn't argue
that cutting trees is not irreperable harm in the argument today.
Katie is fine with not opposing the TRO right now.
Ellen points out that USDA's draft letter (which I should fax to
you) and that says that this sale meets the Forest Plan rather
undercuts our ability to move forward on termination, which it
certainly does. Both Katie and I have the same question - which I
have no answer to yet - as to why this sale was held up in the
first place. Just the 6 acres of old growth? We don't know.

Sorry this is disjointed. Ellen is trying to figure out strategy
for using this as a way to push termination, while the FS is
trying to convince the world that minus the 6 acres this is a Fine
Sale. I need to find out more about the problems with the sale
prior to the rider. All for now.
