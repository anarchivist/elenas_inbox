MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     TOBY DONENFELD

SUBJECT:                  ADDENDUM TO THE KOOP PHONE CALL MEMO


        Since we sent you the phone call memo for your call to Dr. Koop, Senator McCain held a
press conference to announce the liability portion of his tobacco bill. His bill includes a
$6.5 billion annual cap on liability payments and no ban on class action lawsuits. We are
unclear at this time whether or not the bill includes the elimination of punitive damages for past
conduct, although it appears that it will not include such an elimination.

       As we understand it, Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop have been lobbying agressively to not
eliminate class action lawsuits or punitive damages.

        No Administration position on the liability provisions in the McCain bill has been made
public. Erskine's speech occured several hours before McCain released the details on liability.
In general, the White House position has been that we are working to make sure that the bill
encompasses the President's five priniciples, and until it does that, we are not going to discuss
the isssue ofliability.

       As you can see if the side-by-side faxed to you earlier, the settrnent called for a $5 billion
annual cap and the HarkiniChafee bill called for a $12 billion annual cap.

      Early reaction on CNN from Senators Conrad and Dorgan were very negative toward the
McCain bill for granting the tobacco industry "special protections."
