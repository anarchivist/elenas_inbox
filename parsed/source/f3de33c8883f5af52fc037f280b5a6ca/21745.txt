TEXT:
The New York City Council is planning a hearing on the Mayor's Medicaid
and Food Stamp application policies, planned for this Monday the 23rd
(with some rumours that it will be postponed until 12/3) .

The Council has invited USDA and HHS to testify.  I don't think they
should testify (the agencies agree) but I think they should submit short
statements for the record (USDA is prepared to do this and I understand
from Devorah that HCFA is trying to figure out if it can).  Do you think
this is the right strategy?
