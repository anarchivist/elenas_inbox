Elena,
Attached is a draft of the HIB letter to Hyde for the House Judiciary
Committee mark-up on Wednesday.  We need to get this into LRM asap. This
letter is very similar to the one that we sent to Lamar Smith for the
Subcommittee mark-up.
We are trying to get the same three signatories (Daley, Reno and Herman)
that we got for the Senate Judiciary Committee mark-up.

Julie

The Honorable Henry J. Hyde
Chainnan
Committee on the Judiciary
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515


Dear Chainnan Hyde:

        Today, your Committee will mark-up H.R. 3736, the "Workforce Improvement and
Protection Act of 1998" which is intended to address the growing demand for skilled workers in
the infonnation technology (IT) industry by enacting a temporary increase in the annual cap on
the number of visas for temporary foreign "specialty" workers under the H-l B program, while
also effecting refonns to the H-IB program that would help target their usage to industries and
employers that ate actually experiencing skill shortages.

         The Administration believes that the first step in increasing the availability of skilled
workers must be raising the skills of U.S. workers and helping the labor market work better to
match.employers with U.S. workers. Therefore, substantial additional efforts to increase the
skill level of U.S. workers and needed improvements in the H-IB visa program are necessary
prerequisites for the Administration to support any short-tenn increase in the number of visas for
temporary foreign workers.

        We are pleased that H.R. 3736 as reported from the Immigration and Claims
Subcommittee is consistent with one of our primary objectives, insofar as it links a temporary
increase in the H-IB cap to the enactment of meaningful refonns to the H-IB visa program. H.R.
3736 would help ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to temporary foreign workers
and that qualified U.S. workers have the opportunity to fill ajob before a temporary foreign
worker is hired. Moreover, H.R. 3736 modestly expands enforcement authority to help prevent
employer abuses of the H-IB program. These refonns will effectively target H-l B visas to
industries experiencing skill shortages. The Administration strongly opposes amendments that
would weaken these refonns.

        Unfortunately, H.R. 3736 does not contain any provision to encourage additional training
of U.S. workers. Training is a vital component of our strategy to address the long-tenn demand
for highly skilled U.S. workers and to enhance the international competitiveness of important
U.S. industries. An effective training strategy would also work to reduce the demand for H-IB
visas. The Administration strongly supports amending H.R. 3736 to provide for additional
training opportunities for U.S. workers and believes that this training should be funded, in part,
through a modest H-IB application fee paid by employers. The Administration is also
concerned that the increase in the annual number of H -1 B visas reflected in this bill is too large,
although we agree that the increase should last for only three years.

       The Administration believes that H.R. 3736 would substantially improve the current
H-l B program and, with the addition of a meaningful training provision and a modest reduction
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


        in the level of increase in the annual H-IB visa cap, would garner the Administration's support.
        We look forward to working with the Congress on these and other specific provisions in the bill.

              The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the
        submission of this report from the standpoint of the Administration's program.



        Sincerely,
