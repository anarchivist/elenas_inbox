TEXT:
This morning, Sen. Conrad moved to strike the privatization provisions of
the Senate Finance Committee mark, which would deem Texas approved and
allow up to 10 more states to privatize.
        Conrad's motion to strike won.
        Then, clearly there was some back room dealing as other subjects
were debated.
        Then, D'Amato who had voted w/Conrad before, asked for a vote to
reconsider Conrad.   The chairman offered to change his mark to take out
the other states. The vote to reconsider won on a party line vote.
        End result: the Finance Committee deems Texas approved but does
not allow other states to privatize.

We worked hard to provide official and unoffical documents to help
Conrad's efforts.  John -- I'll send a package over to you for your
information.

On other matters, Moseley-Braun's effort to not count teens in the 20% of
case load in vocational education cap passed, but Nickles insisted he
wanted to work with her in drafting to ensure it doesn't weaken the work
requirements. Moseley-Braun apparently told him it didn't, which isn't
really true (The law requires teen parents to be in school to get
assistance.   This wouldn't change that.  This would not count those teens
as being in "vocational education"     which would allow more adults in
vocational education to be counted as "working.")
