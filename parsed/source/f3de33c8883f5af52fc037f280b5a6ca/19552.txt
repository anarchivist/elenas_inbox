TEXT:
We are readying our position on the child support incentives bill.  It's
going pretty much as we would wish.  Both bills have the same'incentives,
which we support.  The chief difference is in the penalty structure. The
penalty percentages are similar, but the Senate is much more generous
because it allows states an extra year to comply without penalty, and lets
them "earn back" prior penalties once they come into compliance. We plan
to favor the House bill since it's tougher.

3 other issues:  1. The House bill includes a Cardin amendment to catch
immigrants who owe a lot of child support at the border -- We presumably
will favor but will propose to target more; INS may have issues.  2. The
Senate bill would create standard form to do medical support orders
(putting kids on non-custodial parents' health insurance) -- we favor, but
DOL may have technical issues.  3. Senate wants to require HHS to discard
data from the New Hire Data Base after 1 year if there is no "hit" on chil
d support. HHS argues that they need it for 2 years to make sure
employers are complying. Also, they want to keep some data indefinitely
to evaluate the success of welfare reform. We're looking into this last
point.

Let me know if any of this seems wrong. Also, you should know that the LA
County DA is stepping up his push for an exemption for LA County from any
Calif. penalty.  He is pushing Karen Skelton, and she is asking us why we
don't agree to their demand.  So far, none of the players on the Hill are
sympathetic to them either, but the heat may get turned up further.
