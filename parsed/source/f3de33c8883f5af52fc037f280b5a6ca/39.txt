TEXT:
FYI
You all may know this, but . . .
The facilities ban in the DC bill (which we understand is out of
the present Conference deal) would not have any real effect.   The
only facility it would affect is DC General, and they do not
perform abortions.
This info is from NARAL - obviously not provided to encourage us
not to oppose the bill, but in the interest of full disclosure.
They feel VERY strongly that the facilities ban is a precedent
setting action that raises the stakes to a different level.  The
whole thing is moot of course if it stays out of the agreement.
I think the representation that the women's groups could live with
signing the DC bill is contingent on this issue and on the ban
being a one-year ban, not a permanent change to the DC Code.
