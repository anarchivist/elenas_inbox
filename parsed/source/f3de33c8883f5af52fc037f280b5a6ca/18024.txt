SUBJECT:       SSA Report on Implementation of Children's SSI Cutoffs

DATE:December 5,1997

As you know, the welfare law tightened the definition of childhood disability for SSI, and
required the Social Security Administration to redetermine the eligibility of approximately
288,000 children (out of one million children now on the rolls). Advocates charge that SSA has
done a poor job on these reevaluations, causing eligible children to be dropped from the rolls.
At his confirmation hearing, Commissioner Ken Apfel promised a "top to bottom" review of
SSA's process. This memo summarizes that report, which is nearing completion and will be
released in about a week.

Overall, SSA concludes that the organization did a good job in redetermining eligibility for these
children. However, the report identified three areas of concern (described further in an
attachment), along with actions to address them.

As a result of this review, SSA will review the cases of approximately 70,000 children
terminated from the program, out of a total of 136,000 terminations to date. All children
terminated who were coded as having mental retardation will have their cases reviewed. SSA
will also review all terminations in the ten states with the lowest accuracy rates (D.C.,
Mississippi, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Idaho, Maryland, North Carolina, Washington, Tennessee,
and California). Finally, SSA will offer all 75,000 families who did not appeal SSA's
termination decision a new opportunity to do so.

The report will include a lower projection of the number of children who will ultimately lose SSI
after all appeals are completed -- 102,000 children, compared to SSA's original projection of
135,000. This drop of33,000 is caused by a reestimate of the baseline (23,000 cases) and the
actions announced in this report (10,000 cases). At the time the welfare law was enacted, the
estimate was that 180,000 children would lose SSI.

With the report, SSA also plans to release case studies of a random sample of 150 children who
have lost benefits. This document is intended to explain to the public what types of children are
no longer eligible. Most of the children have mental disabilities other than mental retardation,
including learning disabilities and ADHD. Over a third have improved since they were first
found eligible. The majority are teenagers; only a handful are age six or younger.

Advocates will probably view the report's actions positively, but they are more concerned that
about SSA's regulation interpreting the statute, which they view as needlessly strict. The report
does not address this issue. The Republican leadership in Congress has been extremely
supportive ofSSA's actions to date, but it is possible they will criticize this report, perhaps

                                                                              Hex-Dump c~;~~'!1ent System

SSA's report examined three areas of concern raised by advocacy groups:

I. Mental Retardation
Advocates' Charge: Too many children with mental retardation were cut from the rolls.

SSA Finding: Of the 136,000 children terminated to date, 42,000 were "coded" as mentally
retarded (MR). However, most of these children do not actually have MR, because until recently
SSA's systems did not have all the necessary codes. Instead, most of these children have other
mental disorders, such as learning disabilities and or "borderline intellectual functioning" (which
falls short of full-fledged MR). However, some unknown subset of the 42,000 do have MR, but
either their impairments are not severe enough to qualify them for SSI, or they were denied
incorrectly.

Even with these terminations, about 360,000 children with MR will remain on the rolls, out of
the total of one million children on SSI.

SSA Action: SSA will review all cases terminated that were coded as MR, to ensure that all
those decisions were made properly.

II. State Variations in Cutoffs
Advocates' Charge: Errors in cutoffs appear likely, since termination rates varied widely by
state, from 32% in Nevada to 82% in Mississippi. Also, SSA may not have acquired all
documentation, such as school records, needed to judge a child's disability. Finally, some states
were disqualifying too many families for failure to cooperate without making adequate efforts to
reach them.

SSA Findings: SSA data show that on average 93% of termination decisions were both
accurate and complete in terms of including all required documentation. This exceeds SSA's
required level of state performance for SSI. However, 10 states had accuracy/completion rates
below 90%. Another 9 states had accuracy/completion rates below the national average.
(SSA's experience is that about one-third ofthe errors identified in these measures will
ultimately prove to be accurate decisions that simply lacked documentation.) SSA found that
many inaccurate decisions stem from an overly strict interpretation of the new rules for children
who exhibit maladaptive behavior.

Claims that SSA did not acquire all needed documentation were determined to be unfounded.
However, SSA found wide state variations in the percentage of children cut off because their
families did not cooperate. In the four states with the highest rates, 68% of the cases did not
include documentation that all required efforts to contact the family had been made.

                                                                 Automated Records Management SYstem
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conve:oion -
                                               -2-

SSA then perfonned a regression analysis intended to detennine whether wide state to state
variations in overall tennination rates should be expected because of legitimate factors, such as
the child's age and impainnent and whether the child was initially added to the rolls based on the
less strict criteria eliminated by the welfare law. SSA found that these factors would lead you to
expect the cutoff rate to vary from 40% in Idaho to 78% in Mississippi. While this regression
analysis does not fully explain the actual state-by-state variance, it does convince SSA that the
vast majority of the variance among states is not due to errors, but to characteristics of the
children.

SSA Action: In states with accuracy/completion rates below 90%, SSA will review all cases. In
states with accuracy/completion rates between 90% and 93%, SSA will review a sample of cases
to see if additional reviews are needed. SSA will also provide more training on maladaptive
behavior. In states where the rate of children dropped due to failure to cooperate is above the
national average, SSA will review all cases.

III. Appeal Rights
Advocates' Charge: Too few families are appealing because SSA's notice to families was
confusing, and workers discouraged appeals. Also, SSA discouraged families from requesting
that benefits be continued during the appeal.

SSA Finding: SSA found that its workers did not discourage appeals. At the same time, a poll
conducted by SSA confinns that many families did not understand their appeal rights.

SSA Action: All 75,000 families of children who were tenninated and did not appeal will be
given a new opportunity to do so. All 30,000 families of children who appealed but did not
request continuation of benefits during the appeal will also be given a new opportunity to make
that request. SSA will also publicize the availability of free legal services for families.
