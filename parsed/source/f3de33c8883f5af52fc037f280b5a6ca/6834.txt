TEXT:
Sally, Jon Orszag, and I met with Daschle's staff. They've agreed to drop
their data collection section of the bill (which requires employers to
keep wage data and to submit reports to the EEOC). We agreed that we
could still recognize the importance of data collection, without
mentioning the EEOC explicitly, by including a sense of the Senate in the
bill to recognize the need to take additional steps to improve data
collection on this issue. DOJ is drafting some legislative language to
add mention of the 14th Amendment to the findings, and to draft the
language so that punitive damages are not available against the Federal
Government.    We are going to try to get Daschle's staff this language by
tomorrow.   I will send a copy for your review when I receive it from DOJ.
Because Daschle's bill currently mentions funding for the EEOC and Labor,
we're also going to consult with OMB how best to draft any language on
this issue.
