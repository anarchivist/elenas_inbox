BR/EK:

I wanted to follow-up on our conversation this morning w/respect to the
COPS Report/Radio Address and mention a few other quick crime tid bits:

1. DOJ says they can't make Elena's suggested graph on the crime rates
work for a variety of reasons ("too many apples and oranges").   For one,
the model cities don't necessarily beat the national average on overall
crime rates. And for two, many of our major grantees don't necessarily
have enough of their cops "on the street" to claim any credit.   In any
event, they want to pursue this line, but feel it's too early _.- and their
are too many differences between cities -- to do this right now.   They
have, however, put together a graph showing the violent crime index
increasing slightly from 1991 to 1993 (+0.75%) and dipping dramatically
(-6.1%) from 1993 to 1996 -- the year our COPS program began.

What do you think? Have you talked to Rahm?   Please advise or I'll assume
we've finally bailed on this report.

2. Gil Gallegos meeting. EK -- Do we need to get a memo to Erskine on
the collective bargaining issue to try and bring this to closure, or is
this already in the works? The FOP folks are still pushing for a POTUS
meeting.

3. Curios and Relics. Barry Toiv sent Rahm and me a note on what we can
or can't say on the curios and relics amendment in the Treasury-Postal
approps.  I understand that, while we are strongly opposed, Rahm was
cautioned that we could not use the V-word -- is this right? Treasury is
sending over some updated info on this in the a.m. and Leanne or I will
re-work it into a Q&A for McCurry before the 1pm briefing.

4. Senate Leg. Affairs has asked me to fill-in some facts on a "call
sheet" for POTUS to Senator Feinstein on assaults. It's a re-hash of old
issues (grandfathered clips, assault copy cats and gun shows) that I'm
pretty sure are either undoable or require new legislation.  I told Leg.
Affairs that I though it was a waste for the Pres. to call Senator
Feinstein and possibly agree to a meeting (which is what she wants) on
these issues. What we should do is send Ray Kelly over to her office to
walk her through the substance of this stuff. Anyway, I can't imagine
that any good will come out of this proposed call/meeting.

Thanks,
         ,.
       Jose'
