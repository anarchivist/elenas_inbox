Subject: GOP could lose House majority if if focuses on moral issues

(Expanded version of an earlier story)

ASSOCIATED PRESS, July 27, 1998
GOP Polls Voters on Issues
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
     WASHINGTON (AP) - The Republican Party could lose its House majority
this
fall if its candidates focus too closely on such moral issues as abortion
and
homosexuality, GOP moderates say, pointing to a new poll.
     The party is likely to increase its margin in the House if candidates
press Republican positions on the economy, education and crime, according
to
the poll released on Monday.
     Commissioned by the Republican Leadership Council, the poll surveyed
800
likely voters in the 77 congressional districts where Republicans won or
lost
in 1996 by 10 percentage points or less. Conducted by the firm of Kieran
Mahoney and Associates between July 17-20, the survey had a margin of
error of
plus or minus 3.5 percent.
     It concluded that voters primarily concerned with moral issues are
unlikely to desert the GOP even if those issues are not the centerpiece of
campaigns.
     Indeed, 82.7 percent of such voters say they will probably or
definitely
vote for the Republican candidate, the poll indicated.
     Asked to choose overall, 36.9 percent of the people surveyed said they
currently would vote for a Republican candidate, 35.6 percent said they
would         .
vote Democratic and 27.5 percent said they were undecided.
     But the poll indicated that pluralities in the voting center - ticket
splitters, moderates and independents - currently favor the Democratic
candidate in their district.
     When asked to name the issues they were most interested in, just 12.1
percent named moral issues, the survey said. But 40.5 percent named
economic


issues such as taxes and 32.4 percent cited social issues such as
education,
health care and the environment.
     --If the Republican party addressed these issues they would not only
keep
their base unified, they would attract large numbers of Democrats, ticket
splitters, independents and moderates and expand their congressional
majority, " the poll concluded.
     It said 57.9 percent of poll respondents opposed legislating a moral
agenda, with 58.2 percent of registered Republicans opposing a litmus test
requiring all GOP candidates to oppose certain late-term abortions before
receiving party support.
     --If Republicans focus on moral issues there is a real chance we will
lose
the House of Representatives,"   poll taker Mahoney told reporters.
     Separately on Monday, the chairman of the Republican Senatorial
Campaign
Committee said GOP candidates plan to focus on local issues rather than
sweeping national themes.
     --The fall election is likely to be an issueless election, " said Sen.
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. "The challenge for us is to help our
candidates
custom-craft campaigns to meet the conditions in their states and their
particular opponents."
     wishful thinking, Democrats scoff. President Clinton has accused
congressional Republicans of accomplishing little this election year while
stymieing bills on tobacco and campaign finance reform.
     --Republicans want to have an issueless campaign because they have no
real
answers on the issues voters care about, like education, Social Security
and
HMO reform, " said Dan Sallick, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
