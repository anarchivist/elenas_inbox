TEXT:
1.    There is a danger in reporters getting different spins on what the
report means from different agencies. To combat that; (a) I've talked to
O'hara and USDA who agree they are on our line: we are endorsing a single
voice, this is a step in the process, we will be evaluating objectively
the different models for best achieving a single voice; (b) we shouldn't
have them as our first line of spin plus they agreed the release shouldn't
list several names as press contacts (incongruous for a release regarding
the need for a single voice).   We're planning on listing a WH person as
the contact      Lorrie McHugh is talking to Lockhart about who should
field the calls -- I'd be fine with her doing it. Then forwarding calls
to Neal, Bruce, HHS or USDA if appropriate.

2.   We are shooting for a noon release of the report on Monday.

3. The draft press release from the agencies was awful.   We are rewriting
it.  I suspect we will be fighting into the weekend.
