MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                       GENE SPERLING

SUBJECT:               Auto Choice


Overview:

        The purpose of the memorandum is to provide you with information on auto-insurance
reform and the "Auto Choice" legislation introduced last April by a bipartisan coalition of
Members of Congress. Over the last several months, a NEC-DPC inter-agency working group
has spent considerable time analyzing the Auto Choice proposal and reviewing other
auto-insurance reform options. It is the strong view of.the working group that the benefits of
the various Auto Choice proposals considered by the working group do not justify the cost.

        Despite the claims by proponents of Auto Choice that it will reduce insurance
premiums by approximately $250 per year for the average driver, the working group found little
support that no-fault insurance would lead to lower rates. For example, the three states that
currently mandate insurance companies to offer no-fault insurance plans (New Jersey, Kentucky,
and Pennsylvania), have sOme of the highest rates in the country and have not seen rates fall
since no-fault was implemented. Our analysis also suggests that with Auto Choice bad drivers
will benefit more than good drivers. In addition, if Auto Choice does induce reduced
premiums, more people will drive leading to more accidents, increased environmental
degradation, and greater strain on our infrastructure.

Background:

        "No-fault" insurance, in its broadest sense, is defined as any auto insurance program that
 allows policyholders to recover financiallossesjrom their own insurance company, regardless of
fault. In its strictest form, no-fault applies only to state laws that both provide for the payment
of no-fault first-party benefits and restrict the right to sue. "Pure" no-fault proposals go one step
further, abolishing the right to sue in the majority of cases.

       Under current state-level no-fault laws, motorists may sue for severe injuries and for pain
and suffering only if the case meets certain conditions .· These conditions, known as a
"threshold," relate to the severity of injury. They may be expressed in verbal terms (a
descriptive or verbal threshold) or in dollar amounts of medical bills (a monetary threshold).
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

Some laws also include the days of disability incurred as a result of the accident. The academic
evidence shows that verbal thresholds have a significant effect on lowering insurance premiums.
However, the evidence suggests that monetary thresholds can actually lead to higher premiums
because people have an incentive to exaggerate their medical bills so that they can sue for pain
and suffering.

Proposals:

         The workirig group has considered three options. The first is the Auto Choice
legislation introduced by Senators McConnell and Moynihan and Representative Armey. Under
this proposal, drivers in states who accept the new federal legislation have a choice between the
existing system in their state and a strict no-fault plan (called 'personal protection insurance'
(PPI). A driver who chooses the PPI option gets first-party coverage for economic damages
(mostly medical and lost wages), without regard to fault; a PPI driver can sue or be sued for
economic damages above policy limits. PPI drivers cannot sue or be sued for non-economic
damages ('pain and suffering'), although exceptions are made for accidents involving drug or·
alcohol abuse. A driver who opts to stay in the state's current tort system must purchase tort
maintenance coverage (TMC) to cover accidents with PPI drivers.

        The second proposal was developed by CEA to achieve the same ends as Auto Choice --
lower premiums -- but to do so while reducing environmental and human costs. The CEA
proposal would amend the Auto Choice to require insurance companies to offer premiums on a
per-mile basis. Per-mile premiums would be charged based on an estimate of miles, with a
rebate or surcharge issued every year after an odometer reading. Odometers could be read at
existing emissions or safety inspections or by firms under contract with insurance companies.
Insurance companies would compete in their per-mile premium, subject to current regulations;
premiums would consequently vary with region, driving record, type of car, and safety features,
much as premiums vary now.

        The third proposal would attack the major reason for high insurance costs, fraud. Under
this proposal, we would announce support for legislation that would 1) increase penalties on
lawyers and doctors who participate in auto insurance fraud claims, including possibly taking
away licenses to practice law or medicine; 2) encourage insurance companies to install V-Chips
into odometers so they could check the mileage of drivers at random and reduce premiums for
those who drive less and increase premiums for those who drive more.

Analysis:

       There are a number of problems with each of these proposals. For example, all three
proposals do not guarantee that insurance companies will pass on savings to consumers. In
many states that currently have no-fault insurance systems, there is little evidence that over the
long-term consumers saved compared to the period when no-fault was not mandated. In
addition, since state iegislatures can currently choose to adopt Auto Choice or the Perc Mile
approach, it is not clear why the Federal government should enter into an issue that has been
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

traditionally the responsibility of state governments. Moreover, since the Per-Mile Premium and
V -Chip proposals would require monitoring of miles driven by individuals, opponents could
argue that these proposals are nothing more than "big brother" intervention into people's lives.
        As noted above, proponents of the Auto Choice legislation claim that premiums for the
average driver will be reduced· by $250 per year. This reduction reflects the fact that motorists
will no longer be covered for pain and suffering, which accounts for about one-third of auto
insurance premium rates. However, a reduction in auto insurance premiums would have the
unintended consequence of increasing the number of miles driven which would lead to more
accidents, highway deaths, congestion, and environmental degradation.

        While the Per-Mile Premium option addresses this problem, we feel that we could not
sustain support for it. While we would argue that the average premium for drivers would fall
under CEA's proposal, opponents would counter that we are "taxing" each mile that
middle-income families drive. This is a battle would be difficult, if not impossible, to win.

         The McConnell-Armey Auto Choice legislation has additional adverse consequences.
For example, safe drivers who maintain their current coverage will see their premiums increase
because they will need to pay to cover their own economic and non-economic losses when they
are not at fault. State regulation could in principle prevent the premium rise for safe drivers, but
it is not clear that current regulations in Choice states do this.

          Furthermore, as with Medical Savings Accounts, while proponents of Auto Choice claim
 to provide choice, motorists may end up having no choice at all. Premiums for bad drivers
 who switch to PPI will fall more than premiums for good drivers who switch. The resulting
,self-selection of bad drivers into PPI will exacerbate the above problem of rising rates for safe
 drivers who maintain their current coverage, As their premiums rise, more people will switch to
 PPI, thus further raising premiums for the safest drivers, These increases in TMC premiums
 could effectively remove any real 'choice' between the two systems. However, in the three states
 that currently offer Choice, state regulation prevents the competitive rate setting that would
 produce this self selection and hence 'choice' may be preserved.

        While Auto Choice has wide bipartisan support -- from Senator McConnell to Senator
                                  ,
Moynihan and from Grover Nyquist to Mike Dukakis -- the legislation will be strongly opposed
by the trial lawyers, consumer groups, and possibly State governments. We expect
environmentalists and auto safety groups to also oppose this legislation.

Recommendation:

      The NEC, DPC, Office of White House Counsel, and the Office of the Vice President
recommend you oppose Auto Choice legislation.
