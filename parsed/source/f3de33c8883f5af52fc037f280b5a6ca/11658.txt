Justice (John Jennings is contacting)

Outstanding (follow-up?)

-- Jesse Jackson? No concensus on inviting. Ben would defer to Minyon.
    Rep. Conyers and Clyburn? Chuck thinks we should invite; Ben was
willing to hold-out.
    Mayors? None currently on list. Chuck thought yes; Ben suggested Lee
Brown.


 Finally, if we add 2 or 3 more civil rights/congressional types,   I want 1
 or 2 more law enforcement folks.  The group should be balanced.
