H.R. 1252 - Judicial Reform Act of 1998
(Hyde (R) Illinois and 8 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 1252, as
reported by the Judiciary Committee, because:

 It purports to restrict the remedial powers of Article III Federal courts
to enforce constitutional rights.  Under current law, Federal district
courts may compel State and local governments to levy taxes in excess of
their State law taxing powers when such a remedy would be required to
enforce a Federal constitutional right.  In addition, Federal courts have
long been held to possess the equitable authority to compel State and
local government to exercise their existing taxing authority even when the
Federal constitution would not require imposition of such a remedy.   The
proposed restrictions would curtail the equitable discretion of Federal
district courts, as well as deprive them of the power to remedy certain
constitutional rights.  The latter deprivation of power raises
constitutional concerns and would be subject to reasonable constitutional
challenge. (section 5)

 It requires the use of a three judge panel for certain injunctions and
declaratory actions - a process that is cumbersome, confusing, and
inefficient, which in all likelihood will result in fewer judges having
the opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of voter initiatives and
referenda.  Additionally, this provision would adversely affect the
operation of several preemptive Federal statutes intended to preempt the
field, where a State has passed a referendum that is contrary to Federal
law. Lastly, this provision is objectionable because it would provide
unprecedented direct and immediate access to the Supreme Court, even when
the three-judge court denies injunctive relief. (Section 2)

 It would give parties in civil cases the right to exercise preemptive
strikes against Article III judges,. without even a requirement to show
cause. Such a procedure threatens to undermine the independence of the
Federal judiciary that Article III of the constitution was intended to
secure, as well as undermine the public's confidence in life-tenured and
constitutionally appointed Federal judges as impartial adjudicators.
Litigants assuredly will engage in judge and forum shopping -- sometimes
with improper motives. Additionally, these peremptory strikes will add
further delay to the civil litigation system and erode the rule of law.
(section 6)
