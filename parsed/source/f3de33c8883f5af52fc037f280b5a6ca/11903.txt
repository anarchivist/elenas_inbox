TEXT:
Spoke with Judy Shepard this morning; she'd be available to participate in
a Good Friday radio address taping (or some other event) on hate crime,
but would have trouble doing it after that because the first murder trial
of one of her son's attackers begins in Wyoming three days later on
Monday, April 5.
