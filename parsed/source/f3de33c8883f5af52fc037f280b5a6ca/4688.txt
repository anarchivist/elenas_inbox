TEXT:
I am in the process of circulating via fax a further-revised version of
the Labor letter on the Worker Paycheck Fairness Act.   Please review and
advise me of any changes or problems by 4:30 p.m. today. We plan to clear
the letter by COB today, to allow the Department of Labor to send it to
the Committee prior to tomorrow morning's markup.

If you did not receive the revised draft, please call me at 5-7887 and
I'll resend it.

Thanks!
