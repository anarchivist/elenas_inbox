    MEMORANDUM FOR            ERSKINE BOWLES

    FROM:                     Ellen Seidman, NEC

    SUBJECT:                        securities litigation reform
    Background
    At the end of 1995, President Clinton vetoed a securities
    litigation reform bill that, among other things, limited
    discovery, changed pleading standards and created a "safe harbor"
    for forward
    o
    -looking information.  Congress overrode the veto.
    Concerned that plaintiffs' attorneys would bring actions in state
    courts that had been made more difficult or impossible in federal
    court, during the California Republican primary California
    business interests attempted to pass referenda that would have
    instituted changes such as "loser pays." These failed.
    The plaintiffs' bar, supported by labor and some parts of the
    pension community, as well as the California Democratic Party,
    then proposed Proposition 211, which was on the November ballot.
    Business interests vigorously opposed Prop 211.   The referendum
    would have established procedural rules for securities fraud
    suits in California courts that not only were far more favorable
    to plaintiffs than the federal rules, but that also applied to
    any company with any California shareholders.   Business interests
    asserted this would have effectively overriden the federal
    statute, making California a haven for frivolous securities fraud
    suits from allover the country.
    On a campaign trip to California, which included a dinner with
    representatives of the high tech community, the President and
    Leon Panetta stated (and were quoted in the press) that Prop 211
    was a bad idea. They also said it was a mistake for each state


 to establish its own rules regarding an essentially federal body
 of law. There are certainly people in the community who believe
 the President said he would support a preemptive federal statute.
 Prop 211 lost 75% to 25%. And as Congress adjourned last year,
 it passed a securities law reform bill that preempts state
 registration laws for most corporations and can be read,
 aggressively, as preempting state fraud actions based on those
 laws.
 Current state of play


 In February, the SEC will deliver to the President a report he
 requested outlining the impact of the securities litigation
 o
 reform law. Their preliminary conclusion appears to be that,
 while it is very early in the process, the act does not seem to
 have had much impact either in reducing litigation or in
 increasing information available under the "safe harbor." It is
 far too early to know the impact on potential litigation of the
 1996 statute.
 Passing preemptive federal statutes -- particularly laws that
 interfere with the procedures and operations of state courts --
 is extremely difficult.  Senator Dodd made this point last fall
 in wondering why we would favor preemption, although he thought
 there might be a case for such a statute if Prop 211 passed. We
 understand that Congressman Oxley (R
 o
 -Ohio), who business
 interests expected to sponsor a preemptive statute, has declined
 on the grounds that it's unneeded, too difficult, and not the
 kind of thing conservative Republicans like to do.   Congressman
 Joe Kennedy is said to be working on a preemptive statute, but it
 is unclear how far he has gotten.
 We have been silent on the issue since the election.
