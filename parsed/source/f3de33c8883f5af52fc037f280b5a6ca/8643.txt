TEXT:
According to Cabinet Affairs, POTUS will do a radio actuality announcing
release of CA WTW grant.  DOL has signed off on the CA plan, even though
the assurances it makes on FLSA are not exactly comforting (we'll comply
in order to receive WTW, but this does not mean we agree w/ DOL's FLSA
guidelines). Karen Tramantano was not thrilled w/ the language but she's
fine if all the right people at DOL have signed off, and they have.   DOL
expects to get a draft script over by COB Friday, with hopes of having t
he actuality go out next week--earlier the better.
