We are now locking our conference room door in the evening, after the last
meeting.  I will unlock the door every morning at 8:30 a.m.  If for some
reason, the door is locked in the morning, you will find the key to room
211 in my mailbox on my desk, in room 224.  Please return the key as soon
as possible.

Thanks
