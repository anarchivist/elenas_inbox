         DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE                                            [Auia Df\-Ib rfA1~      J
                                                                                  March 31, 2010 (Senate)

                                   S. 1723 - American Competitiveness Act
                                 (Abraham (R) Michigan and 15 cosponsors)

               , S.I723, "The American Competitiveness Act," is intended to respond to a reported
        skills shortage in the information technology industry by increasing the annual cap on the
        number oftemporary visas for foreign "specialty" workers under the H-IB program. For
        the reasons outlined below, the Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S. 1723.
        If S. 1723 were passed by the Congress and presented to the President, the Secretary of
        Labor would recommend that he veto the bill.

                Regrettably, S.I723 emphasizes providing opportunities for foreign workers rather
        'than providing opportunities for and protecting U.S. workers. The bill's temporary
         increase in the annual number of H-IB visas is too large (up to 115,000) and lasts too long
         (5 years). In addition, the bill does not help ensure that U.S. workers do not lose their jobs to
         temporary foreign workers and that qualified U.S, workers have the opportunity to fill a job
         before a temporary foreign worker is hired. Moreover, rather than strengthening program
         requirements and enforcement to prevent employer abuses of the H-IB program, S.1723
         undermines some of the program's important enforcement provisions.

               Since 1993 the Administration has sought reforms ofthe H-IB program, including
        requiring employers to make bona fide efforts to recruit and retain U.S. workers before
        hiring temporary foreign workers and prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them
        with foreign temporary workers. These reforms, if enacted, would help target H-IB usage
        to industries and employers that are experiencing skill shortages.

                Also, the Administration believes that the first step in increasing the availability of
        skilled workers for industry must be increasing the skills of U.S. workers and helping the
        labor market work better to match employers with U.S. workers. Although S.I723
        includes an authorization for a scholarship fund and a small fund to train dislocated
        workers, the Administration believes that increased training opportunities for U.S. workers
        should be funded through an H-IB application fee paid by employers.

                Substantial additional efforts by industry to increase the skill level of U.S. workers
        and needed improvements in the H-IB program are necessary prerequisites for the
        Administration to support any short-term increase in the number of H-IB visas available
        for temporary foreign workers. The Administration wants to work with the Congress to
        develop a bill that addresses the growing demand for highly skilled workers, while
        effectively protecting and promoting the interests of U.S. workers and enhancing the
        international competitiveness of important U.S. industries.
