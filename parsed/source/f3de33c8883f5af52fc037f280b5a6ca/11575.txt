MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report

        Tobacco: Medicaid Recoupment: Despite efforts by Senators Harkin, Durbin, and
Specter, on Thursday the Senate Appropriations Committee added to the supplemental
appropriations bill the Hutchison bill which lets states keep all tobacco settlement funds
without any commitment to use the federal share to prevent youth smoking, protect tobacco
farmers, promote public health, or assist children. Before the markup, the Chairman of the
Finance Committee, Senator Roth, sent a letter to Senator Stevens saying Appropriations
Committee action on the Hutchison bill would "bypass the jurisdiction of the Finance
Committee" and that the bill "has enormous ramifications for the Medicaid program and
should be thoughtfully considered through the committee process." He noted the amendment
was not paid for and urged the committee, if it was compelled to act, to prevent recoupment
only in 1999 or 2000 to give the Finance Committee time to act. The Hutchison bill now has
40 co-sponsors, including 9 Democrats (many of whom say they would be willing to accept an
alternative along the lines we've proposed). While we continue to urge the Congress to adopt
a measure which ensures the federal share is used to promote public health, assist children and
protect farmers, we recommend we issue a veto threat to underscore our opposition to the
Hutchison measure.

        Tobacco -- New Evidence Confirms Higher Taxes Reduce Smoking: Two new
studies show cigarette sales declined sharply in Alaska and Oregon after the states instituted
higher tobacco taxes. In October 1997, Alaska tripled its tax from $.29 to $1.00 a pack,
raising the retail price of cigarettes by 39 percent to $3.14 a pack. The next year, tobacco
sales declined 17 percent from 1995 and 1996 levels and average monthly tobacco tax
collections increased from $1.5 to $4.3 million per month. Moreover, the state found no
evidence of increased smuggling or crime.
        Oregon raised its tax by $.30 per pack in February 1997, increasing cigarette prices by
16 percent, and devoted 10 percent of the proceeds for tobacco-use prevention programs.
Tobacco sales in 1997 and 1998 fell 11.3 percent compared to 1993-1996 levels. The
analysis, by the Centers for Disease Control and the Oregon Health Division, found that this
comprehensive approach of a price increase plus prevention programs had a much bigger
effect than a price increase alone. Most studies of price increases have found that every 10
percent increase in price will reduce overall smoking by about 4 percent (the effect is higher
for youth -- about 7 percent) -- essentially the effects found in Alaska. According to this
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                  2

model, a 16 percent price increase in Oregon should have resulted in a 6.3 percent decrease in
consumption, not the 11.3 actually achieved. The CDC attributes the higher smoking
reduction rates to the state's $8.5 million a year tobacco use prevention program which funded
community-based tobacco-use prevention coalitions in every county, a statewide public
awareness and education campaign, comprehensive school-based programs, tribal tobacco-use
prevention programs, multicultural outreach and education, a quitters' help line providing
smoking cessation support, and projects evaluating new approaches to prevent or reduce
tobacco use. Nearly all (93 percent) of the program's funds were awarded in grants or
contracts outside state government (£,,&, county health departments, community-based
agencies, tribal governments, private sector agencies implementing public awareness
campaign). These findings bolster the rationale for ensuring that states use at least part of
their settlement on tobacco use prevention.

        Education -- Ed-Flex: The Ed-Flex bill is now being debated on the Senate floor.
The Senate has passed Amendments to strengthen accountability (Kennedy-Dodd) and to
create a priority for high poverty (75%) Title I Schools (Wellstone). We expect the class-size
amendment (Murray-Kennedy) to be offered on Friday. However, the Republican leadership
is seeking a cloture vote at 5 pm on Monday to cut-off debate on Ed-Flex and prevent a vote
on the class size amendment. We have released a statement from you urging the RepUblicans
to allow an up-or- down vote. Secretary Riley and Senate Democrats also held a press
conference at which they calIed for a vote on class size. The major education groups have
launched a campaign to place op-eds in local newspapers and to notify their affiliate offices
about the vote and how much class size funding is at stake in their communities.

        Education -- Supreme Court Ruling on the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA.): The Supreme court voted 7-2 that school districts are required
under IDEA to provide care to a student -- unless that care would need to be administered by a
doctor -- that is necessary for that student to attend school and get a "free and appropriate
public education" guaranteed by the law. The case involved a student in Cedar Rapids, Iowa
whose spinal column had been severed in a motorcycle accident when he was four years old.
The student needs assistance during the day involving such things as tracheotomy tube and
assistance and ventilator assistance.

        The ruling reaffirmed longstanding Education Department interpretation of IDEA, and
the Administration argued on behalf of the student in the case. While the opinion may fuel
public and media concerns about the costs imposed by IDEA, the national costs to local
school districts providing these services may not exorbitant. In 1991, the Office of
Technology Assistance estimated that there are about 680-2000 students who needs ventilator
assistance, and that 1000-6000 students requiring assistance of tracheatomy tubes. The
National School Boards Association estimates that there are about 17,000 students with any
type of need covered by this decision --many much less costly than this student's needs.
Moreover, local school districts do not need to bear the cost of this alone. The Education
Department will continue to offer assistance to help interested states school districts tap
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                    3

existing resources under state set-asides in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
Moreover, many children with these needs may well be eligible for Medicaid. The Education
Department, working with OMB and HHS, will develop a plan for proactive assistance to help
interested states and school districts make appropriate use of existing federal resources to
meet their obligation under the law.

       Health Care -- Release of new regulation to promote the safe and effective use of
over-the-counter drug products: Next Wednesday, the White House will unveil a new
FDA regulation requiring over the counter drug products to use a standardized format
with larger print that makes it easier for consumers to understand product warnings
and comply with dosage guidance. The Vice President will join Secretary Shalala and
FDA Commissioner Henney in announcing that the regulation has been put on display.
This action will be widely heralded by consumer representatives, physician and other
provider groups, and even by product manufacturers. Studies indicate that parents
often have difficulty determining the correct dosage of over-the-counter medications,
and that many of the elderly, who take significantly more over-the counter drugs than
the rest of the population, have difficulty reading the small type on the product labels.
This new regulation represents a critical first step towards preventing the thousands of
unnecessary hospitalizations caused by misuse of over the counter medications each
year.

       Health Care -- Signing of Executive Order on Genetic Discrimination: Next
week, you are tentatively scheduled to sign a new executive order directing Federal
agencies to take all necessary action to guard against employment discrimination in
Federal hiring practices through the inappropriate use of genetic information. The
prohibition against using genetic information to inappropriately deny individuals access
to health insurance coverage for Federal employees and many (but not all) of the insured
population was effectively applied when you signed Kennedy-Kassenbaum into law in
1996. We currently plan to unveil your EO in an event with the Vice President and a
bipartisan group of Members of Congress who are supporting Federal legislation to
apply these protections to all employers and insurers.

        Crime -- Directive on Firearms Enforcement: We are preparing a directive for you
to sign that will ask Secretary Rubin and Attorney General Reno to work with the U.S.
Attorneys and ATF Special Agents in Charge to develop a national strategy to strengthen the
enforcement and prosecution of federal firearms laws. As you know, the NRA has repeatedly
caIled for the widespread replication of Project Exile in Richmond, VA, where the U.S.
Attorney generaIly prosecutes all firearms offenses in federal court. Your proposed directive
will be bro~der in scope. It will call for: the timely prosecution of gun criminals at the
federal and state level; increased efforts to trace crime guns, identify illegal gun markets, and
determine gun "hot spots"; coordinated law enforcement efforts to ensure that gun dealers
comply with all applicable city, state and federal laws; and more. This directive could be
released in conjunction with a new Justice Department report, Promising Strategies to Reduce
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                   4

Gun Violence, which details more than 50 examples of local strategies and partnerships that
are reducing gun violence across the country. These include: comprehensive violence
reduction programs that focus on guns; gun deterring illegal gun possession through consent
searches and the aggressive seizure of firearms; targeted enforcement in gun "hot spots";
increased surveillance of probationers; school-based prevention programs; focused and
vertical prosecution strategies; and special youth gun courts.
        Crime -- Upcoming AnnouncementslHearings: Next Thursday, Deputy Attorney
General Holder plans to use his morning press availability to highlight the community
prosecutors portion of your proposed 21 st Century crime bill. As you know, your FY 2000
budget and proposed crime bill will include $1 billion over the next 5 years to hire and train
community prosecutors. As the former U.S. Attorney for DC, Holder helped to launch one of
the first successful community prosecution p~ograms, and he is personally committed to
building public and congressional support for this initiative. On a related note, in testimony
before the House Committee on Government Reform this past Wednesday, Mayor Guiliani of
New York expressed support for community prosecution programs.

        Welfare Reform -- Supplemental Proposes Cutting TANF Block Grant: The
Senate Appropriations committee has proposed paying for emergency supplemental spending
in part by cutting $350 million in TANF block grant funding in FY 1999. While the bill
would restore the cut in later years, we believe this provision establishes a dangerous
precedent of raiding T ANF to pay for other measures and we should vigorously oppose it.
Cuts in TANF will undermine states' ability to reserve funds for a rainy day and assist families
during an economic downturn. Moreover, cuts in T ANF may prevent states from .investing in
helping more families move from welfare to work, just as work requirements increase and
those remaining on the rolls face greater challenges to employment. Finally cuts in TANF
may interfere with innovative efforts to help those former recipients who have joined the
workforce succeed in the workplace and advance in their careers. The governors are strongly
opposing these cuts, saying they break the commitment made by the Congressional leadership
in 1996 to a guaranteed five years of full block grant funding.

       State data compiled by HHS (but not yet released) show that in FY 1998 states spent
or obligated 84% of the $16.5 billion T ANF block grant, leaving $2.7 billion or 16%
unobligated. There is considerable state variation -- 19 states have obligated all of their FY
98 funds, but 12 states account for three-quarters of the unobligated balances. We will
provide you with more complete report on these trends in a separate memo.

        Immigrant Benefits -- Declining Participation: The Urban Institute will issue a
report on Monday showing evidence of a "chilling effect" that has resulted in fewer immigrant
families, compared to citizen families, accessing an array of public benefits. The study found
receipt of cash benefits (AFDC/TANF, SSI, and state-funded general assistance) by
noncitizens declined by 35 percent from 1994 to 1997 while use by citizens declined 15
percent. Use of Medicaid and Food Stamps declined 22 and 30 percent respectively among
noncitizens, but only 7 and 21 percent among citizens.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                     5


        The report concludes that these effects are due primarily to the "chilling effect" of the
welfare reform debate, since most legal immigrants were actually still eligible for benefits in
1997. (While new immigrants arriving after August 1996 were ineligible, the vast majority
oflegal immigrants in the U.S. in 1997 had arrived prior to that date and due to a one year
delay in implementation were eligible for Food Stamps for most of the year and for SS1 all
year (since SS1 benefits were restored in August 1997). Moreover, all but one or two states
opted to provide TANF and Medicaid to legal immigrants who arrived before August 1996.)
Despite the fact that most legal immigrants were eligible for most benefits in 1997, the
publicity surrounding the debate over welfare and immigration reform may have led many
immigrants to think they were ineligible or that accepting benefits would affect their
immigration status. As you know we have been working closely with the Department of
Justice and HHS on these issues, and we expect the INS will issue guidance in the near future
to provide clarity on what type of benefits an immigrant can accept without being labeled a
"public charge." Clearer guidance on public charge policies, along with our proposals to
restore additional health, nutrition, and disability benefits to vulnerable legal immigrants, will
allow us to begin sending clearer messages to immigrant families regarding their eligibility for
benefits.

Note to Bruce and Elena: You asked how it was true that most legal immigrants were still
eligible for benefits in 1997. Here's how:

Immigrants who arrived before 8/22/96 -- the vast majority of immigrants in U.S. in
1997

SS1 and Food Stamps: The welfare law gave the agencies a year to conduct redeterminations
for SS1 and Food Stamps for immigrants in the U.S. as of August 22, 1996. SSA and USDA
conducted the redeterminations, but delayed notifying immigrants of their ineligibility for as
long as possible. SS1 benefits were restored August 5, 1997. Food Stamps were not, but
immigrants were eligible for most of 1997.

Medicaid and TANF: the law gave states the option of providing TANF and Medicaid to
immigrants who arrived pre 8/22/96. (Those receiving SS1 as noted above automatically got
Medicaid.) Every state but Alabama provided TANF; every state but Louisiana and
Wyoming provided Medicaid.

Immigrants who arrived after 8/22/96 -- a small percentage of immigrants

In 1997, immigrants who arrived after 8/22/96 were ineligible for SS1, Medicaid (except
emergency), TANF, and Food Stamps.

        Discrimination -- Urban Institute Report: On March 2, 1999, the Urban
Institute issued a report, A National Report Card on Discrimination in America: The Role'
                                                                               He~,!)ump Convarsion
                                                                                                    6

of Testing that calls for a national report card on discrimination in America. They
contend that such a report card would promote greater understanding of the prevalence
of discrimination, provide strategic guidance to civil rights enforcement agencies, and
develop insight on the changing pattern and impact of discrimination. The report also
shows that a research method called paired testing -- the practice of sending individuals
similar in all relevant characteristics except racial or ethnic backgrounds -- can be used
to audit critical areas of discrimination. Currently, paired testing is used primarily by
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other agencies such as
Departments of Justice and Labor. The EEOC conducted a pilot project on the use of
paired testing in the context of employment discrimination. However, Congress .
objected to the EEOC pilot project and EEOC agreed not to do any further testing in
return for an increased funding. In the FY 2000 budget, the President's budget
includes $10 million for measuring discrimination including $7.5 million to expand the
HUD program. If the results of the EEOC pilot program show promise, we may
consider expanding the paired testing method to employment discrimination but it may
raise the ire of Congress.

       Children and Families -- Child Care. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on
Human Resources will hold a hearing on child care on March 16, which is significant because
the last Congress refused to hold even a single hearing on the issue. The Administration will
lead off the hearing testimony. Prior to the hearing, the Subcommittee's ranking Democrat,
Rep. Ben Cardin (D-MD), will introduce a child care bill largely based on the
Administration's proposals. In addition, Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-CA) will re-introduce last
year's House Democratic consensus child care bill and will reach out to the Democratic
caucus for extensive Democratic co-sponsorship. Finally, we understand that Rep. Nancy
Johnson (R-CT), Chair of the Subcommittee, may re-introduce the tax provisions of her child
care bill from last year, which included the expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Tax
Credit and a new credit for stay-at-home parents.

         Livability -- Better America Bonds: DPC and Treasury staff met last week with
staff from Ways and Means and Representatives Doggett and Matsui. Both Congressman are
interested in introducing on behalf of the Administration, the Better America Bonds proposal.
 We will be working with their offices and Treasury over the next three weeks to draft the
legislation.
