TEXT:
On the way back we had an idea that we'd be curious to get your reaction
to.   We could create a new authority for states to transfer some portion
of their TANF block grant to a new fathers block grant. This grant could
still require that fathers play by the rules in terms of work and
supporting their children.   The transfer could either be within or in
addition to the 30% they can now transfer to SSBG and child care. Since
CBO would probably score this as additional spending above what states
would otherwise draw down in 2000 it wouldn't be totally free.   But, it
could help signal that states can and should use some the TANF funds for
the broader family formation/values purposes of PRWORA (while states can
theoretically define fathers as part of an eligible family under TANF and
provide services to them this way, this is easier said than done and all
the TANF rules still apply). It would also give states a way to spend more
of their TANF funds, thereby making them less vulnerable to being cut for
other purposes.
