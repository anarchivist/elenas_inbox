Page me if you need me.

1) Tomorrow morning's meeting is one of the interagency policy group to
discuss a 10 page summary of the proposed draft regulations.  I have
reviewed the document; it is fine and reiterates the program's strong
local role.  I have given a copy to Emily.

2) If the policy group approves this 10 pager, then DOL will use it to
consult with outside groups.

3) By next Thursday, after consultation with outside groups, DOL will
officially submit its draft reg to OMB and us for review. They have given
the policy committee their·draft to date.

I gave Rob Weiner of counsel's office materials to review today in case we
will need him during the regulatory process to help us argue for
PIC-focussed regs.  So far things look good.
