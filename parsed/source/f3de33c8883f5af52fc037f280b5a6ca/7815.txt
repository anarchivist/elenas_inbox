TEXT:
Just a heads up that Melissa Skolfied will probably be contacting one of
you to request that the Secretary have speaking role in the East Room
program, especially to announce caseloads.  That is not our current plan.
We had thought she and Herman might lead off discussion with CEOs in
Roosevelt Room before POTUS arrrives.
