TEXT:
Here are a few things I'd like your feedback on:

1. Invitees: We have room for lots of guests. We're currently planning
to have about half minority health folks and about half general
tobacco/public types.  Should we invite Koop and Kessler? Also, fyi, by
the time I got back to DuVal, he's already invited AGs -- not sure if any
are coming.

2. Kids: We plan to have kids walk out with the President, and sit on
stage and/or in cutaway. The suggestion is half white, and half minority
(of all four types) -- does that sound right?

3. Speeches: planned program is VP, Sha1ala, Satcher, POTUS. Thus, we
need to coordinate messages.  How about --
        VP: Highlight Administration's track record and/or individual heroes in
audience that have worked to reduce minority tobacco use
        Shalala: Key role of Surgeon General's reports on tobacco, starting with
1964 report
        Satcher: Why tobacco is a public health problem
        POTUS: Highlight stats showing minority youth smoking on the rise, push
for comprehensive legislation

4. Leak: Shall we leak to the Today show and get Satcher on?   Not sure
there's much to leak (maybe the chart -- see below)

5. Chart: I've got HHS working on a chart we could use, showing the
increase in minority youth smoking by group -- Ann Lewis had the idea of
having a colorful, camera-friendly chart.

6. Brief: Do you, Satcher and Shalala want to meet with the Press
afterwards?
