                                PRESIDENT CLINTON:
                   EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
                                   **2/9 DRAFT**

    Today, at the University of Maryland, College Park, President Clinton called on Congress to
    expand the yearly participation level in AmeriCorps to 100,000 members by 2002. He also
    kicked-off AmeriCorps' largest national recruitment campaign to challenge young people to
    provide service to their communities.

    AMERICORPS EXPANSION. When he came into office in 1993, President Clinton
    outlined a vision for a national service program that linked responsiblity to opportunity by
    allowing young people to serve our nation while earning funds for a college education. The
    result of that vision is AmeriCorps, which is bringing people of different racial, ethnic and
    economic backgrounds together to solve community problems and improve the lives of
    Americans. AmeriCorps members give children the tools they need to succeed, including
    teaching them how to read, organizing quality after-school programs, mentoring students
    and they also strengthen communities by making schools and streets safer, building
    affordable housing, and mobilizing community volunteers.

    The President seeks to build on this success by creating more opportunities for Americans
    to serve through AmeriCorps. President Clinton's budget proposes to expand
    AmeriCorps to nearly 70,000 members by the year 2000, with the goal of reaching 100,000
    members serving each year by 2002. This expansion will also allow high school juniors and
    seniors to serve in AmeriCorps during the summers in exchange for college education
    awards. The FY 2000 budget request includes $585 million for AmeriCorps, an increase of
    $113 million over last year.

    A CALL TO SERVICE CAMPAIGN. President Clinton announced the launch of the
    AmeriCorps Call To Service campaign, the largest-ever national recruitment drive for
    AmeriCorps. The President challenged all Americans, especially young people, to get
    involved in service. The Call to Service campaign will provide young people with
    information on how they can serve in AmeriCorps to help strengthen local communities.
    The campaign includes a new television public service announcement produced by MTV,
    print advertisements, campus visits and other local recruitment efforts.

    A PROVEN RECORD OF SUCCESS. In just four years, over 100,000 young people have
    joined AmeriCorps to serve more than 4,000 communities. AmeriCorps provides needed
    human resources to schools churches, community groups and nonprofits, including Habitat
    for Humanity, Big Brother/Big Sister and the American Red Cross. A recent evaluation
    confirms that AmeriCorps strengthens communities in many ways: building leadership,
    citizenship, and other important skills; and making community organizations more effective.
    Since 1994, AmeriCorps members have served more than 32 million people, mobilized nearly 2
    million volunteers, taught, tutored or mentored more than 2 million children, organized
    after-school programs for more than a half million at-risk youth, helped more than 200,000 senior
    citizens live independently and built or rehabilitated more than 25,000 homes. After a year of
    full-time service, AmeriCorps members receive education awards to help finance college or pay
                      Hex-Dump Conversion
back student loans.
