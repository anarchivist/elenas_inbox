TEXT:
Folks--We have a request from labor for a small senior level meeting early
this week to discuss worker protections and welfare reform, including the
governors' current efforts.  They seem to be realistic in their analysis
that this issue is not over.  I talked to John P and John H briefly about
this late last week.  John H said.Janet should be involved inasmuch as
she's been in the loop--do we need intergov to hear their views or provide
intelligence on the governors? Let's try for Tues or Weds--let me know
your thoughts and Marjorie will coordinate setting up a meeting.  Thanks.
