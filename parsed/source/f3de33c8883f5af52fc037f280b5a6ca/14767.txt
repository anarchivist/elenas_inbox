TEXT:
Here is a proposed agenda for our meeting today at 4:30 on the service
summit. We should give this some thought, so we don't alarm people too
much or too little. What do you think?

1. Problems with structure/communication we are having and possible
solutions
        -Powell meeting
        -comments on task force names
        -key person at Corp?
        -more emphasis on service/Americorps

2.   Our involvement in summit
         -President
         -other principals
         -cabinet

3.   Pre-summit event possibilities
          -HS service scholarships
          -Federal commitment

Invited are Sylvia, Baer, Kamarck, Matsui, Hale, Brophy, McHugh, Hawley,
and counsel's office.
