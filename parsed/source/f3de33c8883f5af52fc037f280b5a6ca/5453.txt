TEXT:
The memo Kalil is doing on long distance learning for POTUS will be for a
small $50 million pilot program.   I've continued to push that the goal of
the program be focused on students: making information on the programs
available, making financial aid programs cover these kind of classes,
accrediting programs that deserve it so the degrees have meaning. Most of
the actual money is still for software type development but the memo will
reflect the notion that the goal is to make it easier for students/workers
to usefully take advantage of this new technology.   The financial aid
commitment so far seems pretty symbolic.   In meetings yesterday all
Education was willing to do was expand the Pell grant so ·that computers
are counted ,as part of students' need calculation. We asked them to go
back and look at other things, including Life long learning.
