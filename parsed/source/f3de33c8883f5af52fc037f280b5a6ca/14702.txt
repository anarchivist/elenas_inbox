     GBackground checks estimated to have stopped 186,000 illegal gun
         WASHINGTON (AP)    Police background checks since 1994 have
     blocked more than 186,000 illegal over-the-counter gun sales    72
     percent by would-be buyers who were convicted or indicted for a
     felony, the Justice Department estimated Tuesday.
         The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated that 6,600
     applications to buy handguns or long guns are rejected each month
     not only in the 32 states covered by the federal Brady Act but also
     in those states that have their own similar laws authorizing
     background checks of gun-buyers.
         The figures cover the 28 months from Feb. 28, 1994, when the
     Brady Act took effect, through last June.
         By far the largest reason for blocking gun sales was the
     discovery that the buyer had been convicted or indicted for a .
     felony, which occurred in 72 percent of the cases.
         Fugitives accounted for 6 percent of the rejections; those
     barred by some state law provision, 4 percent; those under court
     restraining orders, 2 percent; mental patients, 1 percent. Some 15
     percent were rejected for other reasons, including that they were
     drug addicts, juveniles, illegal aliens or violators of local
     ordinances.
         The overall rate of applicants rejected was 2.6 percent in a
     sampling of handgun applications during the first six months of
     1996. Out of 1.3 million handgun applications during that period,
     34,000 were rejected.
         --Today's Justice Department study provides dramatic new
     evidence of the importance of the Brady law's background checks in
     stopping criminals from obtaining a firearm, " said Sarah Brady,
     chair of Handgun Control Inc. The law was named after her husband,
     James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was
     seriously wounded by a gunman who also shot President Ronald
     Reagan.
         --The numbers released today probably understate the real impact
     and importance of background checks,"   she said. --It's not just
     the criminals who walk into a gun store and are stopped from

.'   .'
     purchasing a gun; it's all those criminals who are deterred from
     even walking into a gun store in the first place. ' ,
         The Brady Act requires that gun dealers wait five days before
     selling a handgun and ask local police to do a background check on
     the buyer during that time. Another federal law prohibits the sale
     of any firearm to anyone convicted or indicted for a felony,
     fugitives, illegal drug users, illegal aliens, mental patients,
     dishonorably discharged soldiers, and those convicted of domestic
     violence or under court restraining order for stalking or harassing
     an intimate partner.
         The report noted that not all states check for mental
     disability, restraining orders or drug abuse. As of last June, 14
     states reported presale investigations included checking
     outstanding restraining orders; 11 states looked into mental health
     records.
         The bureau surveyed 600 law enforcement agencies, of which 176
     in 44 states responded. The national estimates were derived by
     using standard statistical techniques to account for the
     non-responding states.
         The Brady law provides that the waiting period will be
     eliminated when a national computerized instant criminal background
     check system administered by the FBI is established by November
     1998.
         President Clinton has proposed expanding the Brady law to ban
     handgun sales to adults who had been convicted of felonies as
     juveniles.
