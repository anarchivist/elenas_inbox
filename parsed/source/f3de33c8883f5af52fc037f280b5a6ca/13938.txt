TEXT:

        I've already left voice mails for most of you (many seem to be on
vacation, a place I will be beginning tomorrow), but I wanted to follow up with
an e-mail to pass on some comments from Sally. She'd like it if folks would
fax to her on the cape their draft boilerplate language (Elena - Federalism;
Jeremy - Family; Linda and Tom - Takings). She's anxious to review the drafts
so we can begin the phone calls to the agencies as soon as possible. I will be
back the week of the 26th and plan to pull us all together quickly to coordinate
the language and the calls.                                       .
        Sally's fax number is (508)1 P6/(b)(6) 'l Thanks for all your help.  Coo            \J.
