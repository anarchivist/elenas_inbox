         Bruce and Elena--

         How hard do you think we ought to push for an education event over fast
         track on this one? We should be getting a draft of ED's community college
         report tonight or first thing in the morning.

         Thanks.

         I am assuming you guys still want to do a Hope Scholarship/community
         college event in Houston.  Please come prepared to defend as the fast
         track crowd will be aruging a fast track event.   Education has
         recommended that we go to North Harris College in North Harris Montgomery
         County.    I will send you info on the school.
