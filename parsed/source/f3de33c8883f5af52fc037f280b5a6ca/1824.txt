          CELEBRATING AND PROMOTING EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING
                          DRAFT -- April 15, 1997

Today the President will focus on a key element of his Call to Action for American Education:
making sure there's a talented and dedicated teacher in every classroom. The President will host
the new national Teacher of the Year and the 50 state teachers of the year in a White House event
that celebrates excellence in teaching, and highlights the need for states and school districts to do
more to nurture outstanding teaching among both new and experienced teachers.

Supporting and Rewarding Excellence Among Experienced Teachers. The new National
Teacher of the Year, Cincinnati English teacher Sharon Draper of Cincinnati, is the first Teacher
of the Year to be nationally board-certified as a master teacher. Today the President will stress
the importance of his proposal to help identify and recognize 100,000 more experienced teachers
who meet high standards in academic content and teaching skill -- at least one for every school in
the U.S. The President's five-year balanced budget plan includes$1 00 million to assist the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) to finish developing content area
standards and provide access to the certification process for 100,000 teachers.

The President will also renew his challenge to states and school districts to support teachers who
undertake the rigorous national board certification process and reward financially experienced
teachers who attain this distinction. Already eight states help teachers pay NBPTS certification
fees, while six states provide salary supplements to Board certified instructors.

Doing More to Help Two Million New Teachers Get Off to a Good Start. Over the next
decade our nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. Yet, according to the recent report of
the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, up to one-third of new U.S.
teachers leave the profession within three years. One reason is our typical "sink or swim"
attitude toward the critical early stages of a teacher's career. Today the President will release a
new eleven-nation study of practices in the area of supporting new teachers. The study, From
Students of Teaching to Teachers of Students: Teacher Induction Around the Pacific Rim
features in-depth case studies of promising practices in Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. For
example, in new Zealand and Japan, new teachers may be assigned to less difficult classes, and
given lighter teaching loads so they have time to work with mentor teachers to hone their skills.
The President will call on states and school districts to review and improve their strategies for
helping new teachers make a successful transition into the classroom.

Highlighting Resources to Improve Teaching at all Career Stages. Secretary Riley will
present to President Clinton a guide, prepared at the direction of the President, that summarizes
key federal resources available to school districts and schools that can be used to promote
excellence and accountability in teaching. The report provides ideas and examples of how
federal resources can be used to support local strategies for improving teaching, and summarizes
major federal programs and technical assistance providers in the area of teaching. The President
will encourage states, districts and schools to use these resources creatively to insure that every
child has dedicated teachers who know their subject matter, are effectively trained, and know
how to teach to high standards and make learning come alive for students.
