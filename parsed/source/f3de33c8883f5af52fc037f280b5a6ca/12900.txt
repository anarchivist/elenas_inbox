TEXT:
As you know, we have developing an INS Detention proposal that has budget,
administrative and legislative component to address the overcrowding
issue.

OMB plans to send this package up today along with other budget
amendments{ie - census).  This package needs to be sent today b/c Senate
Subcommittee on Commerce Justice plans to mark up on Wednesday and they
want this proposal to be considered as part of that mark up.

I have reviewed the various components and it appears that INS has
developed a good approach to address overcrowding issue.   It's a $230
million proposal for detention services, administrative proposalt to
improve the mangement of the detention centers, and some legislative
fixes.

However, the offsets for this package may be the most controversial area
b/c the offset includes reinstatement 245{i), and taking funds from the
border patrol hiring funds since INS is unable to hire the 1000 border
patrol authorized. Also, Jose raised some concerns with taking money from
the victim fund.  According to OMB, they do not have any other
alternatives and they believe that the Hill will be critical if offsets
are not proposed.

I will send to you by fax more detailed information (fact sheet and qs and
as) ·on the entire package later today.  I have a draft but it requires
some changes.

please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns about
this approach.  Thanks.
