 FYI -- we're giving another important leak to USA Today for Monday -- so
 this might get crosswise of your consumer bill of rights deal.

 If we want to save the report, we need to decide that quickly, because ED
 has USA Today scheduled to come in first thing tomorrow morning to leak
 it, and Tamara Henry knows generally what the report is about at this
 point.   They think we could pull this back but we would owe her one at
 that point.

 If we do save it, it might make sense to fill the "Education Week" hole
 by having Riley come over Monday and do the riff on GOP's against reading
 and tests that we had been planning for the VP -- do it at the top of the
 McCurry briefing when he would have discussed the report. One possible
 problem with that is Riley currently has a request in for a meeting with
 Goodling, so it might be a little odd to jump on him just at the time when
 he was asking for a meeting (this is also a problem with the letter idea
 we discussed earlier) -- Riley's legislative shop is skittish about this.

A couple other possibilities for the message event (I'm checking with ED
for other reports/grant announcements coming up) :

 -- save the teaching grant that we plan to release on Friday (a little odd
 since lead institution is U MD, plus this is a good fit with National
 Board event)

 -- save Obey endorsement/play up New American schools (but not clear this
 is a good fit with school to be visited because targeted on
 low-income/failing schools).



 -- perhaps release math action strategy -- play up as response to TIMSS
 scores and findings of coursetaking study

 It's too bad about school construction, because evidently Florida
 Republicans have passed legislation that redefines portable buildings as
 permanent, not temporary -- that's their "solution" to the school
 construction problem.

 As most of you know, the President is returning to Jupiter, Florida on
 October 31 to visit the Elementary School he was supposed to go to when he
 broke his knee. We need to determine what message event we will do at the
 school. Originally we were going to do school construction. After our
 meeting yesterday with Erskine, it seems unlikely that we are going to be
 ready to endorse any kind of school construction proposal by 10/31 -- so I
 guess we need another message. Everyone should be aware, however, that
 the school is overcrowded with many students attending classes in
 trailers, so school construction is likely to be raised as an issue
 whether we like it or not.



 NEC -- is it clear that school construction is not an option?

 DPC/NEC -- if so, do you have other suggestions?

 Thanks.
