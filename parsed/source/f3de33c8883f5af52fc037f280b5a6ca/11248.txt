TEXT:
I have been hearing many different things about the press paper for
tomorrow's radio address, and I wanted to clarify with you what we want to
produce. As I understand it, we want to simultaneouly release the
state-by-state numbers for class size and school construction (if
available) with the POTUS address, although he will not be mentioning this
in his remarks. Chuck Marr just told me that Jake Siewert has concerns
about doing the school construction numbers because he believes the
governors don't like our proposal. What do you think about this?

In terms of paper, do we want to do:
1. a regular one-pager including about accountability package, and small
paragraph about simultaneous release of numbers.
2.  state-by-state #s for class size -- do we want number of teachers or
number of dollars, or both?
3. state-by-state #s for school construction -- if available -- unless
you and Bruce agree with Jake's line of though.
4. Tanya mentioned to me that you wanted to try to do a one-pager that
would plug in the #s for each state.

Is there anything else?
