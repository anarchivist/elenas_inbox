TEXT:
        We won't let this drop (I know Sally is serious about getting you
the kind of heads-up info you need).  You will also note that we've added
you to the circulation list for our "heads-up" memos to Erskine -- we have
a fairly low "controversy" threshold for those.  If you'd like even
earlier notice, I can send you an e-mail as soon as we identify an issue
worthy of a memo even before we've finished drafting it.  Let me know.
