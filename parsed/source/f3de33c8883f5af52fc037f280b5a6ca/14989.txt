I have an appointment at 1:00 on how to use Lotus Organizer and some other
soft ware in the training room in the OEOB.   I will be back around 2 or
2:30.

Your afternoon seems pretty free especially 'if you will not be going to
Rahm's meeting, but Michelle did e-mail me to tell you.

Also Chris Cerf called back 429-3355.
