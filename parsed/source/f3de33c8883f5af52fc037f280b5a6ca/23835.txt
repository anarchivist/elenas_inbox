TEXT:
Folks--Congressman Underwood is chair of the Asian Pacific Congressional
Caucus--they really want some public ceremony for Asian Heritage month--I
explained the schedule so he wants the exec order done in a public way.   I
told we were thinking of ideas--I recall that Mary Beth said something
about doing it in conjunction with the first outreach mtg--is that where
we're heading? Should we be doing a photo op with folks separately from
the outreach mtg???
