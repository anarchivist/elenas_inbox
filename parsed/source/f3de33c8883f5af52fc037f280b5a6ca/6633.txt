MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan
               Chris Jennings

SUBJECT:       Needle Exchange


        This memorandum addresses Administration options on needle exchange, with the
congressional moratorium as needle exchange funding about to expire, the AIDS community will
soon put increased pressure on the Administration to release federal funds for needle exchange
programs. Members of your Advisory Council on AIDS are considering the possibility of using
their meeting next week to take some dramatic action on the issue, such as calling on Secretary
Shalala to resign unless she makes the certification necessary to allow federal funding. We,
therefore, think that you should give immediate attention to this issue.

Background

          For some years, Labor-HHS appropriations bill have allowed the use of federal funds for
. needle exchange programs but only if the Secretary certifies that such programs (1) decrease HIV
  transmission or (2) do not increase drug use. In the last appropriations bill, Congress prohibited
 the Secretary from making this certification until March 31, 1998. On that date, the Secretary
  once again will be able to release federal funds for needle exchange upon making the appropriate
  findings.

       (A separate and even more stringent statutory test governs the use of SAMHSA funds for
needle exchange programs. These funds may not be used unless the Surgeon General finds that
needle exchange programs (1) decrease HIV transmission and (2) also decrease drug use.
Because no one believes that the available evidence can support the latter finding, the release of
SAMHSA funds is not now at issue.)

        The Secretary already has found that needle exchange programs decrease HIV
transmission; until now, however, she has not made a formal finding that these programs do not
increase drug use. HHS scientists have been studying the current data carefully, and probably
will recommend soon that the Secretary make this finding. Assuming they do so, the Secretary
would like to issue the formal certification necessary to release federal funds. The ONDCP
Director adamantly opposes this action, primarily on the ground that it "would weaken the
anti-drug message." (See separate memo from General McCaffrey.)
                                                                     Automated Records :tIfanugement System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

             The AIDS community, public health community, and elite validators strongly support
    releasing federal funds for needle exchange programs. They believe that current scientific
    evidence supports this action, and that only political considerations stand in its way. The law
    enforcement community -- and probably a majority of the public -- would oppose the action
    strongly. They believe that it would       -- and whatever the scientists say, ultimately increase --
    illegal drug use.

    Options

    There are currently four options on needle exchange.

           1. Maintain the status quo. Under this option, we would continue to say that the
    evidence is insufficient to find that needle exchange programs do not increase drug use. This
    option would provoke the wrath of the AIDS community and the criticism of elite validators. It
    would force us to defend against a change of moral cowardice. The option, however, would
    allow us to avoid confrontation with Congress over needle exchange policy -- a          That we
    almost certainly would lose and that could        great political cost.

             2. Make the necessary findings, but decline to release funds. Under this option, either
    HHS scientists or the Secretary herself would make the            Findings,  The Administration
    nonetheless would decline to release federal funds to needle exchange programs. We would
    argue that such a change of policy requires the building of public consensus within the political
    arena -- that this decision is not, in the end, solely scientific. Again, many in the AIDS and
    public health communities will charge the Administration with a kind of moral bankruptcy,
    arguing that if we know needle exchange saves lives (as the findings state), then we have no
    justification for declining to support these programs. In addition, the option may encourage
    Congress to legislate in this area -- for example, by placing a flat prohibition on needle exchange
    funding on an appropriations bill or the ONDCP reauthorization. This option at least would
    give a scientific      To needle exchange programs (thus encouraging local communities to fund
    such programs on their own), and the AIDS community appears to prefer this compromise to any
    other.

            3. Release federal funds for needle exchange, but only if local law enforcement
    authorities approve the program. Under this option, HHS would make the requisite findings, but
    rele~se funds only to local communities where law enforcement officials sign on to the needle
    exchange program. This added condition would         To insulate the Administration from the
    charge that its policy will undermine law enforcement. Accordingly, the condition also might
    stave off a confrontation with Congress on the needle exchange issue. The AIDS community,
    however, would oppose the condition strenuously, believing that few law enforcement officials
    would sign on to needle exchange programs and that the Administration's action would signal to
    local communities that these programs raise a serious law enforcement issue.

           4. Release federal funds for needle exchange programs, as long as they are combined
                                                                                                            ·
    with drug treatments. Under this option, the Administration would release funds to all
    communities in which needle exchange programs are linked.to drug treatment. The AIDS and
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

public health communities would support this approach strongly, and the link to treatment would
give us some answer to the charge that funding needle exchange condones illegal drug use. But
this option would touch off a battle with Congress, which would put many Democratic members
in a difficult position and almost certainly would result in reversal of the policy.

        HHS and the AIDS office strongly favor the fourth option; ONDCP favors the first. . As
between the compromise approaches, the AIDS office believes that the AIDS community will
more readily accept the second option (findings without funding) than the third (law enforcement
sign-off). For similar reasons, HHS favors the second approach to the third. ONDCP has
indicated no preference among the compromise approach; General McCaffrey adamantly insists
that he needs to engage in a further review of the scientific evidence relating to needle exchange,
and that nothing should be done until he completes that process.

        DPC believes that both the first and fourth options are untenable. The fourth will subject
us to relentless criticism on law enforcement grounds and lead to the enactment of harmful
legislation (perhaps even prohibiting locally-funded needle exchange). The first.would subject
us to equally relentless criticism on public health grounds and could chill the appropriate use
even of locally-funded needle exchange programs. As between the compromise approaches, we
have a slight policy preference for the law enforcement officials sign-off, which would lead to
some federal financing of needle exchange, while acknowledging the legitimate interest of
law-enforcement officials -- and the potential value of their involvement -- in needle exchange
programs. But we believe that the findings-without-funding approach may have greater appeal
to people on both sides of the issue and thus offer a more stable base for continued dialogue and
compromIse. We therefore recommend option two.

Option 1:       Maintain the status quo

Option 2:       Make findings, but release no funds

Option 3:       Release funds with law enforcement sign-off

Option 4:       Release funds, assuming drug treatment programs

Let's discuss
