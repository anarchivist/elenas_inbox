TEXT:
Chris Georges is asking the following question.  Please review the
suggested response and let me know if you have any suggestions.  Thanks.

Q:      WonO,t raising the minimum wage hurt welfare-to-work efforts in
the states?

A:      No.  An increase in the minimum wage will support the goals of welfare
reform by ensuring that wages keep up with the cost of living and people
leaving welfare for work can support ~heir families and break the cycle ·of
dependency.

This increase will not make it substantially more difficult for states to
meet the welfare lawO,s work participation rates (30 percent in FY 1998,
rising to 40 percent in 2000 and 50 percent by 2002). While states that
put welfare recipients in workfare programs will of course have to pay
them ·the new minimum wage.  Such workfare programs are only a small part
of most state sO, welfare-to-work efforts. These efforts focus primarily
on getting welfare recipients private sector jobs, and can also include
work-related activities like job search, vocational education, and high
school (for teenagers) .

For stat"es that do chose to create workfare programs, we have helped them
pay the minimum wage by allowing them to count not only cash assistance,
but also food stamps, toward the wage.   The dramatic drop in welfare
case loads further ensures that states will have adequate funding to pay
workfare participants the minimum wage, because under the welfare law,
states receive fixed block grants regardless of welfare caseloads.    For
example, for a family of three on workfare, only five states might have to
make slight adjustments to meet the higher minimum wage when it takes
effect.
