     STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

     I am disappointed that so few states are devoting tobacco settlement funds
     to reducing youth smoking, as shown by the new report from the Campaign
     for Tobacco Free Kids and the American Heart Association. This new report
     underscores why I strongly oppose any legislation waiving the federal
     governmentO,s claim to tobacco settlement funds without a commitment from
     the states to fund youth tobacco prevention efforts.   In the absence of
     such a commitment, states wonO,t have to spend a single penny of the $246
     billion tobacco settlement to reduce youth smoking.  We must act now:
     every day, 3,000 children become regular smokers and 1,000 will have their
     lives cut short as result.
