Subject:         ONDCP Concerns About Needle Exchange

ONDCP has objected to the proposed language in the FY99 budget relating to
needle exchange (see below). The language proposed by OMB is thoroughly
consistent with current Administration policy and public health science.
ONDCP's assertion that OMB is proposing to "loosen" the criteria is
factually incorrect and misleading; in reality, the criteria have remained
the same since originally offered on the floor by Senator Hatch (1990).
Making the change proposed by ONDCP would constitute a major shift in Admi
nistration policy and severely compromise the current authority of the
Secretary.

Any change in Administration policy should be resolved by principals.

Subject:         needle exchange

per discussion with General McCaffrey this am-- omb's proposed compromise
language on needle exhcange is unacceptable.    Specifically we object to
changes that loosen the criteria for the use of federal funds--i.e. omb's
language refers to "not encouraging" drrug use and ONDCP would retain
"reducing the use of illegal drugs."    We will have a letter to you
shortly, and if need be, are prepared to take this to a principal's level
discussion for resolution   Janet Crist
