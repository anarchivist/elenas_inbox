TEXT:
Here is a   more substantive version of the GED item.

GED.  In response to your inquiry on this matter, we have learned that the
American Council on Education is responsible for the developing and
administering the GED. As you know, the credibility of the GED has eroded
considerably in recent years because its standards have remained fixed
(and relatively low) while secondary school, institutions of higher
education and employers have focused intensely on raising standards. ACE
is in the process of upgrading the GED to keep up with state efforts to
raise standards, and plans to unveil a new test in 2001. DPC and the
Education Department will work to determine how we can best help adult
education programs, community colleges and school" systems prepare people
for the strengthened GED.
