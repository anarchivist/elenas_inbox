TEXT:
NACARA reg - I have reviewed the reg and I believe that it will be well
received but some groups may still argue that the regulation does not go
far enough to provide parity.
The INS Commissioner will announce -the reg the afternoon of 5/20 with
briefings in the morning - Hill,  groups, and press.

Parity Legislation - DOJ has accepted the State Dept. 's rationale and
will draft legislation that is broad (cover all Central Americans,
Haitians and Eastern Europeans in the US as of 1995). Given the shorten
time frame, we (Scott, Caroline and I) do not think it is necessary to
send up legislation on the same day as the reg is announced but shortly
thereafter.   However, if asked about the legislation we will indicate
that the President will submit legislation to address the inequities that
remain soon.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.
