           Attached is a memo to Erskine laying out the teacher quality and charter
           schools options.  I wrote a pretty balanced version, because I didn't know
           if you want to include a recommendation.

            I've also attached a 1-page draft summary of the proposed challenges for
            the teacher quality speech. You may want to attach it to the memo if you
            want to provide a more detailed idea of the teacher quality approach.===============

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:          BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:       Options for the President's speech to the AFT

       There are two different issues that could serve as the news hook for the President's
speech to the AFT: teacher quality or charter schools. This memo describes the principal
announcements for each, as well as the pro's and con's of each option.

Teacher Qualitv.        The President could use the speech to address the current debate about the
quality of teachers and to layout his view for how to meet his goal of having a good teacher in
every classroom. The emphasis in the speech would be on a series of challenges by the
President, calling on: (1) states to raise teacher certification standards, require new teachers to
pass competency tests and provide alternative routes that allow potential teachers to bypass
teacher education programs; (2) colleges and universities to provide students preparing to teach
with a better liberal arts education and to strengthen teacher preparation programs or close them
down; (3) states and local school districts to reward outstanding teachers who receive
certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, and (4) teachers and
their unions to work with local school districts to create fair, faster and cheaper ways to remove
incompetent teachers from the classroom. In this context, the President could also challenge
Congress to support these efforts. There are a number of relevant provisions in the Higher
Education Act that is going to conference shortly that he could support, including a requirement
for report cards on schools of education produce, and provisions that reflect his proposal from
last year to help recruit and prepare teachers. He could also reiterate his opposition to
Goodling's provision to end funding for the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards). Finally, the President could release an Education Department report on Promising
Practices for Improving Teaching that underscores many ofthe themes in the speech.

       With growing public and media attention to teacher quality--fueled by the recent
controversy over teacher testing in Massachusetts as well as coverage of the NEAl AFT merger
proposal--the AFT speech provides an important and timely opportunity for the President to
address this issue. Because this topic is so hot, the press is likely to cover the speech despite the
absence of major new policy announcements. Indeed, it may look like he is ducking an
important if difficult issue ifhe fails to address it at the AFT.

        We will have to work closely with both the AFT and the NEA over the next few days,
particularly to make sure that they can live with the President's comments on getting rid of bad
teachers. While there is some risk that we will go too far, the approach we have in mind is not a
dramatic departure from the President's previous statements, or positions the AFT and NEA have
already taken. And the speech will lack credibility if we don't address this aspect of teacher

                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Charter Schools. The President could discuss the importance of charter schools and call on
Congress, school boards, and the AFT to lend greater support to help these schools succeed.
Citing the importance of helping charter schools become models of accountability and high
standards, the President could release a new Education Department guidebook to help public
boards conduct rigorous and fair reviews of proposals to establish charter schools, and to hold
them accountable for results. A second Education Department report, evaluating the existing
charter schools program, may also be available for release. In this approach, the President could
also challenge the Congress to send him legislation this year to expand and strengthen the charter
schools program. A push for charter schools legislation would be timely and important, because
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will be marking up a charter schools bill on
July 22.

        A speech focused on charter schools would enhance the President's leadership on this
issue, and could reinforce the private efforts we will need to make to convince reluctant Senate
Democrats to help move this legislation forward. However, part of their reluctance stems from
the opposition of the AFT (and NEA) to the proposed expansion ofthe charter schools program.
While we have worked with Kennedy to address a number of the AFT concerns, overall AFT
members remain highly skeptical of charter schools, and many see them as a stalking horse for
vouchers. Thus, astrong charter schools speech to the AFT would likely receive a luke-warm
response from the audience, regardless of how well it would play in the press.

        All of our efforts to refonn and improve schools -- ranging from higher student standards
to educational technology -- depend on having quality, well-trained teachers in classrooms across
the nation. At a time when we must demand more than ever from all of our students, we must
make sure our students have the best possible teachers. In this context, the President would call
for:

TESTING NEW TEACHERS BEFORE THEY ENTER THE CLASSROOM. The
President would call on states to require that all new teachers pass tests of basic skills and
knowledge of their subject matter before entering the classroom. He could also call on states to
require that all high school and middle school teachers have received a major or minor in the
subject areas in which they teach.

CERTIFYING TEACHERS BASED ON PERFORMANCE. The President would call on
states to overhaul the way teachers are licensed, saying all new teachers should pass tests before
entering the classroom, get rigorous training and mentoring in their first few years of teaching,
and then be required to demonstrate their ability to teach well before getting a license.
This would replace current systems that award licenses primarily based on whether or not a new
teacher has attended courses in an education school and spent a certain amount of time in a
classroom. A perfonnance-based approach would also enable states to more effectively support
"alternative routes" to certification, allowing mid-career professionals or recent liberal arts
graduates to become fully prepared and certified to teach.

REWARDING GOOD TEACHERS The President would call on states to provide merit pay
for teachers that get certification from the bipartisan National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards. He would also criticize the congressional majority for their efforts to eliminate
funding for the Board -- thereby eviscerating the only national effort to reward outstanding
teachers. He would also call on states and school districts to reward teachers whose schools
have demonstrated clear gains in student perfonnance.

REMOVING POOR TEACHERS FROM THE CLASSROOM. The President would
reiterate his call for finding fair but faster and less expensive ways of removing incompetent
teachers from the classroom. He would also call on every school district and local teachers
union in the nation to agree on policies to identify incompetent or burnt-out teachers, give them
assistance to improve quickly, and find ways to make sure that those who don't improve leave
the classroom.

HIGHER SALARIES TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A QUALITY TEACHING FORCE.
Together with tougher standards for the teaching profession, the President would call for higher
salaries to help attract and retain the quality teaching force on which our schools depend.

BETTER PREPARATION AND TRAINING FOR FUTURE TEACHERS. The President
would call on universities and states to find better ways to prepare people to become successful
teachers, including strengthening or closing down programs that are failing. The President

requirements for states to issue report cards on teacher preparation programs and new support for
states to overhaul preparation and training for new teachers -- as "steps in the right direction"

NEW REPORT. The President would release a new Education Department report on "best
practices" for promoting excellence in teaching, including recruiting, training, and holding
accountable teachers. He could also call on Secretary Riley to publish an annual report on
teacher quality, beginning this December.
