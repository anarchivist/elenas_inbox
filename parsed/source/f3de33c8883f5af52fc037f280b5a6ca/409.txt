TEXT:
I am forwarding a copy of the brief filed yesterday in the Blessing v.
Freestone Supreme Court case, just in case you haven't already received a copy.
I am also forwarding the brief APWA filed.
APWA sent a letter to Carol Rasco indicating their disappointment with the
Admistration's position. Next week I will draft a response letter and ask in
advance if you would review. Thanks!
