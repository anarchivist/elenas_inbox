TEXT:
On Friday, the Council of Economic Advisers gave me a draft of a white
paper on the reasons for the recent decline in welfare caseloads from
1993-1996. They've asked for comments
 by close of business tomorrow.  Bottom line: their statistical analysis
concludes that
        42% due to economic expansion
        32% due to welfare waivers
        26% due to other, unidentified factors·

There are many comments I'd like to make about how this information is
presented (information is often stated that exaggerates the findings on
the economy -- i.e. 42% becomes "almost half" and there are some
gratuitious comments about possible effects of the new law.)
Fundamentally, the analysis seems sound, although adding some other
variables correlated with economic expansion (i.e. increase in state child
care spending) may have resulted in a lower percentage being attributed to
economic expansion.

Question: besides these types of minor changes, what do. you want me to do
about this?
