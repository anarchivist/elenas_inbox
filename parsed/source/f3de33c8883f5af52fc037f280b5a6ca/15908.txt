TEXT:
As you are aware, earlier this afternoon, I circulated a draft OMB letter
to the Senate Finance Committee for comment by 2:30 p.m. today.   The
letter addresses the Committee's mark up of welfare-related reconciliation
language.

The following paragraphs have been proposed for insert into the draft OMB
letter.  Please provide me with comments on the insert, as well as the
rest of the letter, by today's 2:30 p.m. deadline.

Thank you for your assistance.




 Proposed Insert:


        The Administration understands that amendments may be offered during
Committee consideration, the purpose of which is to prevent costs from
increasing in Food Stamps and Medicaid due to cost-shifting for common
functions from the TANF block grant, which places a cap on TANF


administrative costs. We understand the CBO baseline includes costs of
over $5 billion in FYs 98-02 because CBO assumes administrative cots
shifting from TANF to Food Stamps and Medicaid. This proposal would
reduce the extent of the cost-shift to the Food Stamp and Medicaid
Programs, yielding substantial savings against CBOO,s baseline. While the
Administration is generally supportive of this effort -- to prevent States
from changing cost allocation plans in order to shift greater
administrative costs from the capped TANF block grant to the open-ended
Food Stamp and Medicaid administrative costs that are matched by the
Federal government -- we would need to carefully review the specific
mechanism proposed.  In particular, we would have serious reservations
about proposals that would cap Food stamps and Medicaid administrative
costs.

The budget negotiators discussed changes to the Food Stamp and Medicaid
Programs at considerable length. An amendment further reducing these
programs and directing savings to other programs was neither raised nor
included in the Budget Agreement.  The Administration has very strong
reservations about such an approach.
