From' 6-18-97 ABC News Poll

Do you think measures to reduce cigarettes smoking in the country
have gone too far, or not far enough?

Gone            Not far          About           No
too far         enough           right           opinion

Nicotine Regulation

Neither group favors the total ban of smoking either by
restricting smoking only to the smoker's home or by outlawing the
sale of cigarettes. But majorities of both favor finding a way to
regulate the use of nicotine, including most of the 13 percent of
Americans who say they're hooked on the stuff. But the two groups
part on banning cigarette advertising, with six in 10 smokers
against it and a similar number of non-smokers for it.


But when asked about some specific measures the government could
take to reduce smoking, more agreement between the two camps
emerges:

        Smokers Non-smokers
Ban all cigarette advertising
                                 38          58
Find a way to regulate the use of nicotine
68          77
Make smoking illegal in all places - indoors
and out except a smoker's own home
16          40
Make it illegal for an adult to buy cigarettes
