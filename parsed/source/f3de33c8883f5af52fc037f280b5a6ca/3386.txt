     TEXT:
     Bill White mentioned to me that he was going to forward this to you.  The
     draft scheduling request includes Bruce as one of the 3 people
     recommending this event, so if we don't want Bruce's name on it we should
     tell him to take it off the request.

     Now that this youth with disabilities conference event idea has been
     dinged by scheduling, this is Bill White's best idea for how to do a quick
     ADA event.  I think it would be nice, but not sure I can speak for Bruce
     here, so I'm bucking it to you.

REQUEST:                      To do an FDR Memorial bill signing ceremony.

PURPOSE:                      To commemorate the seventh anniversary of the.
                              Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

BACKGROUND:                   In May, the President called upon the Congress to
                              pass legislation to incorporate President Roosevelt's
                              disability in the FDR Memorial. The Senate voted
                              unanimously and the House voted 363-39 on July 8
                              to pass legislation to incorporate in the Memorial a
                              depiction of FDR in his wheelchair.

                              A ceremony to sign the legislation, which is viewed
                              by the disability community as a triumph in their
                              effort to remove the stigma of disability, would also
                              give the President an opportunity to celebrate the
                              seventh anniversary of the Americans with
                              Disabilities Act (ADA), which he does each year.
                                                             Hex-Dump ConverSion
                       The anniversary of the ADA, a civil rights law that
                       guarantees equal rights and equal opportunity for
                       the millions of Americans with disabilities, is the
                       most important day of the year for people with
                       disabilities.

                       Inviting Members of Congress, Roosevelt's
                       grandchildren, and leaders of the disability
                       communities to a FDR Memorial bill signing
                       ceremony on July 24 or 25 would be an
                       appropriate way to commemorate the ADA's
                       seventh anniversary.

PAST PARTICIPATION:    The President participated in the FDR Dedication
                       Ceremony in May, 1997 and has participated in
                       ADA ceremonies in the past.
