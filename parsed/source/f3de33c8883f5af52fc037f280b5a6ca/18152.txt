TEXT:
I've talked to Danny Werfel and Susan Carr who are handling this at OMB to
suggest this may need to be on a fast track for mid-January. Danny says
that is achievable. EEOC voted to approve sending over the regs Monday,
Ellen Vargyas says they will be sent over this week. EEOC will be coming
in to brief OMB the beginning of January.                       in their
criticisms already.
                                                 Ellen suggests that Sally
Katzen                      person to deal with on this.  I'll call her
unless you want to.
