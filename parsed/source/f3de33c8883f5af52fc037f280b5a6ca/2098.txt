TEXT:
You may want to put something in the weekly about the fact that the DPC
organized a reception for the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) on
May 1, 1997. The 250 police chiefs who attended are the most prominent
and influential voices in the law enforcement community throughout the
country. Rahm Emanuel and Joe Brann, Director of the COPS Program, spoke
to the group about key elements of the Administration's juvenile justice
legislation and elements of the budget effecting law enforcement. Bill
Bratton received PERF's Annual Leadership Award.

Other events this week:
Service Summit
HRC Teen Pregnancy Event
