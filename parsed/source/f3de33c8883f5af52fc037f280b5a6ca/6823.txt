Subject:          Chile Answers

The Chileans have come back with some answers:

1)     . They have agreed to do an interactive via satellite throughout
the nations represented at the summit with students.   Their idea is to
have one student rep from each nation ask their leader a question
regarding (what I do not know how or if they will be scripted, which could
be problematic on our side given the imaginat·ion of a HS student in the
current climate) anyway, we would need to seriously think on who this
student is asking Potus·a question and make sure they are scripted as this
will now be open to the press. They would repeat the questioning from
other students with their leaders.

2)      Valpariso was confirmed as a go from the Chileans.    They are
pretty sure that the concern will not be present at all.

3)      They have agreed to move the Trade/Economics basket to Sunday
and swap it with the leaders free lancing.

That is all for now, just wanted to pass along the latest update.    Thanks!
