     MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

     SUBJECT:       Standards to Prevent Drinking and Driving

     We have made progress in improving highway safety during our Administration. Our
     progress has been accomplished through a variety of innovative and aggressive initiatives,
     including our "Buckle Up America" Campaign to vastly increase safety belt usage and
     improve child passenger safety, and the formation of a ground-breaking public-private
     partnership on airbags. We have also taken important steps to reduce the deaths and
     injuries brought about by alcohol use and driving by signing a law to require states to
     adopt "Zero Alcohol Tolerance" laws for young people who operate motor vehicles by
     October 1998. To date, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted "zero tolerance"
     laws for youth.

     However, drunk driving remains a serious highway safety problem. Over 40 percent of all
     motor vehicle deaths in 1996 -- 17,126-- were alcohol-related. More than 2,300 of these
     fatalities were youths. Moreover, alcohol-related crashes cost society $45 billion every year, not
     including the pain and suffering endured by its victims.

     We can do more to prevent the many tragic and unnecessary alcohol-related deaths and
     injuries which occur on the Nation's roads. That is why my Administration has called on
     Congress to set .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) as the illegal per se limit nationwide. Research
     shows that, at a BAC level of .08, drivers are impaired with regard to critical driving tasks, such
     as braking, steering, lane changing, and judgment. The risk of being involved in a crash
     increases substantially when drivers are at a BAC level of .08 or above. In fact, the relative risk
     of a driver being killed in a single vehicle crash at .08 BAC has been shown to be 11 times higher
     than it is with drivers who have no alcohol in their system.

     Despite this elevated risk, in 33 states and the District of Columbia, their illegal impaired driving
     limit is still at the higher level of .10 BAC. It is estimated that, if all states were to lower their
     limits to .08 BAC, there could be 600 fewer alcohol-related traffic deaths every year.

     I hope the Congress will enact this legislation as soon as possible to encourage state passage of
     .08 BAC laws. Even before the Congress acts, however, we cart take action to promote .08 BAC
     as the appropriate standard across the country, including on federal property.

     I therefore direct you, working with appropriate Federal agencies, Congress, the States,
     safety groups and other concerned Americans, to report back to me in 45 days with a plan
     to promote the adoption of a .08 BAC illegal per se limit, including on federal property.
     The plan shall address, among other things, an education campaign to help the public
     understand the risks associated with alcohol consumption and driving.
