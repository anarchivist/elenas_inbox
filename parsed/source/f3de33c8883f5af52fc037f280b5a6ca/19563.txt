Subject:

Governor Carper's office just indicated that the issue of FLSA - and the
Treasury ruling on whether TANF payments will be treated as income for
federal income and employment purposes - may be brought up at tomorrow's
Governors meeting. You will recall that the Governor's have been pressing
Treasury for this ruling since last summers NGA meeting in Las Vegas, and
the ruling was poised for announcement before the Governors Winter meeting
here in Washington but was postponed at Governor Carper's request because
he wanted to avoid that controversy with the Governors here. Two months
later, they are eager for it to come out and will ask about its status.
