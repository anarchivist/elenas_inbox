TEXT:
I can't believe it, but the radio address looks like it's falling
through.  I hear Eli spoke to you about it. After we went over what we
wanted with the Corporation a million times, they sent us a draft address
today that didn't even mention the week of service idea, which was the
central concept, let alone talk about ramping it up.  This is getting
pretty ridiculous, particularly after we had to scrap the high school
scholars thing the other day.  Anyway, Eli says he is recommending to Don
that we do a different topic for the radio address this week, and do the
scholars next week.  I don't feel like I can argue against that plan when
the Corporation isn't coming forward with anything. All I can say is I
will do my best to vet these things better in advance with the Corporation
from now on.
