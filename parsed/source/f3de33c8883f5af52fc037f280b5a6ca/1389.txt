TEXT:
Just so you know in case it comes up, there seems to be a flurry of
nervousness about our plans for the summit -- Torkelson is yelling at
Silverman that there is no scheduling request yet (see his response
attached; I don't have her note tb him). We hadn't submitted one yet
because we genuinely haven't decided which events to recommend,
complicated by his injury. We were hoping that the draft options memo we
sent to Erskine would serve as a vehicle to make this decision in the next
day or two, but that document is stuck in communications at the moment.
Also, we had a meeting today with Harris's media guy, Don Baer, Ann Lewis,
and our press people, where the intense media interest in this was
highlighted again. At the end Don stood up and said he would call a
meeting for first thing in the morning because "we have to start over" on
the memo, or something like that.  I think he was motivated by concern
that this thing is so big and we need to be in it, but I thought we knew
that already.

I'm not asking you to do anything;    I assume our little team will figure
this out.

Subject:         Re: Philadelphia Citizens Service Summit

Just so people know, today is the the very first I've heard that today is
some sort of deadline. We have worked very closely with Scheduling
(Hawley), Advance (Rosenthal), Communications (Baer, Lewis, Attie) to
figure out the schedule for Presidential participation. A memo is going
forward today or tomorrow which makes these recommendations. The
President's injury needs to be factored.  We are working to a decision,
but we are not there yet. The reason there's no scheduling request in is
because we all agreed that it was best to get sign-off of
communications/scheduling plan which includes all the principals (both
lead-up and summit itself), before we went forward with a scheduling
request in any ad hoc way. This process has been clearly laid out for two w


  eeks.   A scheduling request would've been premature before middle of this
  week.

  This said, we are working towards a meeting with Erskine for Wedesday to
  get some closure on this very salient issue. Thanks. Any questions, please
  call.

 I just spoke to Dan and Anne. We'll try to get closure by end of day
 Wednesday so we can resolve this. Believe me, there's much interest in
 getting to closure.

  Jodie, if this plan doesn't work, let me know. Quicker action would need
  to be pushed from above.   Thanks very much. Steve
