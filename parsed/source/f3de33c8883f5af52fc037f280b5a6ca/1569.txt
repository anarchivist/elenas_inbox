TEXT:
Markup of HHS technicals is I believe still scheduled for April 9th.     Two
issues:

1) Agency letters -- We have letters from Interior and Veterans describing
important technicals that were not included.   I don't see why we shouldn't
let them say their piece. No letter from DOJ yet. We have letters from
SSA and HHS which praise Shaw and Levin. Some people seem to think the
 raise is over t e top.   I don't see any real problem with it--as I P6/(b)(6)
        P6/(b)(6)   one can never over-do the stroking of Congressional
egos!  I think the SSA letter should be changed to clarify that it speaks
only for SSA (it now says "I am pleased that your bill includes virtually
all of the amendments recommended by SSA, the Department of Health and
Human Services, and other Federal agencies." I would have them drop all
after SSA.)

2) More importantly   I have been thinking about the HHS bifurcation work
proposal: Do you want to get together to discuss or shall I put my
thoughts on paper?
