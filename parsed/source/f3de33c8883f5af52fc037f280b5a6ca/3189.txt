     TEXT:
     The Presdiential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS (PACHA) sent a letter to
     the President regarding discrimination policies related to HIV/AIDS and
     the policy of several Federal agencies - US Foreign Services, Peace Corps,
     Job Corps, US State Department, Military - requiring mandatory HIV
     testing, and exclusion of those found to be HIV positive.

     I have attached a copy of the letter for your review.

     Presidential Correspondence is asking for some guidance in responding to
     this letter.  Please let me know how DPC usually handles issues that span
     several agencies, so that I can coordinate an appropriate response.

     Thanks,

     The Honorable William Jefferson Clinton
     The White House
     Washington, D.C. 20500

     Dear Mr. President:

     On February 7, 1997, the Office of National AIDS Policy Director Patsy Fleming met with
     representatives of this Council and representatives of several Federal agencies to discuss
     elimination of discrimination against those infected with HIV. I am writing to you to express
     our deep concern about the lack of progress by those Federal agencies toward elimination of
     discriminatory policies. You will remember that almost three years ago you asked this Council
     to meet with you to discuss issues of major concern regarding HIV/AIDS. One of the most
     critical issues raised was the previously established policy of several Federal agencies (i.e., the
     U.S. Foreign Services, the Peace Corps, the Job Corps, the U.S. State Department, and the
     Military) requiring mandatory HIV testing, and exclusion ofthose found to be HIV positive.

     At that time, you expressed your concern about and disapproval of such policies and instructed
     your staff to investigate those policies and report back to you. We are dismayed that the
     February 7, 1997 meeting clearly confirmed that policies requiring mandatory testing and
     exclusion from entry of all applicants found to be HIV positive continue in these agencies. The
     policies of these Federal agencies represent a disturbing aberation from the general application of
      HIV/AIDS employment practices by the vast majority of federal agencies.

     We are also concerned that those already employed by such agencies who later test positive face
     discrimination in assignments, promotions, and career advancement opportunities. Particularly
     in light of the promise offered by new treatment options, these policies serve to deprive qualified
     HIV-positive individuals equal employment opportunity and to deprive the federal government of
     the contributions those individuals could be making as dedicating public servants.

     The Council has little optimism that without your intervention these discriminatory policies
     might be changed. We would therefore urge, Mr. President, that you renew your instructions for
     review and reconsideration of such policies. It is only through such action that your
     commitment "to fight AIDS related discrimination at every turn" contained in your National
     AIDS Strategy can be realized.

     Your Council stands ready to assist in any way you deem appropriate.

     Thank you for your consideration and concern.

     Sincerely,


     Scott Hitt, MD
     on behalf of the Council



                                                                Automated Records Management System
     Final                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
