                                       President Clinton's 21st Century Policing Initiative
                                                       January 14, 1999

              Today, at the Alexandria Police Department, President Clinton will announce: (I) the release of new
              crime statistics showing that crime rates will continue to drop significantly in 1998; and (2) the
              inclusion in the FY 2000 budget of nearly $1.3 billion for a new 21 st Century Policing Initiative.
              The new 21 st Century Policing Initiative builds on the President's successful COPS program by
              helping communities to continue to hire, redeploy, and retain police officers; giving law enforcement
              access to the latest crime-fighting technologies; and targeting funds to engage the entire community in
              preventing and fighting crime -- including local prosecutors, probation and parole officers, school
              officials, faith-based organizations and others in the community.

              Crimes Rates Continue to Decline in 1998

              ·       New Mid-year Data for 1998. Today, for the first time, the Justice Department's Bureau of
                      Justice Statistics (BJS) released mid-year data showing that crime rates will continue to
                      decline in 1998. According to BJS, the total number of violent crimes -- including crimes not
                      reported to police -- is expected to fall below 3 million in 1998 for the first time since the start
                      of its National Crime Victimization Survey in 1973. Property crimes will also continue to
                      decline to record lows. By the end of 1998, both violent and property crime rates will have
                      fallen by well over 20 percent since 1993.

              ·       Murder rates down dramatically. Recently, BJS also released a study showing that
                      homicide rates have dropped to their lowest level in 30 years. If the current rates remain
                      steady through the end of 1998, the murder rate will have dropped by more than 30 percent
                      since 1993.

              Giving Police the Support and Tools They Need

              ·       Renewing the COPS program. The President's FY 2000 budget proposes nearly $1.3
                      billion -- and $6.375 billion over the next five years -- for a new 21st Century Policing
                      Initiative to help communities build on their efforts under the successful COPS program.
                      Without these new funds, the COPS program would have expired this year, shortly after
                      meeting its goal of helping communities put 100,000 more police on the street. Nationallaw
                      enforcement organizations all support extending funding for the COPS program.

               ·      21st Century Policing Initiative. The 21 st Century Policing program is designed to help
                      communities continue to hire, redeploy, and retain police officers; to give law enforcement
                      access to the latest crime-fighting technologies; and to engage the entire community in
                      preventing and fighting crime -- including local prosecutors, probation and parole officers,
                      school officials, faith-based organizations, and many others. Specifically, the initiative, as
                      outlined in the FY 2000 budget, calls for the following investments:

                      - $600 million for more police on the street. Similar to the current COPS program, these
                      funds would be used primarily to continue to hire and redeploy an estimated 8,000 police
                      officers each year, with an effort to target these new officers to crime "hot spots." A portion
                      of the funds would also be dedicated to help economically-distressed communities absorb the
                      long-term costs of their new police hires, as well as for special programs to train, educate and
                      recruit police officers.

- $350 million for crime-fighting technologies. These funds would be used to help state
and local enforcement agencies tap into new technologies that will allow them to
communicate more effectively, solve more crimes, and conduct comprehensive crime
analysis. Examples include:

       Improved police communications. The World Trade Center and Oklahoma City
       bombings dramatically illustrated the need for police to communicate effectively in     ·
       joint operations. In Alexandria, the police department is piloting a number of
       different technologies (computers, wireless communications, video cams, software,
       and databases) that will enable police and other public safety officials to communicate
       and send data and images seamlessly across many jurisdictions. The President's new
       initiative will allow other communities to do the same, as well as to improve their
       communications in other ways.

       New crime-solving technologies. We can solve many more crimes by improving the
       nation's overburdened and underfunded crime labs. The President's initiative
       proposes making high-end technologies -- such as DNA analysis, photo enhancement
       and voice recognition -- available to even the smallest police departments.

        Bolstering Crime Analysis. As more police departments move toward community
        policing, many have found that their greatest tool is real time crime and arrest data
        that allows them to put their crime problems into context. A notable example is New
        York's COMPSTAT project, which utilizes computerized statistics and mapping to
        analyze crime trends and allocate police resources. The President's new initiative
        will help local police departments tap into crime mapping and other technologies that
        will improve police's ability to quickly analyze, respond to and potentially predict
        local crime problems.

- $200 million for "Neighborhood DAs." As police and community residents have joined
forces to fight crime on a proactive basis, communities are turning to local prosecutors to play
a more active role in the crime-fighting effort. In Multnomah County, OR, "Neighborhood
DAs" work closely with local police, spend time in their neighborhoods, and help solve local
crime problems. The President's initiative will help local prosecutors throughout the country
to hire more personnel to do the same.

- $125 million for community-wide crime prevention. Finally, the President's 21st
Century Policing proposes specifically targeting funds to engage the entire community in
preventing and fighting crime. These funds could be used to: work with probation and parole
officers in supervising released offenders; work with local school officials in adopting
community-wide plans to prevent school violence; involve faith-based organizations in
juvenile crime prevention; and establish citizens' police academies that teach neighborhood
residents problem-solving skills.
