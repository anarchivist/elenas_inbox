TEXT:
Gregoire is sending out documents describing the deal to the AGs today.
She is
backing this up with a set of conf calls today.  The goal is a deal
announcement for Monday.  However, apparently the tobacco companies have
said they will only do the deal Mon if there are no leaks before them -
yet there are some leaks today and more expected tomorrow.
