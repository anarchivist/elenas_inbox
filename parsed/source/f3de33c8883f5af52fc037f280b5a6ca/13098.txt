     TEXT:

     HR 1170, which would require that a three judge court determine the
     constitutionality of laws passed by State referendum, is scheduled for House
     floor action next week. We originally circulated a draft SAP in June.
     Please provide any comments on this draft SAP by Noon Friday - Sept. 22nd.
     Karin and David - since this is an oppose we should have a PAD (Litan) sign
     off.
     Art - the CBO report says that HR 1170 is not paygo - do we agree?



     DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE        September     ,1995
             (House)


     H.R. 1170 - Three
     o
     -Judge District Court
     (Bono (R) California and 46 cosponsors)

     The Administration opposes H.R. 1170 because it would unnecessarily burden the
     Federal judicial system and delay appellate review.
     H.R. 1170 would require applications for injunctions, based on the
     constitutionality of laws passed by State referendum, to be determined by
     three
     o
     -judge district courts and the decisions to be appealable directly to the
     Supreme Court. A requirement, similar to the three
     o
     -judge
     o
     -court provision
     contained in H.R. 1170, was repealed by Congress in 1976.          The requirement was


repealed because (1) limiting statutes and jurisdictional decisions made the
requirements obsolete and (2) the three
o
-judge
o
-courts were complicated to
administer and were an inefficient use of judicial resources.  These reasons
are equally valid today, and the repeal should remain in effect.
