TEXT:
When you review what I have done on Cardin, please look at this slightly
revised version. Thanks.

SECOND DRAFT    July 8, 1997

An Amendment to Allow a Tax Credit for Costs and Fees Paid for
Supplementary Educational Services for Children
[possible substitute for Cardin)

 Credit would be for up to [$150 or 50% of the costs incurred, whichever
is less--Cardin amount) per year per child ages 6-18, enrolled as a full
time elementary or secondary school student

 Credit would be for costs and fees paid

 Services provided must be supplementary to the basic educational program,
and can include extra help/tutoring in core academic subjects, including
reading and math, [that the student is studying in school--Cardin language
) [as well as enrichment in art, music etc.); the credit is not available
for regular tuition costs

  [Allowable services may not include college entrance test preparation
--Cardin language)

 Services must be provided outside the regular school day, which can
include before- or after-school, during summers, or on weekends

 Consistent with Title I and the Supreme CourtD,s ruling in Agostini vs.
Felton , services may be provided at a public school or at another site
(including private religious schools), but may not include sectarian
instruction.

 Services must be provided by the local school district, or under contract
,-

     to the local school district, consistent with Title I.

     Note: Some districts currently provide after-school or summer services for
     free; others have elected to charge for them.   In localities where the
     services are provided for free, there is no need for the tax credit
     because after-school services are already available.  In localities where
     services are only available for a fee, the legislation would aid families
     that want extra services for their children. In communities where
     after-school tutoring is primarily provided in venues such as Boys and
     Girls Clubs, the school district could agree to contract with such
     organizations to provide the services, Where no services are currently
     offered, the tax credit may encourage districts to begin offering such
     services.

     Because the services would be provided under the auspices of the local
     school district, there would be no need for any sort of D&certificationD8
     process as envisioned in the Cardin legislation, Services could be
     provided through private organizations under contract to school districts
     to the same extent they can presently be provided under Title I.
