                             PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                             REMARKS FOR CLONING EVENT
                                   THE ROSE GARDEN
                                      JUNE 9, 1997

      Acknowledgments: Vice President Gore; Secretary Shalala; Dr. Harold Varmus, Dir.,
NIH; Dr. Jack Gibbons, the President's Advisor on Science and Technology; President's
Committee of Advisors of Science and Technology.

        I want to express my deep gratitude to the Dr. Shapiro and the National Bioethics
Advisory Committee for preparing this report. As Dr. Shapiro mentioned, the time was short,
the topic was sensitive, and the ground to be covered was wide. I thank each of you for your
commitment and your courage to break new ground in public policy making.

        As the remarkable breakthrough in cloning we are here to address makes so clear, we are
living in a breathtaking era of scientific discovery. More and more, America's future -- and the
world's future -- depend on science and technology. And more and more, the scientific
community will influence the course of that future, and the lives our children will lead in the 21 st
century. As I said in my commencement address at Morgan State University last month, our
scientific explorations must be guided by our commitment to human values, the good of society,
and our basic sense of right from wrong.

        The possibility of creating a child through these new techniques mandates that we
proceed with caution, and with conscience. That is why I acted immediately to ban the use of
any federal funds for the cloning of human beings, and I urged the private sector to do the right
thing and observe this ban voluntarily. And that is why I asked the National Bioethics Advisory
Commission to prepare this report.

       For three months, you have explored the scientific, moral and spiritual dimensions of
human cloning. You have talked to leading scientists and religious leaders; philosophers and
concerned families; patient advocates and the general public. And you have reached the
following conclusion: cloning a human being is unacceptably dangerous and morally
unacceptable, and we must act to prevent anyone -- for any reason -- from doing so.

        I agree with the Commission's conclusions, and I accept your recommendation. Today, I
will send legislation to Congress that prohibits the cloning of human beings for the next 5 years,
and protects our fundamental human values. I am confident that Congress will act soon to pass
this legislation, but until that time, the moratorium I declared in March will remain in effect.
Once again, I call upon the private sector to refrain from using these techniques to attempt to
clone a human being. There is still to much that we do not know -- and too much that we do not
agree on -- to take the risk of creating innocent children in this untested way.

                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
                I want to make clear that there is nothing inherently immoral or wrong with the new
        cloning techniques. In fact, these techniques hold out the promise of revolutionary new medical
        treatments and life-saving cures; of better crops and stronger livestock. Cloning human tissues
        and cells is already helping to improve the lives of millions of people, and this legislation will
        not prohibit the use of the new techniques to do it. And it will not ban the cloning of animals for
        agricultural or veterinary purposes.

               What it will do is give us time to continue the national dialogue we began three months
        ago. It will give the scientific community time to investigate the viability and the safety of these
        new techniques. It will give us time to reaffirm our most cherished beliefs about the miracle of
        human life, and the God-given individuality that each person possesses. Or, it will give us time
        to broaden those beliefs to include a new mystery, if to do so harms none and benefits all.

               To make sure that all of our voices are heard as we explore the possibility of human
        cloning, the legislation specifically requires the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to
        continue to study the issue and report back to Congress after four and a half years. At that time,
        we will decide whether the ban will continue, or whether we will enter a new chapter of human
        life.

                We are still a long way from understanding all of the implications of this remarkable
        breakthrough. But it is our obligation and our honor to confront the issues it raises, as a people.
        I am confident that the step we are taking today will continue that process. Once again, I thank
        the National Bioethics Advisory Commission for the work you have done and will continue to do
        in the coming years.

               Thank you and God bless you.
