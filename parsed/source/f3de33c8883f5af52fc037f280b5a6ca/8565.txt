             SELECTED QUOTES OF HOUSE MEMBERS SUPPORTING
                        RAISING TOBACCO TAXES
            A number ofHouse Members have expressed support for raising taxes on tobacco. Below is a
     sample:

     Gingrich Said He Believed We Needed to Pass Bill Raising the Cost of Cigarettes
     Addressing the American Medical Association on March 9, 1998, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said,
      "And I believe we do have a public health responsibility to pass a very strong anti-teen smoking bill this
     year -- a bill which raises the cost or buying cigarettes and a bill which indicates clearly we're not going
     to tolerate cigarette companies preying upon 12-, 13-, and 14-year-olds. But I don't think we have to
     payoff the tobacco companies to tell them we're not going to allow them to addict our children."
     [Gingrich Remarks before the American Medical Association (transcribed by Federal Document
     Clearinghouse), 3/9/98]


     Gingrich Pitched Idea of Increasing Tobacco Taxes
     According to the February 3,1998 Washington Times, "Republican House leaders are quietly kicking
     around a new idea: Raising taxes to cut taxes. Specifically, GOP leaders are considering increasing
     taxes on cigarettes as much as $1.50 per pack and using the bulk of the money to deliver tax cuts to other
     constituencies, such as married couples. House Speaker Newt Gingrich pitched the idea to his deputies
     last week."

            Gingrich spokeswoman Christina Martin: "Speaker Gingrich repeated in the presence of GOP
            leadership that any tax increase -- be it a compulsory takingfrom tobacco companies or any other
            means -- must be offset by a tax cut. No tax increase will go forward without an accompanying
            tax cut for the American people." [Washington Times, 2/3/98]


     Armey Was Open to Gingrich's Idea of Raising Tobacco Taxes
     The same Washington Times article reported that, "Mr. Armey was open to Mr. Gingrich's idea of using
     tax increases to pay for tax cuts, but he suggested that any cigarette-tax money be used for Me.dicare and
     Medicaid -- the national health insurance programs for the elderly and poor." [Washington Times, 2/3/98]

            USA Today reported that, "Republicans are lining up behind a plan to use tobacco industry money
            'solely for teen smoking (reduction) and health care programs,' House Majority Leader Dick
            Armey, R-Texas, said." [USA Today, 2/4/98]


     Kasich Said He Didn't Care If They Raised the Price of a Pack of Cigarettes to $100
     According to the February 5, 1998 Washington Times, House Budget Committee Chainnan John R.
     Kasich (R-OH) "likes the idea of raising the tobacco tax to pay for other tax breaks."

            Kasich: "Personally, I don't care ifthey raise the price ora pack or cigarettes to $ JOO."
            [Washington Times, 2/5/98]
            Kasich also said, "Let's say we don't get a tobacco settlement, then Republicans would have to
                                                                                               Management System
                                                                          Automated Records .

                                                                           Hex- .....
       tax cut." [Los Angeles Times, 2/5/98]


Rep. Nancy Johnson Thought Increasing Tobacco Taxes Was "A Good Idea"
Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-CT) on an increase in tobacco taxes: "Frankly, I think it is a good idea. It's
far simpler than a settlement and will accomplish the goal of discouraging young smokers." [Washington
 Times, 2/5/98]


Armey Supported Hutchinson and Blunt Plan on How to Spend Tobacco Settlement Money
On February 5, 1998, Reps. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR) and Roy Blunt (R-MO) unveiled a plan laying out
how money from a tobacco settlement could be spent. Majority Leader Armey supported the plan even
though, according to the Washington Times "the tobacco settlement could include a cigarette tax
increase." Under Hutchinson and Blunt's plan, money from a tobacco settlement would go first to fund
whatever programs were agreed to under the deal, such as teen smoking reduction, health care and
biomedical research. Two-thirds of any remaining money would go for debt reduction and a third for tax
relief. [Washington Times, 2/6/98]


Hutchinson Was "Leaning to Open" on Question of Tobacco Tax Increase; Blunt Would Discuss it
At the press conference in which they released their plan to spend money raised from the tobacco
settlement, Blunt and Hutchinson were asked if they could support a cigarette tax increase to pay for a
broad-based tax reduction.

       Hutchinson responded: "I'm not speaking for anybody but me, but put me as undecided, leaning to
       open on that question."

       Blunt answered: "I think that has some possibility of happening. And really, under our
       legislation, ifyou decided to take all of the extra money from the settlement and give it to a tax
       decrease, that's one way you could, we can at least discuss modifying this. We happen to think
       it's better to start paying back the trust funds." [House Majority Leader Dick Armey News
       Conference to Introduce Tobacco Related Legislation with Reps. Hutchinson, Blunt, and Barton
       (Federal Document Clearing House), 2/5/98]


Republican Leadership Aide Said They Would "Raise" the President's Tobacco Revenue Plan
According to the Los Angeles Times, in response to President Clinton's plan to put $65.5 billion in new
tobacco revenue over five years in his fiscal 1999 budget, an unnamed aide to Congress' Republican
leadership said, "We'll see him and raise him. Consider this an aggressive trial balloon." [Los Angeles
Times, 2/5/98]
