Fight Flares Over State Tobacco
                      Settlements
                      01:45 a.m. Feb 04, 1999 Eastern

                        By Steve Holland

                        WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan
                        group of 25 senators introduced legislation
                        Wednesday that would block the federal
                        government from taking a share of the money
                        that states obtained through settlements of
                        tobacco lawsuits.

                        --These settlements belong to the states,"   said
                        a leader of group, Texas Republican Sen. Kay
                        Bailey Hutchison. --Because of the possible
                        threat of federal seizure, many states, including
                        Texas, are unable to plan and to spend the
                        money for the benefit of their citizens. ' ,

                        Forty-six states two months ago reached a
                        $206 billion settlement with the main tobacco
                        companies, partly to compensate them for
                        smoking-related spending in Medicaid, a
                        health program for the poor that is jointly
                        funded by states and the federal government.

                        The federal government believes it has a claim
                        to a portion of any Medicaid reimbursement.
                        President Clinton's five-year budget
                        projections, released this week, assume the
                        federal government will take $18.9 billion in
                        state funds through 2004.


                    The legislation, written by Hutchison and
                    Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham, would
                    prevent that. It would prevent the federal
                    government from cutting Medicaid payments
                    to states as a way of recouping federal
                    Medicaid payments made earlier for treating
                    smokers' ailments.

                    State governments are angry that the federal
                    government now wants to corne in and take
                    some of the proceeds from lawsuit settlements
                    that they fought hard over.

                    --The federal government never offered states
                    any help when they were pursuing cases
                    against the tobacco industry,' said Graham.

                    He urged the federal government to go ahead
                    with plans to file a federal lawsuit against
                    tobacco companies to gain receipt of billions
                    of dollars in federal dollars spent treating
                    smoking-related illnesses.

                    --It shouldn't look for a free ride from the
                    states, " he said.

                    White House domestic policy chief Bruce
                    Reed said the White House would oppose the
                    Hutchison-Graham legislation because it
                    , 'would completely give up the federal share of
                    the states' tobacco settlement -- without any
                    commitment by the states to use these monies
                    to prevent youth smoking, protect tobacco
                    farmers, improve public health, or assist
                    children. ' ,

                    Reed said an average of 57 percent of the
                    money states get back are for costs borne by
                    the federal government.

                    --The administration believes that these funds
                    should be spent on purposes related to
                    tobacco, public health and children, " Reed
                    said.

                    He said the White House would work with the
                    states and Congress to enact tobacco
                    legislation that resolves the federal claim to
                    settlement funds in exchange for a commitment
                    by the state to use the federal share to support
                    these priorities.
