           FOOD SAFETY STUDY AND NEWS STORY

           USDA has prepared data on the effectiveness of your science-based food safety program, Hazard
           Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), which shows an almost 50 percent reduction in the
           frequency of salmonella in broiler chickens and an almost 40 percent reduction in the frequency
           of salmonella in swine. These data, while preliminary, indicate that HACCP is already having a
           significant impact on the safety of food American families eat. The DPC provided this data to
           the Washington Post which plans to use it in a story this Sunday or Monday. We are using this
           study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Administration program and to urge Congress to
           provide full funding for your Food Safety Initiative. It appears that the Agricultural
           Appropriations conference will meet formally early next week, and we hope this study influences
           their deliberations.
