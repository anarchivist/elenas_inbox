TEXT:
Here it is.   Kathy McKiernan of the press office wanted these by 11:30.

I don't obviously know what happened in the meeting, but I hope to talk to
Emily.

Also, I don't know what exactly was left standing in the NGA policy.  The
softened policy was reported on extensively in the Times.  But the Post
says NGA left intact the policy on letting people keep benefits while
they're awaiting INS action on their citizenship application.   If so, I
wonder if we can characterize the NGA as seeking to reopen the bill more
than I did in the attached writeup.

Question:   Didn't the President suffer a major defeat in his quest to fix the welfare law, with
            the action by the NGA to drop its opposition to legal immigrant cuts?

Answer:     The NGA is not dropping its concerns, just restating them in gentler language.

            As the new welfare law is being implemented, the Governors are gaining a new
            appreciation of some parts of the bill that the President has had a problem with
            from the beginning -- those parts that are not related to putting people to work.
            This is particularly true of those Governors in states with large numbers of legal
            immigrants. They are now looking more carefully at their state budgets and the
            fact that many legal immigrants who are disabled, many in nursing homes, will
            lose their SSI and Medicaid over the summer. In addition to noting that these
            provisions are unfair, they can see the potential costs to their own state budgets if
            they make the decision to ameliorate those cuts.

            Because of pressure from the Congressional leadership, it appears that the NGA
            will now adopt a policy that is somewhat watered down from earlier drafts.
            While we would wish for stronger language, the key fact is that the Governors are
            now on record expressing concerns about the fairness of these provisions.

Question:   But don't you think that those Governors who care about this issue hurt their case
            by flip-flopping, and ultimately caving in to the Republican leadership in
            Congress?

            The National Governors' Association has a long history of bipartisanship that
            causes them to move very cautiously on many issues. The President understands
            that group very well, having headed it up when he was Governor of Arkansas. In
            that context, we believe their new policy on benefits for legal immigrants is very
            encouraging.

Question:    The President says he is ready to work with Congress to fix the immigrant and
            food stamp parts of the welfare law, but the Republican leadership says the bill is
            fine as it is. Even Mr. Gephardt just said the bill shouldn't be changed until we
            have had a chance to see how it works. Doesn't this mean your proposals will be
            dead on arrival?

Answer:     We have seen movement from the Governors, on both sides of the aisle, on this
            issue, even though their final resolution was weakened under pressure from the
            Congressional leadership. So we are encouraged that people are beginning to see
            the harm that these provisions could do to hard-working people who came to this
            country and, through, no fault of their own, became disabled and could no longer
                                                                                 h~A-Uump Convcision


            support their families,

            I know that the President is encouraged also as he starts his second term that we
            are seeing some real changes in our relationship with the Congress. It appears
            that we have gotten past some of the unproductive ways of doing business we
            have had over the past two years, and that we are learning how to work with one
            another in a far more constructive fashion.

            Clearly the Administration and Congress often have different priorities, and our
            disagreements will not be swept away. Nor should they be, since a healthy
            debate is part of what the American people are paying us for. But we are looking
            forward to working with the Congress in a continuing process of give and take,
            and explaining why our proposals merit their support,


Question:   How much money does the President's budget contain for welfare reform?

Answer:     As you know, the President sends his budget to Congress on Thursday, so we will
            have more to say on that at that time. There are two sets of numbers for welfare
            reform in the budget: money for the Welfare to Work Initiative and money to
            improve areas of the welfare law -- in particular, on legal immigrants and food
            stamps -- that the President has objected to from the beginning.

Question:   What do the Administration propose to do in its welfare to work initiative?

Answer:     The Welfare to Work Initiative is still being designed, but it would help move
            hard-to-place welfare recipients off of the welfare rolls and into work. The
            initiative would likely have two parts: 1) a performance-based welfare-to-work
            jobs challenge to help states and cities create job opportunities for the hardest to
            employ recipients, and 2) an enhanced and targeted Work Opportunity Tax Credit
            to provide the private sector with powerful and new financial incentives to hire
            the hard to place welfare recipients.

Question:   How is the Administration going to move people from welfare to work when there
            are no jobs?

Answer:     I believe jobs are available and that the welfare rolls will continue to decline.
            Minimum wage jobs have always been open, but the package of welfare benefits
            previously available offered more to recipients than a minimum wage job. Now,
            with increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit, child care subsidies, and other
            provisions that makes work pay, welfare recipients can afford to take those
            available minimum wage jobs. Once working, former welfare recipients will
            gain the employment experience necessary to move up the ladder of work.

            But, we will need more jobs -- and jobs that pay more than the minimum wage if




            we are ensure the success of the new welfare law. The combination of private
            sector commitments, such as those made by the CEOs with whom I recently met,
            economic development, tax credits, additional welfare-to-work funds, and a focus
            on jobs in the growing technology industry will create the new, higher paying jobs
            we need.



Question:   The welfare law gives you the choice of how many disabled children will be cut
            off of the SSI program. Have you made this decision yet?

Answer:     The Social Security Administration is now working to implement the new law
            fairly and effectively. Writing this new standard is an important task since it
            must be consistent with the Congress's intent to tighten eligibility for this
            program, and also ensure that severely disabled children retain their benefits,
            including Medicaid. SSA expects to finish their work shortly.
