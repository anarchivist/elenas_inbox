                      PRESENT ATION OF THE CLONING REPORT

                               DATE:          June 9, 1997
                               LOCATION:      Rose Garden
                               BRIEFING TIME: 11 :00 am - 11:30 am
                               EVENT TIME:    11:30 am - 12:10 am
                               FROM:          Jack Gibbons, Elena Kagan

I.     PURPOSE

       To receive the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) report on the possible
       cloning of human beings, and to announce your response to the NBAC recommendations.

II.    BACKGROUND

       In February, following reports of the first successful cloning of an adult sheep, you asked
       NBAC to review the profound ethical issues raised by the possible cloning of human beings.
       At this event, Dr. Harold Shapiro, the Chair of the Commission and President of Princeton
       University, will formally present you with its report.

       NBAC unanimously concluded that it is morally unacceptable at this time to create a child by
       using the technology that created Dolly the sheep, and that the cloning of DNA, cells, tissues,
       and animals using somatic cell nuclear transfer and other cloning techniques is not ethically
       problematic, may have many agricultural and medical benefits, and should not be banned.
       The Commission chose not to address at all issues related to embryo research, including the
       cloning of embryos. The legislation recommended by the Commission bans only the "Dolly"
       technology to create human beings.

       You will be making the following announcements to respond to the NBAC recommendations:
       ·      Propose legislation prohibiting [for 5 years] the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to
              create a human being. The legislation also directs NBAC to report back in 4 Y, years
              on whether to continue the ban.
       ·      Keep in effect the moratorium you put in place in March so that while legislation is
              pending no federal funds will be used to clone human beings,
       ·      Urge privately-funded scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary
                      moratorium you called for in March while legislation is pending.
