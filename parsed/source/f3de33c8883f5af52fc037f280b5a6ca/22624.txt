            TEXT:
            i read this transcript last night from the little laptop they gave me to
            take horne while i'm recovering. anyway, the point is you were absolutely
            100 percent on the mark and entirely fantastic. your answers were
            informative and easy to understand without being lengthy.  and, of course,
            you knew the policy inside out.  thanks for doing the interview, elena.   i
            am convinced you scored some points on the president's behalf. bb
