TEXT:
Clara Shin held a meeting-of the council this afternoon in which she
handed out a piece of paper which listed Counsel's Office as lead on CRA;
Counsel's office as lead on Education; and Counsel's office as lead on
wage gap and hate crimes. We were listed as second or not as all.    I made
it clear to Clara at the meeting, that we (DPC) were not comfortable
establishing new processes for something on which we have been the lead
traditionally.  I assume of course, that this is our position. However,
Clara indicated that you had implied that it was OK that Counsel be the
lead on these issues.  I think there is some confusion, and I believe it
would be useful if you could let Clara or Maria know, we will continue to
serve as both long range and short term leads on these issues, although of
course we will be happy to provide the Council with updates.

Please advise.
