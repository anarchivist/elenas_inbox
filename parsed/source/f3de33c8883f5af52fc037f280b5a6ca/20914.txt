TEXT:
Since we were not lucky enough to find another family to highlight at
tomorrow's welfare event so far, we should plan on Vesta Kimble speaking.
She is the Deputy Director of Social Services in Anne Arundel County and
she will speak about how the Medicaid extension in Maryland has been
instrumental in moving people from welfare to work. She refer to specific
examples -- anonymously!  Andrea and I will be working with her on her
remarks. Thanks.
