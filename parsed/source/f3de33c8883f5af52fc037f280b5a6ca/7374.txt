Q:   What is your reaction to the Medicare Trustees report released yesterday?

     I am extremely encouraged by the Medicare Trustees report released yesterday. Thanks
     to the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, which provided for more plan
     choices, new preventive benefits, and structural and payment reforms, the life of the
     Medicare Trust Fund has been extended through 2008, a decade from today.

     This report also shows that the historic BBA Medicare reforms halved the program's
     long-term deficit. The year's 75-year "actuarial deficit" -- the measure used by the
     actuaries to compare program spending to projected revenues -- is nearly one-half of last
     year's deficit, and the lowest that it has been since the Trustees began reporting this
     statistic in 1985.

     We know that Medicare still faces long-term financing and delivery challenges that must
     be addressed. The program not only faces major demographic changes, but also must
     cope with an ever-changing health care delivery system that is being altered by new
     technology and other difficult-to-predict advances in health care. Although these
     complexities will be more difficult to address than the challenges facing the Social
     Security program, I am confident that the bipartisan Medicare Commission can build on
     the successes of the BBA to make additional recommendations that will further
     strengthen the program.


Q:   Clearly, the Congress is not going to enact your Medicare buy-in proposal, was this
     proposal just an effort to play politics with this issue?

A:   Absolutely not. We are going to continue to urge Congress to pass this proposal to allow
     Americans ages 55 to 65 to buy into the Medicare program. This is a carefully targeted,
     paid for proposal that will not hurt the Medicare Trust Fund or undermine the balanced
     budget, and it helps an extremely vulnerable population that the health insurance market
     has failed. There is absolutely no reason provide another choice for the hundreds of
     thousands of Americans who have no affordable health care options today.
