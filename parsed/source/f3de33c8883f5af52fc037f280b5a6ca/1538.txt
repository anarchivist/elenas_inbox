TEXT:
Do we want to try to get either of these or both on the President's
schedule?

1) Teen Pregnancy Prevention: May is National Teen Pregnancy Prevention
Month and May 1-2 the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy will be
having its first annual board meeting and dinner here in D.C.  On May 2,
the Campaign has also scheduled a Congressional press conference and
policy forum on the Hill with several members.

On Thursday, May 1, we could a) have the President meet at the White House
with the Board of Directors of the Campaign, keep it closed press and
simply have the Campaign update the President on where they are and ask
the President to encourage them to do more; b) have the President speak at
the dinner the evening of May 1, open press, and have an announcement (to
come) to make.

2) DLC Conference: The DLC and Eli have indicated that they want to hold
a welfare to work conference with the NGA, the National Alliance of
Business (NAB), and the White House sometime after the rollout of Eli's
organization. The conference would be focused on best welfare to work
practices and would be geared toward teaching businesses how to hire and
retain welfare recipients.  They would like the President to speak at the
conference.  Presumably, we could ready with a conference in mid or late
May.

Can we get a couple of tentative dates for either of these?
