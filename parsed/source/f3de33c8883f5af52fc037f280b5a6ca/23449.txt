     Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights Event in Philadelphia. Next Friday, you are scheduled
     to participate in a multi-state, multi-state Congressional Democratic event in Philadelphia
     to receive an Internet-based petition calling for the Congress to pass a strong enforceable
     patients' bill of rights. In addition to announcing this petition, which will already have
     thousands of participants and is intended to attract over one million, you can announce the
     OPM "call letter" that will require all participating FEHBP insurers to come into full
     compliance with the patients' bill of rights. Among other provisions this action will ensure
     that every FEHBP plan will have new continuity of care protections. This event, long
     requested by the Democrats, provides you with another opportunity to call on the Congress
     to pass a strong patients' bill of rights and to contrast it with the weak proposal which was
     passed out of the Senate Labor Committee shortly before the recess.

     Response to your request for information on the Medicare annual cap on patient services.
     The $1500 cap on Medicare outpatient physical therapy and other rehabilitative services
     was included as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. We opposed this because of our
     concern about the potential adverse impact on chronically ill beneficiaries. However,
     Congressman Thomas insisted that it be included in the final package. Providers and
     advocates are now arguing that this cap is problematic and a recent study shows that
     almost 13 percent of Medicare beneficiaries exceed the cap each year and are left with
     significant out-of-pocket expenditures. Senator Grassley has proposed legislation to allow
     Medicare beneficiaries to receive services above the cap if they have an illness that will
     clearly require additional services. However, this proposal may prove to be quite costly.
     We are requesting that it be scored and are reviewing alternatives.

     Nationwide Medicare Toll-Free Line. On Thursday, HHS went nationwide on their new
     toll-free telephone line, 1-800 MEDICARE, designed to respond to the numerous questions
     that beneficiaries have about their new options. Callers can talk to a customer service
     representative in English or Spanish to get general information about Medicare; get
     updated information about Medicare health plan options in their community; get specific
     quality and satisfaction information or other complex questions about health care. The
     new toll-free line is part ofthe National Medicare Education Program passed in the
     Balanced Budget Act, a comprehensive effort to help Medicare beneficiaries better
     understand the new health care options that are part of Medicare+Choice.
