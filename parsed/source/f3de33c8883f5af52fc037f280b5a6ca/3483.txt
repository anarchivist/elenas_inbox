TEXT:
Shalala is scheduled to be in Vermont Mon and Tues for quality commission
mtg. w/Gov Dean and Sen Jeffords, back Tues at 5:00pm.  I've asked her
staff to look at whether she could be back early afternoon. Her staff
feel strongly she must be at this event.

Also, HHS has said the earliest they can get me EO is COB today.  I'll
have OMB circulate tomorrow for Friday clearance.  Tight but hopefully
doable time frame.
