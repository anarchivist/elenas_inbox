 TEXT:
 Robert Pear called, seeking data on use of the Welfare to Work tax
 credits.  It sounds like Eli Segal spoke to one of his editors about all
 the Partnerships activities, including the help they provide companies on
 using the tax credits. We're working with Labor and others to get the
 data, but are hoping to steer Robert to a broader story about what
 companies are doing to train and retain former welfare recipients (some
 use tax credits to offset the cost) because any story wholly about the tax
 credits will have to have quotes from critics.

 Robert doesn't seem in a hurry.  We'll get the info together, see how it
 looks, and talk to you first before calling him back.
