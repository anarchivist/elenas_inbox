TEXT:
As I set up the Federal agency group on the summit, I want to make sure we
are on the same wave length on the purpose/process. So here are some
questions:

1. I assume you want Cabinet secretaries to designate a person for the
first meeting, rather than hold the first meeting with the secretaries
themselves. Is that r'ight?   And I assume the kick-off is a memo from you
to Cabinet secretaries asking them to let me know whom they designate. I
will send you a draft for your review if this is right.

2. Do you want to attend the first meeting?      I assume you wouldn't attend
any meetings beyond the first one.

3. I assume the basic purpose of the group is to figure out what agency
commitments are. A baseline question is whether we coordinate our
commitment in some way around a single theme, vs. let the agencies go off
in their chosen directions. I assume the first is preferable, and the
latter is easier. And that Elena and I should talk more about this.

4. Do we invite the Corporation to the meetings? I know it is our
process, not theirs, but they know an awful lot that I don't yet in terms
of answering all of the agencies' questions. Maybe they are invited as
guests as they are needed?     Particularly to the first meeting, to give an
overview of the summit, and answer the agencies' thousands of questions?
(As you can imagine, everyone knows someone who wants to be involved,
everyone wants to attend, and there are a lot of energies to channel in
that regard.) FYI, they are certainly assuming they will be at these
meeting,s - - not that that is any reason for them to come.

5. Elena and I can probably handle this question, but you might want to
be involved. I assume the White House as an organization also needs to
make a commitment and be part of the Federal interagency group. The
question is who frOID-the_Whi.t.e_HO'.lse manages this - - us or someone else.
I have already had!      P6/(b)(6)  JOf the volunteer office vying for this
honor (although their efforts really focus on getting volunteers in here
to help with the mail, which is not exactly the idea).

Finally, FYI, I am in the process of managing the related question of how
to educate all the different parts of the White House about this without
losing control of it. Everyone is calling to say they want to be involved
or think they should playa central role.     Cabinet affairs wants to help
run the interagency proces~; the VP's office is trying to talk


independently to the Corporation about how the summit dovetails with their
community empowerment conference in April; public liaison has all kinds of
ideas.  So that is fun to manage.
