TEXT:
Wanted to share two other thoughts:
As part of the family agenda, it is worth highlighting FMLA expansion
(lowering the threshold to businesses with 25 employees). There is live
interest in the women's community on this and we supported it last year
but it didn't get amplified. would seem like a new initiative.

What's your thinking on whether to include a section on choice? (family
planning increase to lower teen pregnancy or ending violence against
women's health clinics, a goal we all share.)
