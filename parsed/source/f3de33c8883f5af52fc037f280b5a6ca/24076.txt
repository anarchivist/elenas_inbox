TEXT:
Elena,
Thanks for your note.  I think that a decision process on the taxation of
workfare benefits should not pre-judge the outcome, and so I respectfully
disagree with your proposal to limit the process to filling in the details
of how workfare benefits should be non-taxable (for income and FICA
purposes). The DPC/NEC work group is likely to end up with this
conclusion, but I would prefer to hear this issue out (I know Treasury has
done some thinking about the appropriate tax treatment and that some NEC
staffers feel very strongly that workfare benefits should be subject to
income tax, so that recipients can qualify for the EITC).  Personally, my
feeling is that the benefits are akin to welfare (AFDC) benefits and
should be treated the same, but if presented with persuasive evidence to
the contrary, my beliefs could also change.

Is there a problem with seriously looking at this issue anew?
                                        Mark
