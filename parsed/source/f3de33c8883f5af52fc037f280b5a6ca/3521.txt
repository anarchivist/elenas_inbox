    TEXT:
    Attached is a revised submission for the weekly, with a paragraph on
    Texas.   Whether to include it is a judgement call, however, because the
    last major deve10pment with the OCR-initiated desegregation review
    occurred in April.

    Please let me know if you have any questions.

     Civil Rights Investigations of Higher Education in California and Texas

     In response to a complaint filed by several civil rights organizations, the Office for Civil Rights
     (OCR) at the Department of Education will investigate the current admissions policies at the
     three University of California law schools: Boalt Hall, UCLA, and UC-Davis. The investigation
     will detennine whether the policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by having a
     discriminatory impact on minority students. Preliminary analysis shows a significant disparity
     in the admission rate for certain minority group students compared to whites. The investigation
     concerns current admissions policies, rather than the widely-reported decline in minority
     admissions following the discontinuation ofUC's affinnative action program.

     An extensive OCR-initiated investigation ofthe Texas higher education system, begun in
     February, 1997 as part of a series of state higher education desegregation reviews, is continuing.
     The review will detennine, consistent with the Supreme Court's Fordice decision, whether
     vestiges of past discrimination remain in the Texas system. A chapter of the National Black Law
     Students Association filed a complaint with OCR last fall, asserting that Texas continues to
     operate a dual system of higher education and challenging the state's implementation of the
     Hopwood decision. In April, OCR infonned the association that its Title VI allegations would
     be reviewed as a part of the existing investigation, while OCR plans to refer the group's
     Fourteenth Amendment allegations to the Department of Justice.


     Vocational Education Bill

     The Perkins vocational education reauthorization bill, H.R. 1853, should reach a House floor
     vote soon. This week Democrats and Republicans reached a compromise on a within-state
     funding fonnula and other provisions that target more funds to low-income and urban areas, thus
     avoiding a highly partisan vote. The bill would achieve several administration goals, including
     the consolidation of numerous existing set-asides into a flexible state grant. However, serious
     concerns remain, including poor accountability for perfonnance, limits on the use of
     industry-recognized skill standards, and still-inadequate in-state targeting as compared to existing
     law. The Department of Education hopes to address some of these problems in the Senate.
