                             STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

            Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is publishing promising new
    results from the youth anti-smoking program launched by the late Florida Governor
    Lawton Chiles. The study shows that in just one year, smoking has declined by 19 percent
    among middle school students and by 8 percent among high schoolers. These results show
    why every state should have a comprehensive program to reduce youth smoking and why I
    oppose any legislation waiving the federal government's claim to tobacco settlement funds
    without making a commitment from the states to fund such efforts. Without such
    legislation, states won't have to spend a single penny ofthe $246 billion settlement to
    reduce youth smoking. We must act now: every day, 3000 children become regular
    smokers and 1000 will have their lives cut short as a result.

                                              ###
