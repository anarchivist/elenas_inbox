TEXT:
I attended the principals' meeting on Food Safety at USDA today. There
were three basic topics:   (1) reports from public meetings; (2) timing of
the report to the President; and (3) meeting on the Hill scheduled for
Monday.

1.       Reports from public meetings.  The comments in the 6 public meetings
with the growers and the state health departments were pretty favorable.
In fact, it was emphasized that not one of the growers was opposed to the
development. of the gudiance in general. The comments were just that the
timing seemed like it was happening very quickly; that the growers hoped
that they could actively participate and that it would be a bottom-up
process rather than a top-down process; and that, to the extent that we
develop product-specific guidance, that they want to contribute to this
process.   It seems that the concern regarding the product-specific
guidance is addressed adequately, at this initial stage in the process,
in the draft report.

On the international front, there was a public meeting in Washington that
staff of many of the embassies attended. The international community
seems fine with it as well, but, again, they would like to participate and
would like to conduct more research.

One other item that growers asked about was the President's position on
country of origin labeling.

2.      Report to the President. The report on the progress of the development
of the Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) and Good Manufacturing Practices
(GMPs) is due to the President on January 2, 1997.  I am sending you an
outline of the report as well as a draft to fhe report.  It looks like
HHS, FDA, and USDA are on track to get this to the White House by January
2, 1997. However, there were some rumblings that because of holidays,
etc., they might not be able to send over the final draft until January 3
or 4.  I emphasized that they should keep on track for the January 2, and
that is the plan now.  The timing could be emphasized again in the Food
Safety meeting you have scheduled for tomorrow at 5 p.m.

 3.      Hill Briefing. Some Senate staff want a briefing on the entire food
 safety initiative, including the legislation and the guidance. This
.meeting is scheduled for Monday, December 22 at 1 p.m. HHS, USDA, and FDA
 are sending people to the meeting.

Thanks, Mary,
