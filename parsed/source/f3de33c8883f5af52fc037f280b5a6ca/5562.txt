TEXT:
1. We grew the intitiative primarily by adding two programs-- an
expansion of ADR at EEOC from a $4 million pilot program to a $40 million
program over three years and $23 million for the OFCCP program on
compliance.  2. We don't mention the ed survey in the memo but I think it
was on OMB's approved list. We can try and get rid of it.

Have we sent it in? There was a word in the memo   I wanted to delete ...
