Subject:         For Rahm -- Drug Testing

Remember the December 1995 directive to the AG to begin drug testing
offenders as they enter the Federal criminal justice system?

I called Justice today to get an update on the 25 district pilot program.

They told me that 24 of the 25 districts have already agreed to do it
(judges signed off and everything) and that the programs are
up-and-running in around 20 of the districts.

The woman in charge of this implemenation told me that some of the
districts are doing extremely well and she specifically mentioned the
Northern District of Ilinois --- which includes Chicago.  They have a very
high level of consent by the offenders.   This is fascinating - - she also
said that at one point they noticed a large amount of offenders testing
positive for PCP and they were all from the same area of Chicago.  So,
they were able to find out that they had a PCP problem that they didn't
know of before.

Information like this can obviously help you better identify a drug
problem and target your resources to a particular area.

I was thinking that we could ask Justice to draft a report to the
President on the 25 city pilot program and its success and then conclude
that they are going to expand it to every district.  Also, when we are
ready to release it, you could let the Chicago Tribune know about the
success of this Clinton drug initiative in their city and what it is going
to allow us to do in the future.
