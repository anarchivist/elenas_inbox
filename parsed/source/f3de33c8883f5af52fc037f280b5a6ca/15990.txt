TEXT:
1. Mike Cohen met with Bob Chase as a follow-up to your meeting several
weeks ago, specifically to discuss NEA support for the national testing
initiative. At its convention in early July, NEA will first vote to
remove existing policy , adopted during the Bush Administration, which
opposes federal government involvement in developing national tests. This
already has the support of the NEA Board of Directors, and Bob believes
will pass by vote of the delegates. Bob is prepared to move additional
NEA policy that would be favorable to our testing initiative, if, at the
convention, he thinks it will pass.   (The convention will be dealing with
a number of tough reform measures that Bob has been pushing in the past
few months, including the responsibility of NEA members to assume
responsibility for evaluating teachers and removing those who don't
measure up.)   Bob is also prepared to help us build support from state and
local affiliates as we continue to sign up states and local school
districts.   Bob urged that as you and others in the Administration talk
about the tests, we be sure to emphasize the ways in which they can be
tools to help promote learning.
