                            STATEMENT ON THE SIGNING OF H.R. 800,
                         THE EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT

            Today, I am pleased to sign into law H.R. 800, the "Education Flexibility Partnership Act
     of 1999". This bill will enable all the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of
     Puerto Rico, and the Outlying Areas to participate in "ED-Flex" partnerships, a goal that I
     strongly support.
            As States and communities continue the process of implementing education reforms that
     enable all children to achieve to challenging State academic standards, it is important that States
     and school districts have the ability to use resources to meet their particular needs. Although
     current Federal education programs offer a high degree of flexibility, there will always be
     requirements that do not fit the circumstances of each and every school or district. The ED-Flex
     authority gives States the ability to waive requirements that stand in the way of implementing
     reforms, ifthey determine that waivers will promote educational achievement.
            As this measure moved through Congress, my Administration insisted that expanded
     flexibility be accompanied by strong accountability for results.   I am pleased that the final bill
     includes the kind of accountability provisions we sought. It will permit the Secretary of
     Education to grant ED-Flex status only to States that have developed challenging education
     standards as well as assessments for measuring student and district progress against those
                                                                                                      .
     standards, or are on track for doing so. It will also require States to measure the impact of their
     waivers on student performance and the Secretary to terminate a State's ED-Flex status if he
     determines that education performance in the State has not been adequate.
            I am also pleased that the bill would ease requirements related to the participation of
     small school districts in the Class Size Reduction program that this Administration proposed and
     Congress enacted last year. These changes will enable more school districts to take part in this
     important new initiative.
