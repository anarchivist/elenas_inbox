TEXT:
Here's the next move by Philip Morris. After having gotten the reputation
for low
balling its purchase intentions and putting farmers over the barrel,
yesterday
PM makes a public offer (via press release) to buy half of the '97
reserves at
only a 15% discount.  The catch is that, for the first time ever,
they want to cherry pick only the best grades of tobacco.   The result:
they would be getting a much better than 15% discount.  USDA feels they
are being put in a box and are considering a press release to say that
this
offer violates purchase rules.  In any case, USDA says it cannot consider
this
bid until Monday as another offer is open to the companies.
It seems likely there will be moves by the other companies soon.


                     Bid made to buy tobacco
                     reserves / Philip Morris move
                     could boost crops

                     wednesday, December 9, 1998

                     Times-Dispatch Staff Writer

                     Philip Morris USA offered to buy half of the nation's
flue-cured tobacco
                  reserves yesterday, a multimillion-dollar bid that could
help boost farmers'
                  crops in 1999.

                  "It's got to be good news for the farmers," said David
Milby, Philip Morris'
                  senior vice president in charge of tobacco purchasing.
"It allows them to get


                     a better deal."

                  Milby would not disclose the value of Philip Morris'
offer to buy 95 million
                  pounds of the heat-treated tobacco. Industry sources
placed its value at
                  about $190 million.

                     Milby would say only that Philip Morris would pay more
than an earlier
                     price set by flue-cured tobacco officials.

                     The reserves eyed by Philip Morris, the nation's No.1
cigarette maker,
                     make up more than half of the 181.8 million pounds of
leaf put in the
                     farmers' co-op after it did not sell at auction last
year.

                     Flue-cured tobacco, named for the process of sending hot
air through flues
                  in curing barns, is Virginia's leading cash crop, with
sales of $163.9 million in
                 1997.

                     Reserve levels of the leaf are crucial in determining
how much tobacco
                     farmers can grow each year. Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman will
                     announce the 1999 tobacco quota Tuesday.

                    Philip Morris and three other major cigarette-makers
drew farmers'   ire last
                    week by announcing plans to

                     buy 28 percent less flue-cured leaf next year.

                     At that level, farmers would have to cut back their
crops by about 30
                     percent -- marking the second straight year of deep
cuts.

                   Yesterday's news may help Philip Morris' standing in the
tobacco fields and
                  was applauded by Sen. Charles S. Robb, D-Va.

                     "I appreciate the effort that is being made to address
the drastic quota
                     reductions that face growers and their communities in
the coming season,
                  although I continue to be concerned about the uncertaint
y they face over the
                  long run," Robb said in a statement.

                     Flue-cured officials were studying Philip Morris' offer
last night.

                  "On the surface, it's at a more favorable price," said
Arnold Hamm, assistant
                  general manager of the Flue-Cured Stabilization Corp.,


the farmer-run group
                  in Raleigh, N.C.,   that handles surplus leaf.

                  But Hamm said the offer could run afoul of the
government's strict rules for
                  selling reserve tobacco.

                   "We cannot cut a deal with Philip Morris,· he said.

                   The three other major tobacco companies -- R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. ,
                   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. and Lorillard Tobacco
Co. -- must be
                   given a fair chance to buy the same reserves, he said.

                  However, Hamm said,   "The fact that Philip Morris is
responding is positive."

                   The other cigarette companies made no comment yesterday.

                   "Now the challenge is on the other companies to step up
to the plate and
                  take their share" of the tobacco reserves, said J.T.
Davis of the Concerned
                  Friends for Tobacco, a Danville-based farmers' group.

                  For now, he said,   "The tobacco farm community can
breathe a little easier."
