TEXT:
More good news on child care in the context of the Republican budget
resolution.   Yesterday, when the conferees were appointed, Senator Dodd
offerred a motion to instruct the conferees on his child care amendment
for an increase of $12.5 billion over 10 years in child care funding.    The
vote passed, 66-33. As of last night, the final conference report
included specific language directing $6 billion over 10 years in new money
for child care (the conferees cut in half Dodd's figure, but it's still a
big victory).  I'll include an item in the weekly report.
