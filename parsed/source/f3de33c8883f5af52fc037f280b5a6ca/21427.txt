PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
REMARKS ON PENDING LEGISLATION
THE WHITE HOUSE
October 5, 1998

        This is a moment of great promise for America. Our hard work is
bearing remarkable results, from the health of our economy to the strength
and safety of our communities. At the same time, we can see important
challenges ahead; and we know that our nation will not be everything it
can be unless we rise to meet those challenges.

        It is now eleven months since I sent Congress a budget, and five
months since the legal deadline for Congress to pass a budget.  Now
Congress has sent me only [one] of thirteen appropriations bills necessary
to keep the government running.  On Friday, the temporary spending measure
I signed will run out.

        Today, I stand with Representative Gephardt and Senator Daschle to
call on the congressional majority: Time in this session is growing short,
and Congress has important work left to do: Pass the necessary spending
bills to keep the government running.  Save Social Security for future
generations.  Ensure a quality education for all our children.  Protect
America from global economic turmoil. These are the priorities of the
American people, and they must be the priorities of the Congress in the
last days of thi~ legislative session.


         First, we must save Social Security first.  Last week, I was privileged
to announce an historic achievement: for the first time in a generation,
America has a budget surplus. We have restored order and discipline to
our fiscal house.   Just as important, we have shown what Americans can do
when we place progress above partisanship, and common sense above
conflict. Congress must not lose that spirit in a rush to spend the
surplus.   I have proposed tax cuts that are fully paid for.  But if the
Congress sends me a tax plan that drains billions from the surplus before
saving Social Security first, I will veto it. We have worked too hard for
too long to abandon fiscal discipline and weaken Social Security in the
weeks before an election.

        Second, we must act to protect our prosperity in the turbulent
international economy. Recent events remind us that America cannot remain
an island of prosperity in a sea of distress. Quite simply:.America must
lead.  But if we are to do so, if we are to contain the contagion that
spreads so quickly from one country to another, America must meet its
obligations to the International Monetary Fund. The global financial
leaders meeting here in Washington have made clear there is support for
strong action to manage the growing crisis. The world is waiting for the
Congress to step up to its responsibility, provide funds to the IMF, and
help pull teetering economies away from the brink.

         Third, we must continue to invest in education. Just as we have brought
order to our fiscal house, we must bring order and learning to the
schoolhouse.   For the sake of our children, Congress must once again put
partisanship aside, if only for one day, to transform education in
America.   In one day, Congress can -- and must -- pass a plan to provide
AmericaO,s public schools with the tools they need: 100,000 well-qualified
new teachers to reduce class size, after-school and summer school programs
to help students rise to higher academic standards, and modernized schools
for the 21st century.   Our children deserve at least one full day of
concentrated congressional action, not another week or month of delay.

        Fourth, Congress must act to protect -- not to gut -- environmental
protections.  Yet Republicans in Congress have sought to slip unacceptable
provisions into unrelated bills that would cripple wildlife protection,
build a road through an Alaskan wildlife refuge, force overcutting of our
national forest, deny taxpayers a fair return on oil leasing, and thwart
common sense efforts to address global warming. These are little more
than backdoor attempts to weaken our environmental laws.  And if they
insist on sending these anti-environment riders to my desk, I will veto
them.

        These are the tasks before the Congress. They demand attention,
and they demand action.  As Congress completes its work, I will continue
to do everything in my power to elevate progress over partisanship, and to
demand that the priorities of the American people become the priorities of
the united States Congress. Thank you.
