TEXT:
Barry Toiv jsut called and asked for some Q&A on bilingual ed for Mike's
1:00 briefing, He things there's a chance this will come up today.

Here is what I've done.  I'll call/page you in the hope you'll have a
chance to review before the deadline.

Bilingual Education


Q,         What is the PresidentO,s view of bilingual education?

A.       The President believes is is critical for all students to learn
English. At present, there are approximately 3.2 million students who are
not yet proficient in English, and they need extra help.   The President
supports bilingual education programs that help immigrant students and
other students whose native language is not English, become proficient in
English.

The President strongly supports the federal Bilingual Education program,
because it provides local communities with the funds they need to provide
extra help to students with limited English proficiency, while leaving the
decision about how best to provide that help to each local school system.
In his FY99 budget, the President called for a 17 percent increase -- $33
million -- in the Federal bilingual education program. These funds would
help train 20,000 teachers over five years to more effectively teach
English in the context of high academic standards.

The President has strongly opposed the provision in the House supplemental
appropriations bill that would cut funding for the bilingual education
program.

Q.      What is the PresidentO,s view of the DeLay bill that would
eliminate the Federal Bilingual education program.

A.      The President is opposed to this bill or any other bill that
would wipe out the funds needed to give students they help they need to
learn English. with nearly 20% of the children in our schools immigrants
or the children of immigrants, we should be strengthening our efforts to
help students learn English, not ending them.

Q.      What is the PresidentO,s view of the Riggs bill that would end
funding for bilingual education programs that donO,t teach kids English


within 2 years?

A.      This bill was recently introduced and is being reviewed by the
Education Department and the Domestic Policy Council.   The review has not
been completed, and the matter has not been brought to the PresidentD,s
attention yet.

Q.      The President is traveling to California next week, where the
Unz Initiative to end bilingual education will be voted on in June. What
is the President'l,s position on the Unz Initiative?

A.      The President has not announced his views on Unz, though I
suspect that you will be hearing from the President or Secretary Riley on
this issue in the near future.  If so, you will know the AdrninistrationU,s
position at that time, and not before.
