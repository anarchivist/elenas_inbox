HEADLINE: Chairman Demands Tobacco Documents

BYLINE: LAURIE KELLMAN
AP-Tobacco ,0535

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:
    The chairman of the House Commerce Committee subpoenaed 39,000 tobacco
industry documents he said may contain information about the cigarette-makers'
marketing and research practices.

   The chairman, Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., once among Congress' staunchest
defenders of the industry, demanded the documents by March 12.

  "Congress and the American people deserve to know what's in the documents so
we can make informed decision about tobacco policy," Bliley said in a statement
Thursday.

   Industry spokesman Scott Williams confirmed that the subpoenas had been
received by Geoffrey Bible of Philip Morris, Steven Goldstone ofRJR Nabisco,
Nicholas Brookes of Brown & Williamson, Laurence Tisch of the Loews Corp.,
Samuel Chilcote of the Tobacco Institute and James Glenn of the Council for
Tobacco Research.

   The subpoenas stem from documents Minnesota courts have ordered released to
the state and to Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which are suing the tobacco
industry to recover $1.77 billion spent treating smoking-related illnesses in
Minnesota. Williams said the industry is appealing the order. He declined to
comment further.

   "I've said all along that if more documents were identified in the Minnesota
case as possibly containing evidence of crime or fraud that I would request
them," Bliley said. "More documents have been identified, and these documents
must see the light of day."
"will help call the tobacco industry's bluff."

   "While the tobacco CEOs testify in Congress that it's a new day and the
industry is coming clean with the truth, they are fighting tooth and nail and
spending millions of dollars to continue to conceal secret documents in the
Minnesota case," Humphrey asserted.

    The subpoenas come as Congress decides whether to ratify or rewrite the
landmark tobacco settlement reached in June between state attorneys general
and the industry. The deal would end 40 state lawsuits if companies pay $368
billion over 25 years and agree to curb some business practices, such as
marketing.

   In exchange the industry would get protection from most lawsuits.

  Congressional response to the latter requirement has been cool, and
Republican leaders have not made passing a bill a top priority.

   At a meeting of the Consumer Analysts Group of New York on Wednesday,
Goldstone of RJR Nabisco told journalists that if Congress does not pass the
settlement by June, "then the chances for (passage) this year begin to
diminish."

   Goldstone said upcoming elections would distract lawmakers from the complex
decisions required by the agreement.
