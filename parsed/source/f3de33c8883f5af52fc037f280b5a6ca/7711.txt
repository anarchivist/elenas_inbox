                         Race, Crime, and the Administration of Justice

This May Advisory Board meeting provides an opportunity to explore several questions related to
race, crime, and the administration of justice: What are the facts? How do different perceptions of
crime and the administration of justice affect efforts to build One America? What strategies can
help promote a criminal justice system that serves and treats Americans of all races fully and
equally? The purpose of the meeting is to lay a foundation for the prior and future work of the
Advisory Board in this area. We encourage the submission of written comments on these issues
following the meeting.
