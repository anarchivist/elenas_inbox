     Elena,
     INS has received some press calls (most notably from the Washington Times)
     to respond to the protest that took place in front of the WH by those who
     are upset at being cut-off of work authorizations and stays of removal by
     the 9th Circuit's Section 377 decision, Attached is a draft q&a for their
     use.   Please let me know if this looks o.k. Thanks.

              Q:   What is the INS doing to provide relief to the thousands who, because of Section 377 of
                   the INA, are in danger of being deported?

              A:   The INS is aware of the issues surrounding those who were members of the CSS, LULAC
                   and Zambrano classes who are now ineligible for immigration benefits (such as work
                   authorization and stays of removal). Current immigration law may provide some avenue
                   for relief for CSS class members. Those who have been in the country for more than 10
                   years may be eligible for can(;ellation of removal under IIRTRA. Because ofthe
                   continued pendency of litigation in both the LULAC and Zambrano cases, we cannot
                   comment on possible outcomes there.
