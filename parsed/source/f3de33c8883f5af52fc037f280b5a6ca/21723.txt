A thought. Once we get final clearance on FICA, we must talk about
timing.  I don't want to just drop this.  I want to time it with some bad
budget news the states will be getting. (Conversly, I REALLY need this
when some of the bad budget news does hit in a couple of weeks so PLEASE
let's continue to press ahead so it is in our pocket).
