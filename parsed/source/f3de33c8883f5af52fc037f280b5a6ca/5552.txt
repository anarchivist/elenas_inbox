New education/prevention initiative on heart disease. This campaign would
provide information to health providers and communities on heart disease
prevention targeted particularly to minorities such as the importance of
keeping blood pressure under control, checking cholesterol, understanding
the risks based on family background, and strategies to prevent tobacco
use. It could build on models such as O&Search Your Heart08-- a
church-based heart health program for African-Americans run by the
American Heart Association) and other strategies to target local
communities around the nation.

Building on the new National Diabetes Education Program at the CDC, a
national information and outreach campaign could target health care
providers, particularly those that serve in minority communities,-medical
schools, and the public, through community-based initiatives to provide
education to help identify people at risk for diabetes and provide
interventions, such as glucose monitoring and nutrition and excerise
guidelines to reduce their risks for this disease.  It could also provide
those with diabetes information about reducing the risks for some of the
devastating side effects of this disease, such as blindness and amputation
by increasing awareness about the new Medicare benefit and the importance
of regular blood monitoring
