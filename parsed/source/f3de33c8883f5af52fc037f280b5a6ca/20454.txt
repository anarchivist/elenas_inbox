    TEXT:
    This Friday, in conjunction with his trip to Texas, the VP will host a
    town-hall meeting in San Antonio with local affiliates of his welfare to
    work coalition.   The meeting is scheduled from 11:30-12:30 at the YMCA in
    San Antonio.  Apparently "the decision to do this was made Friday, but VP's
    office forgot to let us know--I only found out this morning.   This evolved
    from the VP simply doing a tarmac announcement of Texas' Welfare-to-Work
    formula grant, to doing something wi"th John Sharp/Pathfinders (not avai
    lable), to doing a coalition meeting. The VP will announce that DOL is
    releasing Texas's grant ($76 million, the largest grant released to
    date).  Secretary Herman may be attending (not confirmed).   The plan is
    for her to notify the Governor and congressional delegation just before
    the event--so we don't get scooped.   The VP will be joined by the director
    of the local YMCA and a former welfare recipient (probably someone whose
    child is in after-school program at the Boys and Girls Club). Audience of
    150-200 will primarily be people from the local community-based
    organizations (YMCA, YWCA, Goodwill, United Way, Salvation Army,
    Pathfinders, etc). VP will calion selected audience members to talk
    about what theY're doing to promote retention for welfare recipients, i.e.
    mentoring, child care, etc.

    Since San Antonio is one of the cities in the Partnership's eight-city
    campaign with the Enterprise Foundation, I've hooked Partnership into the"
    event.  They'll round up a few businesses to attend, one of whom the VP
    can calion. The local Enterprise Foundation contact, and Partnership
    staff will also attend.  I've also made sure HHS and SBA are in the loop.

    I've given Lee Anne Brackett all the recent welfare reform Q&As, relevant


          background material, and some suggestions for things to highlight in VP
          remarks, and will review remarks and press release.
