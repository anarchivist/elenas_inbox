TEXT:
Barry White walked a few of us through the welfare entitlement issues in
the budget. Here are a few key items:

They are wondering whether to propose any more legal immigrant benefit
restorations, and what piece of the remaining cuts would be the best
candidate for restoration.   Ideas were food stamps for children, (either
all or just those who were here when the law was signed) and additional
SSI restorations. They didn't have a position on this yet.
USDA wants $4billion for a new proposal ("Children's Hunger Initiative for
Learning and Development"), an expansion of school breakfast for families
with income over 185% of poverty. OMB was quite negative on this, arguing
there is no link between this investment and any outcome.
They mentioned the work we are doing on child support systems
requirements/penalties that would have budget implications.
They might put a legislative proposal in the budget to ensure that we
don't lose child support collections due to the TANF separate state
programs· problem. They raised the possibility that, depending on the
outcome of the TANF reg discussion, we could add in work requirements for
separate state programs.
They are concerned that Congress may want to raid welfare research funds
for other purposes, and said we need a strategy to defend these dollars.

There were several smaller items I can go over with Cynthia. Since Jen
~lein wasn't there, I believe they plan to meet again to discuss child
care.
