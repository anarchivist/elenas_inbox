TEXT:
Liability Provisions

Generally, it will be difficult to amend the liability provisions, without
making changes that either favor the industry or give them an excuse to
stay away from the negotiations. However, if we were to revise the
provisions we would probably want to raise the cap from $6.5 billion,
perhaps to $8 billion contained in the Harkin-Chafee bill. We also plan
to look into the possibility of changing the percentage contributed by
individual companies versus the industry (McCain has $5.2 billion
contributed by the industry, with a $1.3 billion copayment by the
companies; Senator HarkinD,s bill has a $4 billion/$4 billion split).
Also, we would probably want to change the procedureal provisions related
to denying the liability cap to companies missing the youth lookback
penalties by more than 20 percentage points; currently, companies would
benefit from the cap even if they missed the youth lookback target by 20
percentage points only if the company also failed to comply with the Act
or took action to undermine the achievement of youth smoking reductions.
