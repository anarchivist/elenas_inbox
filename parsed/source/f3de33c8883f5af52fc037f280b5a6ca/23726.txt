TEXT:
is requesting 15-20 minutes on the phone with the President for a Monday
a.m. piece on the strategy session.    Bruce, I've. also let him know you're
the guy in charge, so he'll be pursuing you for information -- I've
already told him about all I thought was prudent to tell him -- no names
yet -- but one thing I've made clear to him was that this is not just
about Hollywood, nor, to the extent it is about Hollywood, is it about
beating them up.   (His original pitch was that the L.A. Times was a good
opportunity for POTUS to send his message to Hollywood, and I expect that
he will broaden his pitch a little as he moves around trying to get the
interview.)  Anyway, let's put this on the list as something to consider.
We could do it as late as the weekend, although I don't now if the Pres.
would be ready for this even then.
