TEXT:
You either have received or will soon receive Ward's latest dispatch.  The
preliminary recommendation for how to proceed is to go with the letter
that was recently circulated by Presidential Correspondence (response to
Connerly I) with a few modifications.

What say you? Please send comments bye-mail ASAP so that we can get it
out to our friend.

Thanks.
