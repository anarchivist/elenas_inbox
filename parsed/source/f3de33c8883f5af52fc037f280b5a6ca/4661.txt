      TEXT:
      Immigration Review Plan:

      what:
      Our review process should look into four things: 1) Commission's proposal;
      2) INS's reform proposal; 3) Rep. Reyes' bill; and 4) ONDCP border
      proposal.

      How:
      Before we start meetings, I will pull together a document briefly
      summarizing the proposals and laying out some of the issues. We can
      distribute this memo internally to the interested WH offices.  Since the
      review process strikes at the heart of institutional "turf", it would
      probably be wise do an initial round of meetings with the affected
      agencies separately to discuss the proposals that would specifically
      impact their functions. We should have a list of questions that they
      should be prepared to answer at the meetings (e.g, feasibility, costs of
      proposals). We may need to meet with INS/DOJ twice, once to get briefed
      on their internal proposal and a second to get their feedback on other
      proposals.   These meetings should begin next week.

      Once we've heard from all the agencies, we will need to internally decide
      which option or combination of options we prefer. Then we should have an
      interagency meeting to discuss our preferred options and gauge the
      agencies' reactions.

      Timetable:
      Our internal goal should be to try to finish the process by the end of the
      calendar year.  This would allow us to use the FY 99 budget as a vehicle
      if we choose. Since this will be fast upon us, I would like to shoot for
      one meeting per week, beginning October 13. As a goodwill gesture, I
      think INS/DOJ should be our first meeting.

      Proposed internal timetable:
      Oct. 13-- INS/DOJ
      Oct. 20- State
      Oct. 27- Labor
      Nov. 3- INS/DOJ
      Nov. 10- internal WH meeting
      Nov. 17- interagency meeting

      This timetable is probably a little ambitious, but as early as possible,
      we need to have a sense of what things should be linked to the budget


 process (and ready by early December). The timing of the budget process
 may preclude certain dramatic changes-- and we should keep that in mind.
 While I think it is a useful concrete timeline for us,  if we want to
 ultimately support something early next year, I think we should be able to
 do that as well.

 External timetable: We should inform agencies that we plan on meeting
 with all of them this month and into next month, with an interagency
 meeting planned for mid-November.  I think we should let them know that we
 are mindful of the '99 budget timetable, but that it will not dictate the
 final outcome either.

 Let me know what you think of this plan, or if you have any other ideas as
 to how we should do this. 'Thanks.
