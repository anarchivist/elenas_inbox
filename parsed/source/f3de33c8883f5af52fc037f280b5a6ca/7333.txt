Subject:         The full story

Tobacco Investigation, 1st Add, a0632,250
WASHINGTON: tobacco products

    Liggett also agreed to describe for prosecutors the control of
research by the Council for Tobacco Research, including special
projects conducted under the council's auspices, and the
involvement of lawyers in directing research or crafting false or
misleading statements by any of the tobacco companies to Congress,
the Food & Drug Administration and American consumers.
    The company agreed to help prosecutors obtain relevant evidence,
including evidence of crimes and fraud contained in documents the
tobacco companies continue to refuse to disclose on grounds of
attorney-client or attorney-work product privileges.
    In February, a source familiar with the investigation had said
that Liggett was offering to make its scientists and other experts
available to the government for use in its three-year-old
investigation.
    Among the allegations the department is probing is whether
industry officials lied to Congress in 1996 when they testified to
having no knowledge of nicotine's addictive qualities or adverse
health affects from smoking and whether they submitted false data
to the FDA.
    Liggett, which is owned by Brooke Group Ltd. and markets L&M,
Chesterfield, Eve and Lark cigarettes in the United States, broke
with bigger companies last year in reaching an earlier settlement
with 22 states that sued the industry to recover Medicaid funds
spent on treating smokers.
    It also was the first company to list ingredients on its


cigarette packs.
