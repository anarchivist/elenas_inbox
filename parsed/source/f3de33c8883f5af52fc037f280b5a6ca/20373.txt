Today's survey released by PRIDE is the third study since last summer indicating that younger
students are getting the message on the dangers of drugs. While this news is encouraging, we
must not let up the fight to protect our children from drugs. That is why in the coming months,
we will take our anti-drug media campaign nationwide, fund more community anti-drug
coalitions and work to enact our long-term drug strategy. And we will do everything else we
can to reach our ultimate goal -- cutting teen drug use in half.
