Aging Foster Kids,510
GOP backing bill to aid aging foster kids

     WASHINGTON (AP)   Republican leaders are promising a vote by
next month on legislation to help some of the 20,000 foster
children abruptly dropped from state care when they turn 18.
     The bipartisan bill is being introduced in the House on
Thursday, where it will get high-powered backing from Rep. Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, the GOP whip and a foster father.
     The bill, which would cost about $500 million over five years,
would double funding for a program that helps these young adults
make the transition to independence. It would also allow states to
extend Medicaid to them through age 21. The package is similar to
one proposed by President Clinton in his budget.
     "These kids really have been woefully neglected,"   said Rep.
Nancy Johnson, R-Conn. "The money's never been there."
     Johnson, who chairs the Ways and Means human resources
subcommittee, said GOP leaders have promised a vote in June. The
legislation is expected to clear the Ways and Means Committee by
the end of May. DeLay, along with experts in the field, will
testify at a subcommittee hearing Thursday.
     Abused and neglected children who are removed from their
parents' care are supported with government money until they turn
18. Federal and state dollars pay for their expenses in foster
homes, treatments in group facilities and medical care.
     But that support ends at age 18   even when they have not
finished high school and no matter how prepared they are to enter
the world.
     Congressional Republicans are generally hostile to new social
spending    particularly spending measured in the hundreds of
millions of dollars. But, like other efforts to improve the
adoption and foster care system, this measure appears to have


bipartisan backing.
    Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Department of Health and
Human Services, noted that congressional Republicans have opposed
other administration requests for increased domestic spending.
    "We have a track record on child welfare where there's been
bipartisan support, " Kharfen said.
    The legislation being introduced by Johnson and Rep. Ben Cardin,
D-Md., would:
     Double funding for the Independent Living Program, which
teaches foster kids life skills such as how to plan a budget or
look for an apartment. The $70 million program would grow to $140
million per year, and states could, for the first time, use some of
this money to help the young adults pay for housing.
     Allow states to extend Medicaid to these young people. The
administration proposed mandatory Medicaid for them, but House
experts said that would be too expensive    about $400 million over
five years. Instead, the House bill. would allow states to extend
the coverage if they want to, which could cost $200 million.
     Tighten rules in the Supplemental Security Income program,
which serves poor Americans with disabilities. This is expected to
save money that could be used for the foster child program.
     Make minor changes in reimbursement rates to state child
support programs, saving additional dollars.
