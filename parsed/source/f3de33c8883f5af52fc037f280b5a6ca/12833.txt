The Honorable Ted Stevens
Chainnan
Committee on Appropriations
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chainnan:

         This letter is to advise you about Census and other appropriations requests that will be
transmitted shortly. On January 25, 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that statistical sampling
could not be used in Census 2000 to detennine the population counts for purposes of
reapportioning Congressional seats. Therefore, additional funds are needed for non-sampling
activities in the decennial census.

         Shortly, the President will transmit to the Congress a budget amendment for fiscal year
2000 totaling $1,723,000,000, bringing the total request for Periodic Censuses and Programs of
the Bureau of the Census to $4,637,754,000. The request will be accompanied by proposed
offsets.

        This amendment will provide funds for field data collection and infrastructure; coverage
improvement operations; the telephone questionnaire assistance program; and, advertising and
promotion efforts. Specifically, the temporary field staff associated with the increased workload
will now peak at 860,000. Additional staff, equipment, and space are necessary for the 520
Local Census Offices and 12 regional census centers. The funds that will be requested in this
amendment will provide the resources necessary to conduct non-response follow-up at an
additional 16 million housing units, an increase of 50 percent over the previous census design.
In addition, field work for non-response follow-up will take 10 weeks to complete, four weeks
more than expected in the previous census design.      Funds will also be requested for
infonnation technology support in the four data capture centers to handle the increased
processing volume, and for additional promotion and advertising efforts associated with this
massive statistical operation.

         The transmittal will also contain additional requests, including funding for embassy
security and Commerce Department Pacific Coastal Salmon recovery, as well as appropriate
offsets.

                                              Sincerely,


Jacob J. Lew

Director
                                                                Hex-Dwnp Conversion

(In the appropriations language under the above heading, delete "$2,789,545,000" and substitute

This proposal would increase FY 2000 outlays by $1,447 million.
