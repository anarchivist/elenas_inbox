MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                         Jack Gibbons
                              Assistant to the President for Science and Technology

                              Elena Kagan
                              Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:                      Cloning Policy Decisions

This memo summarizes the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) cloning report
and the cloning legislation you will announce Monday. It also discusses three decisions about
the legislation we would like you to focus on: (I) whether to prohibit the production of embryos
(as well as human beings) through cloning; and (2) whether to sunset the prohibition on cloning
after 5 years; (3) and whether to use NBAC's precise definition of cloning in the legislation.

NBAC's Findings and Recommendations

In its final report NBAC states that it is morally unacceptable for anyone to attempt to create a
child using the technology that created Dolly the sheep (so-called somatic cell nuclear transfer
technology). NBAC also concludes that the cloning of DNA, cells, and tissues (which do not
involve the creation of entire human beings), and the cloning of animals, are scientifically
important and not ethically problematic. NBAC calls for:

       Carefully-worded legislation that prohibits somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child
       (without impeding important cloning research on DNA, cells, and animals), sunsets in 3-5
       years, and provides for further review by an advisory body prior to the sunset date;
       Continuing your moratorium on the use of federal funds for cloning human beings;
       calling on all scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary moratorium; and
       working with other countries to enforce common aspects of cloning restrictions.

Proposed Legislation

The legislation you will announce tomorrow::

       Prohibits the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer with the intent of introducing the product
       into a woman's womb or in any other way creating a human being;
       Gives the Attorney General authority to seek injunctive relief, impose civil fines up to
       $250,000 or twice the profit from a violation of the Act (whichever is. greater), and seize
       property used in violating the Act;
       Sunsets the prohibition on cloning 5 years from the date of enactment; and
       Directs the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to report to you prior to the sunset
       date on the advisability of continuing the prohibition.
                                                                        Automated Records Management SystelT'
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

    Key Legislative Issues

    1. Embryo Research

    NBAC's proposed legislation -- and your draft bill -- would not ban the creation of cloned
    embryos for research purposes. NBAC simply did not evaluate the ethics of this activity.
    NBAC declined to speak to the issue because a 1994 NIH panel has already evaluated embryo
    research ethics, and because using somatic cell nuclear transfer to create embryos for research
    does not pose distinct ethical questions. Consequently, the Commission focused its attention on
    the use of such techniques for the purpose of creating an embryo which would then be implanted
    in a woman's uterus and brought to term. The unique and distinctive ethical issues raised by the
    use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create children relate to, for example, serious safety
    concerns, individuality, family integrity, and treating children as objects.

    You have already acted to restrict embryo research. In 1994 you banned the use of NIH funds to
    create embryos for research purposes (the NIH panel had recommended permitting the funding of
    certain limited research on embryos in the first 14 days after fertilization), and Congress has
    similarly prohibited the use ofHHS funds. But privately-funded embryo research is not
    restricted.

    The right-to-life community has already criticized NBAC for not recommending a ban on
    creating cloned embryos. Still, we recommend against your prohibiting this activity in the
    legislation you announce Monday. There is no moral rationale for treating embryos created
    through cloning differently from embryos developed through other means (e.g. in vitro
    fertilization). Prohibiting the creation of embryos for research using private funds could halt
    important research on infertility and possibly other medical conditions and would be strongly
    opposed by the scientific and fertility communities. In short, it is a controversial step that
    merits further consideration. Therefore, we suggest you limit the scope of the legislation to the
    issue the Commission addressed. If asked about your position on embryo research, you could
    note that it is an important but separate question and reiterate your position that no federal funds
    should be used to create embryos for research purposes.

    2.     Sunset Provision

    NBAC states strongly that any legislative prohibition on cloning include a sunset clause to ensure
    that Congress review the issue after a specified period of time. Commissioners who oppose
    cloning because of safety concerns alone insist on a time-limited ban because time may mitigate
    such concerns. But those who think cloning is.inherently morally wrong also support a
    time-limited ban because (1) there has been so little time to fully consider the moral issues and it
    is possible their position may evolve; (2) the sunset provision provides a strong incentive for
    Congress and the Administration to renew the national debate on cloning within several years,
    ensuring continued attention to the ethical questions; and (3) there is a high probability that
    Congress will simply get the legislative language wrong the first time around, given our limited
    understanding of the science, the difficulty of defining terms, and the vagaries of the legislative
    process.

                                                                       Automated Records ManaC1cment SystelT'
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

    Some will argue that a time-limited prohibition is inconsistent with the view that,
    notwithstanding safety concerns, cloning is inherently wrong because of its psychological social,
    or religious implications. Given your previously expressed views on this issue, if you propose a
    sunset provision you may face that criticism.

    You could propose legislation that provides for review by NBAC in 4 Y:z years but does not
    sunset the ban. This approach would shift the burden of proof to those who want to lift the ban,
    since Congress would have to act affirmatively to affect change. Jack Gibbons and Harold
    Varmus oppose this modification to your draft legislation. The Vice President prefers this
    modified approach.
