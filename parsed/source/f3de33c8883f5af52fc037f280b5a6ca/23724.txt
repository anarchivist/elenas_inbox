     THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT OF 1965
                 Section-by-Section Analysis
                       TITLE XI--PART G

     Sec. 1110 (ED-Flex Partnerships).  Section 1110 of the
bill would make minor revisions to the recently enacted
Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 and
redesignate it as Part G of Title XI of the revised ESEA.

     Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of section 1110(a)
would make minor changes to the short title, findings, and
definitions of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of
1999 to reflect its incorporation into the ESEA.

     Paragraph (5) of section 1110(a) would, in addition to
making minor editorial revisions, make State eligibility
for ED-Flex status turn, in part, not on compliance with
various accountability requirements under Title I of the
ESEA, but on whether the State has an approved
accountability plan under proposed new section 11208 of the
ESEA and is making satisfactory progress, as determined by
the Secretary, in implementing its policies under proposed
new sections 11204 (Student Progress and Promotion Policy)
and 11205 (Ensuring Teacher Quality) of the ESEA.
Paragraph (5) would also revise the conditions under which
the Secretary may grant an extension of ED-Flex authority,
beyond five years, to provide, in part, that the Secretary
may grant such an extension only if he or she determines
that the State has made significant statewide gains in
student achievement and is closing the achievement gap
between low- and high-performing students.

     In addition, paragraph (5) of section 1110(a) of the
bill would revise the list of Federal education programs
that are subject to ED-Flex authority to reflect the
amendments that would be made to the ESEA by the bill and
to include Title VII of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless
Assistance Act.  Paragraph (5) would also clarify that,
while States may grant waivers with respect to the minimum
percentage of children from low-income families needed to
permit a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the ESEA,
in doing so they may not go below 40 percent.  Finally,
paragraph (5) would add a transition provision that makes
clear that waivers granted under applicable ED-Flex
authority prior to the effective date of the new Part G of
Title XI would remain in effect in accordance with the
terms and conditions that applied when those waivers were
                                              Hex-Dump CQflVif§iilft .

granted, and that waivers granted on or after the effective
date of Part G would be subject to the provisions of Part
G.

     Paragraphs (6) and (7) of section 1110(a) of the bill
would make editorial revisions and repeal, as no longer
needed, certain amendatory provisions to other Acts (but
