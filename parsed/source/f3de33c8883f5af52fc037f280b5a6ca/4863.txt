TEXT:
On Thursday HHS released that the Medicare premium will stay at the 1997
rate of $43.80. This is the first time in over ten years that the premium
has not gone up. Last year it rose by $1.30.   The Part A deductible is
only rising by $4 to $764. This small increase largely reflects savings
from a freeze on Medicare hospital payments and other strucutural changes
in the Balanced Budget Act.
