TEXT:
H.R. 1072 would establish a commission to investigate the policies and
procedures of the military justice system with respect to the
investigation of reports of sexual misconduct, sexual harassment, and
unlawful gender discrimination.

In its report, circulated on May 22, 1997 under LRM RJN 84, the DOD
contends that the bill is unnecessary.  The Uniform Code of Military
Justice already provides a sophisticated statutory scheme, complete with
sufficient safeguards to ensure that complaints of sexual misconduct,
sexual harassment, and gender discrimination are thoroughly investigated
and fairly resolved.

The Justice Department feels that the tone of the report is defensive but
offers no objection from a legal standpoint.  The EEOC and OPM had no
comment on the DOD report,  while the NSC concurred with Defense.  OMB has
no objection to the report, and this Office plans to clear it by cob
Tuesday

Please advise if WH Counselor OPD have any comments on the draft report
by Tuesday, June 10, 1997.

Thank you.
