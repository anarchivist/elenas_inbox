TEXT:
Education Department will send its final draft of the bilingual bill over
today for OMB review process-earlier draft was in decent but not great
shape.  I will set up a meeting to review the ED draft tomorrow morning.
We will either be ready to transmit by COB Friday, or, more likely Monday.

Where are we on sending a decision memo to POTUS?
