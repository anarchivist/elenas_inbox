The Honorable Maxine Waters
Chairwoman
Congressional Black Caucus
2344 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Ms. Waters:

I appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and the entire Congressional Black Caucus (CBC)
earlier this week. I believe that it is extremely important for this Administration to maintain
strong lines of communication with the CBC. The President and I are committed to working
with you to advance policies which are beneficial to the African-American community.

As you recall, a number of questions were raised on a wide range of topics at our meeting. As I
promised, I have attached answers to the questions which were left outstanding at the end of our
meeting. In addition, I have attached a budget agreement fact sheet on areas of the budget of
particular interest to you and your CBC colleagues. I hope that this information is helpful. I
look forward to your upcoming meeting with the President and working closely with you in the
future.

Sincerely,



Erskine Bowles

                                                         Automated Records Management SystelTl
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
still award states with federal contract dollars even if the state is not implementing
affirmative action programs, etc.?

The President has stated his opposition to state referenda which abolish affirmative action at the
state level, and, in keeping with this position, the Justice Department has joined in the challenge
to Prop 209 in California. The U.S. is a party to the case as amicus curiae and had argued
forcefully at the Preliminary Injunction stage that Prop. 209 was unconstitutional. Unfortunately,
a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently overturned a district court
injunction which had stayed implementation of Proposition 209, ruling that the initiative was
constitutional. Obviously, we are disappointed with the panel's decision.

The plaintiffs in the Prop. 209 litigation have petitioned for a rehearing of the panel's decision
before the Fifth Circuit as a whole. The Justice Department has continued as amicus in this
petition and fully expects to continue as a party in the case through any further appeals.

Notwithstanding the outcome of the Prop. 209 litigation, the Administration will require
institutions in California to comply with all Federal laws, including those which require
affirmative action, and we have made this clear to these institutions. Further, Prop. 209 itself
contains a provision exempting from its reach those institutions which are complying with
Federal affirmative action programs as a condition of receiving a Federal grant.


2. Why is SBA's 8(a) program included in the federal procurement regulations?

Our proposed system for reforming federal procurement sets out a framework under which an
annual comparison of the availability and use of small disadvantaged businesses will determine
whether race conscious means, such as price or evaluation credits, will be permitted to help
increase opportunities for these firms.

Many commentators to our proposal have asserted that we should not include contracts awarded
under the Sea) program in the reform framework. First, we believe that it is critical that the
availability ofSDB's in an industry not be undercounted so that we can make an accurate
determination of the level of federal utilization of such firms that would be appropriate. As
such, minority firms in the 8(a) program must be counted in the capacity or "benchmark"
numbers. Only by determining how much minority participation in contracting exists, through
all means, can we figure out the extent to which race-conscious means continue to be needed in a
particular industry.

Second, as proposed, the SBA Administrator will have the authority to decide what steps are
needed, if any, to limit the use of the 8(a) program in a particular industry where SDB
participation exceeds an industry benchmark. However, the Administrator will not be required
to take such steps -- the benchmark numbers will serve as a guide to the Administrator, not a
mandate. Nevertheless, we believe strongly that some limited reform of 8(a) is needed to ensure




                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
determining eligibility -- small minority firms are allowed the presumption of being socially
disadvantaged under the program. As such, although the Justice Department continues to
vigorously defend 8(a) in court as constitutional, we believe that the substantial risk of future
court rulings unfavorable to the program greatly outweighs the costs of this limited reform.

SBA will be explaining how it intends to implement this limited reform in proposed regulations
they will issue in a few weeks. Their proposed rule will also be published for comment in the
Federal Register and is expected to be finalized later this year.


3. Please clarify the Administration's position on set-asides, e.g., is there still a moratorium
on set-asides?

The primary SDB set-aside program authorized by existing contracting regulations, the
Department of Defense's "Rule of Two," was suspended in light of Adarand in October 1995,
and remains so. Under the Justice Department's May 1996 proposal, the suspension on the use
of set-asides such as the Rule of Two would have remained in place for at least two years after
the implementation of the reformed system. The proposal contemplated that after two years we
would evaluate the system to consider whether set-asides might be appropriate if the new system
clearly was unable to remedy persistent and substantial underutilization of minority firms in
particular industries resulting from past or present discrimination.

Many comments to the Justice Department's May 1996 proposal suggested that the two-year
moratorium was too inflexible. We agreed that whether to permit set-aside contracts in any
industry should not turn on the lapse of any particular period of time, but on the amount and
strength of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of the new system in that industry. In cases
where this rigorous standard is met, the use of set-asides can be considered.


4. DOT programs are not included in these federal procurement regs. What will DOT be
issuing on its own?

The Department of Transportation will soon be issuing a Supplemental Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking concerning its disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) program. This program
operates through state and local governments that receive DOT financial assistance for highway,
transit, and airport projects.

DOT will give the public 60 days to comment on the proposed regulations and we expect that
they will be finalized later this year. DOT's DBE program, which Congress established in 1982,
sets a nationwide goal that, unless the Secretary determines otherwise, at least 10% of the
amounts appropriated for Federally-assisted highway transit and airport projects be expended
with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged
individuals. The department retained the current legislative language in its NEXTEA bill,
which the President recently submitted to Congress.

decision in Adarand Constructors v. Pena and President Clinton's July 15 directive to mend
affirmative action programs. In addressing these issues, the proposed regulations will: (1)
propose several alternative methods by which recipients establish DBE goals; (2) advise
recipients to give priority to race-neutral measures, like outreach and technical assistance, in
meeting these goals; and (3) provide recipients more flexibility in determining what mechanisms
to use in addressing discrimination in contracting. The proposal also provides clearer program
eligibility standards and reduces burdens on small businesses and state and local governments.


5. Under the guise of efficiency this Administration has created an environment where
consolidation or bundling of contracts is viewed as more cost efficient. As a result, small
businesses, especially minority small businesses have been unable to compete against larger
businesses that have more resources, bonding and personnel. What is the
Administration's position on contract bundling and does it plan to continue this practice?

There are many situations where the government is able to achieve dramatic price reductions by
leveraging its buying power as a large purchaser. For example, in consolidating a number of
contracts for pharmaceuticals, the Veterans Administration has achieved price savings of as
much as 75% compared with prices they were previously paying. The government is able to
obtain Federal Express delivery for a three-pound package that retails at $27 for $3.62 by
aggregating our buying power. Especially in a tight budget environment where excessively high
contract costs come at the expense of needed money for public programs, it would be
unconscionable to forego the ability to obtain these price discounts from quantity buying.

However, there are also legitimate concerns about situations where combining smaller service
contracts into larger contract vehicles not only hurts the ability of small businesses to compete
for government business, but also deprives agencies of the services of businesses that would
otherwise be able to provide high-quality services at advantageous prices. The Administration
is therefore aggressively formulating a whole series of countermeasures to preserve the ability of
competitive small and minority-owned businesses to serve government customers. Examples of
these countermeasures include: (I) increased use of small-business and 8(a) prime contract set
asides incorporated into multiple-award aggregated contracts, a technique that has already been
used by the Department of Transportation and the Air Force; (2) streamlining of the 8(a)
contract award process, so award of 8(a) contracts can be as streamlined as the award of task
orders under large aggregated contracts; (3) a new ability for the government to award service
contracts up to $100,000 to small businesses using far more streamlined procedures; (4)
expansion of the GSA services schedule to more small and minority-owned businesses, so these
businesses have a contract vehicle available that allows them streamlined access to government
customers outside large aggregated contracts; and (5) aggressive efforts in regulation to provide
various ways to increase the participation of small and minority-owned businesses in service
subcontracting. We believe that this aggressive approach is the best way to deal with legitimate
concerns without depriving the taxpayer and the consumers of government programs of the
benefits of consolidated contracting when it provides advantageous pricing and service.

Under the Administration's proposed legislation, the "Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of
1997", juveniles prosecuted as juveniles could not be housed with adults until they reach age
18, regardless of the offense. Moreover, no juvenile under age 16 who has been charged or
convicted as an adult, can be housed with an adult under the proposed bill. Juveniles prosecuted
as adults can be housed with adults after they reach the age of \6, at the discretion of the Bureau
of Prisons.

As juveniles have become increasingly violent, however, housing such dangerous juveniles with
other juveniles can endanger younger, and sometimes more vulnerable, delinquents. The
Administration believes it is more appropriate to give federal prison authorities the ability to be
flexible depending upon the needs of the individual defendant.


7. Why is the Administration supporting the prosecution of more juveniles as adults?

The current process for determining whether a juvenile will be prosecuted as an adult or as a
juvenile is often highly unpredictable. The Administration's bill does not add any new offenses
for which a juvenile can be charged in federal court.

However, the Administration bill does expand the circumstances where ajuvenile can be charged
as an adult by giving federal prosecutors the discretion to transfer juvenile offenders to adult
criminal court. It should be noted that except for the most serious juvenile offenders, age 16 and
older, juveniles charged as adults may petition the court to be tried as juveniles rather than adults.


8. Why is the Administration supporting more mandatory minimum sentences for
juveniles?

The Administration's legislation increases mandatory minimum sentences from one year to three
years for three narrowly targeted crimes: selling drugs to minors; using minors to distribute
drugs; and trafficking drugs in or near a school or other protected location. The Administration
believes that the proposed increases are necessary to punish persons who endanger children by
selling illegal drugs to them, or employ or otherwise use them in their drug trade, and to deter
others from engaging in such reprehensible and dangerous conduct.

The mandatory minimum sentences could apply to juveniles who are prosecuted as adults.
However, it should be noted that "safety valves" on mandatory sentences may be applied to
13-15 year olds in certain circumstances.


9. Why is the Administration supporting making public the records of individuals
prosecuted as juveniles?

                                                           Hex.Dump Conversion
The Administration's bill contains important protections for the rights of victims, including the
victims of crimes committed by juvenile offenders. The bill clarifies current law by extending
to victims of juvenile offenders the right to information about the juvenile proceeding that they
might need or be entitled to under state or federal law. For example, victims would be able find
out about the status of the proceedings, or the release status of the offender. Fingerprints and
photographs of adjudicated delinquents found to have committed the equivalent of an adult
felony offense or a federal gun offense would be sent to the FBI and made available in the same
manner applicable to adult defendants.

The Administration believes these changes represent a fair balance between maintaining
important protections for juveniles and expanding the information available to their victims.


10. What is the Administration's policy on Africa, e.g., Zaire and Sudan?


ZAIRE

Our goal is to support the emergence of a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous Zaire in
which human rights are respected. To this end, the U.S. continues actively to assist South
African and UN efforts to facilitate a non-violent transition from the Government of President
Mobutu to an inclusive transitional governing authority mandated to restore the economy and
conduct democratic elections in a reasonable, fixed time frame. We continue to press the
warring parties in Zaire and their supporters to respect human rights and provide full support and
access to international humanitarian organizations seeking to assist and repatriate refugees. We
are engaging the Alliance leadership in an on-going dialogue to encourage the adoption of
responsible policies with respect to democracy, governance, human rights and economic
management. We have also made clear that the extent of U.S. and international support for any
new government will depend to a significant degree on the manner in which it comes to power
and its current and future policies and practices.


SUDAN

The Government of Sudan (GOS) poses a direct threat to U.S. national security interests.
Through its support for terrorism, its efforts to destabilize friendly neighboring states,
prosecution of the civil war and persistent human rights abuses (including slavery), the GOS has
consistently engaged in destructive activities that are contrary to international norms. Our policy
objective is to isolate Sudan and contain the threat it poses to its neighbors and others in the
international community. Through a combination of pressure and limited dialogue, we aim also
to try to change the behavior of the GOS. The U.S. has placed the GOS on the terrorist list and
applied unilateral sanctions consistent with that designation. The U.S. also silpports multilateral
sanctions against Sudan in the UN Security Council. In addition, the U.S. is providing

    approximately $20 million in defensive, non-lethal military assistance to Ethiopia, Eritrea and
    Uganda-neighboring states which face Sudanese-sponsored insurgencies. Finally, the U.S.
    supports regional efforts under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
    (lOAD) to broker a peaceful resolution to the civil conflict in Sudan and continues to provide
    substantial humanitarian assistance to the UN and NOOs to save the lives of southern Sudanese
    civilians.


    11. The Lome Convention guarantees the Caribbean countries banana preferences until
    2002. Will the U.S. place a moratorium on the implementation of the World Trade
    Organization (WTO) banana decision until2002?

    The U.S. is but one of five complainants in the case and the others will not agree to a long
    implementation period. Also, it would set a bad precedent relative to the EU's implementation
    of other panel decisions, like the recently announced interim panel on Beef Hormones, which the
    U.S. is desperate for the EU to implement.

    In addition, the WTO dispute settlement process states that the indicative maximum period for
    implementation after adoption of the report is 15 months. For the sake of the WTO system and
    U.S. export interests in other areas, 15 months must be the maximum; we are likely to seek a
    shorter period, since the EU has known for years of the problems.
