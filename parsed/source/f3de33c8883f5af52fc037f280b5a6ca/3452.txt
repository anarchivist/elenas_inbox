TEXT:
The President will be taping a radio PSA after the radio address on
Saturday. (Bob Dole isn't doing one). Reno will unveil the Presiden'ts PSA
at her Thursday press availability next week.  The Executive Order would
then need to be ready by September 10 when POTUS can announce it at a
White House meeting of members of the disability community.  Is that a
realistic time frame? Maria Echaveste and vicki Radd talked about how
they would help keep the pressure on Dept. of Labor to get it ready in
time, fyi.
