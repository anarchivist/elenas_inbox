TEXT:
Ron asked me to follow up with you on your conversation about the

possibility of an event next week where the VP could announce an OMB or

Treasury analysis of the reduction of youth smoking that could be

generated by the President's tobacco plan.       w~   are tentatively looking at

a VP event for Wednesday where he releases the analysis and calls on

Congress to enact comprehensive, not piece-meal legislation.



Two things:    1}   When is the President scheduled to do a tobacco event

next week?     (We obviously would not want the VP's event to interfere and

would want to schedule it advance of any Presidential event).         2}   Do you

have any information on whether or not OMB or Treasury will be able to

generate these numbers for next week and can you please let me know how or

who you would like me to follow up with.



Thanks very much.
