TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:

Kent called me to say that a subcommittee of the Federal Support for
Communities group (the AG's proposed project that I speak to her about
personally ... ) was set to formally recommend where/how it should be
handled, and wanted to make sure we were on board. In short, they are
recommending that the FSC initiative be:

(1) jointly sponsored by NPR and DPC;
(2) staffed by and housed at NPR; and
(3) overseen by senior staff of all the involved agencies.

He stressed that DPC was not expected to do any of the heavy lifting, but
that the group thought it important to maintain a tie -- at least in name
-- to the DPC.  I've told him, with the understanding that NPR was taking
the lead on this, joint sponsorship shouldn't be a problem. Am I right?

Jose'
