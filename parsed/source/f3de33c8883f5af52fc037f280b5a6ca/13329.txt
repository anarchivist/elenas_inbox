DRAFT 2 - ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON LOGGING RIDER
TALKING POINTS

?       The Administration is convinced that the "logging rider" on
the rescissions act has to be changed.
?       Ancient forests are being clearcut. Critical habitat for
fish and wildlife is being destroyed.   Wild places that
·

    almost everyone in the Northwest and the country want to
    protect are being lost forever.   This has to stop.
    ?       The logging rider has reopened wounds that were just
    beginning to heal.  It is dividing people and communities.
    This has to stop.
    ?       In addition to the problems with the old growth provisions,
    a significant number of concerns have been raised regarding
    implementation of the salvage logging program.
    ?       The Northwest deserves better.    Forest policy should be
    predictable and fair. Environmental protections should be
    solid. Harvest levels should be sustainable. Agencies
    should be accountable for their actions. Most of all, the
    people who own the forests need to know that their values
    and their voices are being heard.
    ?       This Administration's Northwest Forest Plan is the right way
    to run federal forests in the Northwest. We have to get
    back to that plan. We also have to make sure that the
    salvage program meets the President's directive to obey
    environmental law.
    ?       We have to change the logging rider.    The Administration
    believes that we must:
    1.      Repeal the provisions of the logging rider that opened
    up the Northwest's ancient forests and closed the courts to
    protecting old growth timber;
    2.      Repeal the provisions that some in the timber industry
    want to use to disrupt the Forest Plan.

    3.       Suspend the salvage timber program in Oregon,
    Washington, Idaho, and Montana for 45 days to allow a full,
    objective review of the program's implementation in those
    states-, and
    4.       Get agreement from Congress to provide the Forest
    Service and BLM the funding and other authorities they need
    to buy
    o
    -back or find substitute timber for old
    o
    -growth sales

    released under the rider that simply shouldn't be cut.
    ?       We will work with Senator Murray, Senator Wyden,
    Congresswoman Furse, and others in the Northwest delegation
    to win passage of these changes. We know there will be
    opposition. But we are determined to get Northwest forest
    management back on track and to restore the balanced and
    reasonable approach that is achieved under the Northwest
    Forest plan.
