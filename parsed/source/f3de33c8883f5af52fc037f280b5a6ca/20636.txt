TEXT:
Below is the House Rules SAP for VA/HUD Appropriations.  The language is
identical to previous House committee letters cleared except for the
following places: 2nd par. (veto threat including income targeting
provisions); 5th par. under HUD; and Cosumer Product Saftey Commission
paragraph on last page. Rules Committee meets at 2pm today; therefore we
need comments by lpm.  Thanks.

H.R. 4194 DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND
HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND INDEPENDENT AGENCIES


                                            APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors: Livingston (R), Louisiana;            Lewis (R),
California)
        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationO,s views on H.R. 4194, the Departments of Veterans Affairs
and Housing and Urban Development,. and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee. Your
consideration of the AdministrationO,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate certain of the PresidentO,s priorities within the 302(b)
allocation. However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the
necessary investments in programs funded by this bill. As a result,
critical programs are not funded or are underfunded, in particular, key
Presidential priorities such as funding for National Service, Superfund,
and climate change. Furthermore, the Administration is very concerned
that the Committee has included problematic language regarding the Kyoto
Protocol and other issues.  Finally, the Administration understands that
an amendment may be offered to include unacceptable provisions now
contained in H.R. 2, such as income targeting, that are unacceptable.   If
the bill were presented to the President without responding to these
concerns, the President's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the
bill.

        The only way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to
offset discretionary spending by using savings in other areas.  The
President's FY 1999 Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending for
FY 1999 that conform to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings
in mandatory and other programs available to help finance this spending.
In the Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad, bipartisan basis
   took similar action in approving funding for surface transportation
programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work with the
Congress on mutually agreeable mandatory and other offsets that could be
used to increase high-priority discretionary programs, including those
funded by this bill.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the Committee
bill. We look forward to working with the House to resolve these concerns
as the bill moves forward.



Corporation for National and Community Service

        The Administration strongly objects to the termination of the
Corporation for Nation~l and Community Service, one of the
Administration's top priorities.   Eliminating funding for the Corporation
would deny more than 49,000 Americans the opportunity to serve as
AmeriCorps members in projects such as America Reads, the Administration's
effort to raise student literacy through the use of tutors to supplement
the school day activities.   In addition, over one million students of all
ages would forego the chance to participate in service learning activities
in their schools and neighborhoods.   The funding level in the Committee
bill for the Corporation for National and Community Service is
unacceptable.

Environmental Protection Agency

       The Administration has several major concerns with the


CommitteeO,s mark for the Environmental Protection Agency.  In particular,
the Administration strongly objects to the $593 million, or 28-percent,
reduction to the PresidentO,s request for Superfund, which would delay
cleanups at sites nationwide and needlessly jeopardize public health.   In
addition, the Administration opposes the $16 million, or 18-percent,
reduction to the request for brownfields funding as well as restrictive
bill language that would hamper achievement of brownfield cleanups by
preventing their use for removals, cleanups, and revolving loan funds.
The Administration urges the House to restore Superfund to the requested
level and to delete the restrictive brownfields language.

        The Administration strongly opposes the CommitteeO,s $106 million
reduction in EPA funding for the Climate Change Technology Initiative.
This high-priority program should be funded fully to cut energy usage,
save consumers money, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We will work
with the Congress to restore requested funding as the bill moves forward.

        The Administration strongly opposes bill and report language
relating to the Kyoto Protocol. While the Administration does not intend
to implement the Protocol until it is ratified, the bill language could be
interpreted broadly to prevent activities that limit greenhouse gases --
for example, through enhancing energy efficiency -- but that are
authorized under current law. The report language also inappropriately
purports to prevent public explanation of Executive Branch endeavors
related to treaty negotiations and other activities related to climate
change. The Administration opposes this and other riders because they
inappropriately use the legislative process by denying the public and
Members of Congress the opportunity to examine and debate these proposals
openly.

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeO,s providing full
funding for the presidentO,s Clean Water Action Plan, which is designed to
prevent pollution run-off and protect public health. The Administration
urges the Committee to provide the full $50 million request to help
improve water quality in Boston Harbor and prevent beach closings.

        The Administration is concerned with the large number of
unrequested, earmarked projects in the Committee mark for EPA,
particularly when the Committee has reduced several other high-priority
Administration initiatives, including right-to-know programs, Montreal
Protocol, GLOBE, and Mexican border wastewater treatment funding.

Department of Housing and Urban Development

         The Administration is concerned about the funding levels provided
for key. programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
particularly for welfare-to-work housing vouchers and other programs, such
as the Community Empowerment Fund, that would expand job opportunities.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decision to fund
17,700 incremental "Welfare-to-Work" housing vouchers. with over 3
million families needing to make the transition from welfare to work, and
in light of recent studies that show historically high unmet housing need
among very low-income Americans, the Administration believes it is
critical for the Congress to fund the entire 50,000 welfare-to-work
housing vouchers provided for in the President's request. welfare-to-work
housing vouchers will support implementation of welfare reform by
assisting those welfare recipients who need housing assistance to get or
keep a job.


        The Administration also encourages the Congress to fund fully the
President's request for $400 million for an Economic Development
Initiative Community Empowerment Fund to generate jobs in distressed
communities. The Committee has cut the request by $350 million, providing
only $50 million, as a set-aside within the existing CDBG program.

        The Administration appreciates the Committee's decisions to fund a
number of programs at the levels requested, including the Partnership for
Advancing Technologies in Housing (PATH) initiative, and to renew all
expiring Section 8 contracts.   The Administration is encouraged that the
Committee has provided funding for half the President's request for
Regional Opportunity Counseling, a voluntary effort to expand the housing
and employment opportunities available to low-income families.  We urge
full funding of the President's request for this program. We are also
pleased by the CommitteeD,s decision to provide $80 million for the Office
of Lead Hazard Control, to reduce the risk of childhood lead poisoning and
other health hazards. The Administration encourages the Congress to fund
fully a number of other areas -- Homeless Assistance, Brownfields, and
Regional Connections--and to end the ninety-day delay in reissuing of
Section 8 certificates/vouchers on turnover.

        The Administration is very concerned that the Subcommittee has not
included language extending the repeal of one-for-one replacement for
public housing. Without this language, the bipartisan goal of demolishing
100,000 of the worst public housing units by FY 2003 may not be achieved.

        The Administration is pleased with the Committee's decision to
support an audit-based enforcement initiative for the Fair Housing
Initiatives program. We urge the Congress to fund fully this critical
fair housing initiative to reduce the level of housing discrimination.

        The Administration urges the Congress to adopt the
Administration'S proposal to reform HUD's single-family property
disposition program, which would produce substantial savings by improving
the efficiency of FHAO,s property disposition processes and would permit
the Committee to provide additional resources to critical Committee
programs.  In addition, we support providing greater homeownership
opportunities by increasing the FHA loim limit to the GSE "conforming"
limit.

Council on Environmental Quality

         The Administration appreciates the modest increase over the FY
1998 level provided for the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).
However, we strongly believe that in order to allow CEQ to carry out its
environmental mission and reinvention efforts, the full requested level
should be provided, and language prohibiting use of detailees should be
deleted.

Community Development Financial Institutions Fund

        The Administration strongly urges the Committee to fund the
Community Development Financial Institutions Fund at the requested level.
The CommitteeO,s decision to reduce the request by $45 million would
severely reduce the FundO,s ability to leverage investments, loans, and
financial services in the countryO,s most distressed communities.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration

        The Administration is concerned with the CommitteeO,s reductions


        to the requests for the International Space Station, Space Shuttle, and
        Earth Science programs. Full funding in FY 1999 for Space Station is
        critical as the united States and our International Partners are in a peak
        period of development and integration, and proceeding toward First Element
        Launch later this year.  Further, the Administration is particularly
        concerned about bill language prohibiting the use of funds for the Triana
        project. Triana offers a unique opportunity to educate and engage
        students in all phases of the mission.   Its observations could potentially
        be used in meteorology and environmental monitoring, as well as for
        commercial purposes. The Administration will work with the Congress to
        enable restoration of funding for these priority programs as the bill
        proceeds. The Administration is also concerned over the large number of
        unrequested, site-specific earmarks, which would have the effect of
        circumventing the competitive, peer review process and are paid for, in
        part, with serious reductions to priority programs.

        Federal Emergency Management Agency

                The Administration appreciates the level of funding provided by
        the Committee for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  However, we
        believe that the $20 million reduction to the President's request for
        pre-disaster mitigation grants is shortsighted. These grants would help
        reduce the cost of future disasters by leveraging local and private-sector
        support for enhanced mitigation efforts at the State and community level.
        We urge the Committee to fund fully the President's request for this
        important initiative.  In addition, we urge the Committee to approve our
        recent request for funding to help States and communities prepare for
        potential terrorist incidents involving chemical and/or biological weapons.

        National Science Foundation

                Given the budget constraints facing the Committee, the
        Administration appreciates the effort to provide a $268 million increase
        over the FY 1998 level for the National Science Foundation (NSF).
        Nevertheless, the Administration is concerned with the reduction to the
        request for education and human resources and the elimination of funds for
        the proposed Polar Cap Observatory and NSF funds for the GLOBE program.
        The Administration is firmly committed to NSF's research and education
        activities, which not only promote scientific advancement but also
        contribute to economic develop
