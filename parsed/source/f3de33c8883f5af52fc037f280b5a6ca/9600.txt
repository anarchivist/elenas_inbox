Subject:         Re: Labor/HHS riders

        The WTW "rider" is, in fact, the technical amendment that we
support. Barbara wanted to have some langauge handy that we could drop
into the omnibus approps bill if the SSI bill stalls in the Senate. Do
you know whether there's a formal hold in the Senate on H.R. 4558?
