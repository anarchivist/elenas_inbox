DRAFT DRAFT
                     Enhancing Protection of Children's Health
                                    April 16, 1997

        Vice President Gore today announced an executive order to reduce
environmental health and safety risks to children. For the first time, federal agencies
will be required to assign high priority to addressing these risks, to coordinate their
research priorites on children's health, and to ensure that their standards take into
account special risks to children. The executive order, which President Clinton signed
today, includes the following actions:

·     Strengthen Policies to Protect Children. The executive order requires all
      agencies to make the protection of children a high priority in implementing their
      statutory responsibilities and fulfilling their overall missions.

·     Improve Research and other Initiatives to Protect Children. The proposed
      executive order would create an interagency task force to establish a
      coordinated research agenda, to identify research and other initiatives the
      Administration will take to advance the protection of children's environmental
      health and safety, and to enlist public input for these efforts.

·     Ensure that New Safeguards Consider Special Risks to Children. The
      executive order would, for the first time, require agencies to analyze and explain
      the effects of their rules on children. When a major regulation addresses
      special risks to children, agencies would have to 1) consider disproportionate
      impacts on children; and
      2) explain why their proposed action is preferable to other alternatives. The
      primary goal of this provision is to link policy decisions to the emerging science
      regarding children's environmental health and safety. This provision ensures
      accountability to the public and helps agencies identify their research needs.

BACKGROUND
        There is a growing body of evidence, highlighted by a 1993 study by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) on the exposure of children to pesticides, demonstrating
that children are at disproportionate risk from environmental health, and safety risks.
The report also concludes that federal regulatory standards often fail to consider these
risks fully.

       These disproportionate risks stem from several fundamental differences between
children and adults, in terms of physiology and activity. Children are still developing,
and thus are neurologically and immunologically more susceptible to certain risks.
Children eat, drink and breathe more for their weight, exposing them to greater amounts
of contamination and pollution for their weight. Children are less able to protect
themselves by use of judgment and skill (e.g. navigating traffic, reading and following
warnings). Concurrent with their recognition of these factors, scientists have
                                                                Hex-Dilmp Conversion

documented an alarming increase in the incidence of conditions in children that may be
linked to environmental health and safety risks. These include childhood cancer,
leukemia, and asthma, as well as childhood deaths and injuries from accidents.

       President Clinton has taken bold action to respond to the challenge posed by
this new science. President Clinton's initiatives resulted in explicit protection for
children in the Food Quality Protection Act and Safe Drinking Water Act; development
of new standards for passive restraints in cars that are more protective of children; and
administrative action to protect children from tobacco, lead, and other hazards. Each
of these initiatives responds to major threats to children that are of major concerns to
American families.

       These successes highlight the need for an overall, coordinated approach to
children's issues that highlights their priority, coordinates federal research, and ensures
that federal standards consistently account for disproportionate risks to children.
Today's executive order, developed though extensive consultation with affected
agencies, would fill this gap with provisions to address each of these areas.
