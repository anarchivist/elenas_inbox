TEXT:
Jim O'Hara called and said HHS feesl very strongly that this report should
be released at the White House. Their concern is one part tradition,
which I could care less about (Surgeon's General reports are "always"
released at either the White House or the Department) and it is one part
group politics (they fear the minority members and groups will feel
slighted    why was the Surgeon General's report on minorities not
released at the White House when that's where these things are usually
done)?

I vaguely remember this being an issue for the Tuskegee apology ...

What do you think?   Should we check in with someone like Minyon?
