  TEXT:
, At yesterday's tobacco strategy meeting several people mentioned rumors
  about a possible settlement in the MN case.  I have checked with a couple
  of senior members of Humphrey's staff and they told me that there are
  currently no discussions with the industry about a settlement of their
  case nor are they expecting any, that Humphrey has been on record for some
  time about what it would take to settle the case (I'll let you just
  imagine the terms), and that the state has at least another month to go in
  presenting its case.

While I hadn't heard any MN rumors, I have heard rumors about a m'aj or
announcement in the next 2 months from the Justice criminal investigation.
