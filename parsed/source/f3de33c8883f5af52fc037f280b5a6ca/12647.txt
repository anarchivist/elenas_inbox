House GOP Maps Cuts in Bills

                            By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bills covering education,
                            environment and other traditional Democratic
priorities face
                            billions of dollars in cuts next year under
emerging Republican
                            plans. The proposals signal bitter clashes ahead
within
                            Congress and between lawmakers and President
Clinton.

                            Honoring tight spending limits agreed to in the
1997
                            budget-balancing deal, the House Appropriations
Committee
                            plans to decide this week how it would divide
$538 billion
                            among 13 bills covering all government agencies.
..
     That
                              represents almost a third of the entire federal
     budget, including
                              everything but automatic payments like Medicare
     benefits and
                              interest to bond holders.

                              The committee's blueprint, obtained by The
     Associated Press,
                              shows that the appropriations committee plans to
     use $78.1
                              billion for the Labor, Education and Health and
     Human
                              Services departments -- $10.7 billion less than
     this year. That
                              measure is home to schools,    job training and
     other programs
                              that produce annual battles between Democrats and
                              Republicans, and the proposed cut assures a
     nasty partisan
                              fight.

                              Of the other three, large domestic spending
     bills, the committee
                              would spend $30.5 billion for the Commerce,
     Justice and State
                              departments, which is $2.8 billion less than
     this year; $11.3
                              billion for the Interior Department, or $2.7
     billion less; .and
                              $66.2 billion for the Veterans Affairs, Housing
     and Urban
                              Development departments, the Environmental
     Protection
                              Agency and other agencies, which is $5.8 billion
     below this
                              year's level.

                              These committee figures do not include.
     additional billions in
                              so-called emergency spending enacted this year
     -- money that
                              does not count against spending limits. Even
     with that extra
                              money, however, the fiscal 2000 bills come up
     short compared
                              to this year, and even shorter compared to the
     amounts Clinton
                              would like to spend.

                              The cuts appear so deep that it is unclear
     whether bills at such
                              low levels can even pass the GOP-controlled
     Congress, let
                              alone get signed by Clinton.

                              When asked whether his bill would pass the
     House, Rep. Ralph
                              Regula, R-Ohio, chairman of the committee's
     interior


                           subcommittee, said: " r think .it will be
difficult. ' ,

                           When asked about the strategy for passing the
appropriations
                           bills, Regula said: --r haven't heard of one
yet. ' ,

                           Most of the other, smaller domestic spending
bills have just
                           minor differences between GOP plans for 2000 and
actual
                           totals from the current year. Several of them
could become law
                           with relatively little controversy.

                           But in one indicator of the pressure on
Republicans to exceed
                           spending limits, a bill approved Friday by the
appropriations
                           panel's Treasury-Postal Service subcommittee
totaled $13.7
                           billion -- more than $140 million above the
amount leaders plan
                           for that subcommittee to spend.

                           Under the budget-balancing deal, an escalating,
annual series of
                           savings were planned in an effort to eliminate
what looked like
                           a parade of unending federal deficits.

                           Since the. beginning of this year, many Demo'crats
and some
                           Republicans have said this year's spending limit
will have to be
                           breached because the required savings are too
tough.

                           But Republican leaders have continued to insist
publicly that the
                           so-called spending caps must be obeyed. The
Senate's
                           spending plans are similar to the House's, aides
say.

                           --r   think we should stay within the caps, "   said
Senate Majority
                           Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,   in a brief
interview. --We knew the
                           caps would pinch. ' ,

                           To spend beyond those limits means using the
federal surplus,
                           and that would mean spending Social Security
surpluses
                           Republicans have promised to not spend or
leaving less money
                           available to pay for the tax cut. Cutting taxes
and protecting


                         social Security are both major GOP priorities,
and jeopardizing
                         either would outrage conservatives.

                         It is unclear how Republicans plan to move all
13 annual
                         spending bills through Congress, and do so
without prompting a
                         veto fight with Clinton.

                         Some GOP aides said their strategy calls for
spending weeks
                         this summer focusing on the message that
Republicans are
                         honoring spending limits to protect Social
Security and tax cuts.
                         The goal is to identify the GOP with those
goals, and to ensure
                         that in the likelihood that the spending caps
are broken, that
                         Clinton and congressional Democrats are to
blame.
