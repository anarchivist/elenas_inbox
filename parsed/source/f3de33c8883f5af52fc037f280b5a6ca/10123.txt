TEXT:
The FAA sent this over as possible event: The FAA would issue an NPRM that
would require   (or promote the voluntary disclosure) that airlines provide
their flight data recorder (black box) data to the FAA on an ongoing basis
in order to enhance safety in such areas as training, operating procedures
and air crew performance, air traffic control, airport maintenance and
design, and aircraft operations and design. Aviation industry groups have
stated that they would support the voluntary implementation of this
disclosure-, subject to FAA assurance that information obtained would not
be used in punitive enforcement actions.   Currently, the FAA uses the
black box data primarily only after accidents occur. This initiative
would permit the data to be used to prevent future accidents. This could
be ready in mid-December.
