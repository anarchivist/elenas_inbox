I.    PURPOSE

      To thank the International Association of Fire Fighters for their support and commend
      them for their bravery, loyalty, and dedication to public service; and to announce new
      efforts to provide firefighters and other first responders with the tools they need to defend
      against terrorist attacks involving chemical and biological weapons.

II.   BACKGROUND

      The International Association of Firefighters

      You will address over 700 participants at the 17th Annual Legislative Conference of the
      International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). IAFF represents more than 225,000
      professional career fire fighters and emergency medical personnel. The association
      represents local and state employees, federal workers, and fire and emergency medical
      workers employed at certain industrial facilities. It is affiliated with the AFL-CIO and
      the Canadian Labor Congress. IAFF members protect more than 85 percent of the
      people and property in the United States, and are the largest providers of pre-hospital
      emergency care in the U.S. Since its founding in 1918, the IAFF has worked to: create
      important fire fighting health and safety regulations; enact federal benefits for survivors
      of fire fighters killed or totally disabled in the line of duty; enhance public safety through
      national standards; improve training and education for fire and emergency personnel; and
      establish training programs for hazardous materials emergencies.



      Strong New Efforts to Help Emergency Response Personnel Combat Chemical and Biological
                                        Hex.[)ump Cont'e:sion
       Terrorism

       America's unrivaled military preparedness means that potential enemies are more likely to
       resort to terror than to conventional military assault. In addition, new technologies are
       increasing the ability of terrorists to plan and execute chemical and biological attacks
       against our cities and citizens. In response, you are announcing new steps and highlighted
       continuing efforts to combat the threat of a chemical or biological terrorist attack,
       including:

       Investing an additional $11 million in Metropolitan Medical Response Systems in FY 1999.
       The Department of Health and Human Services plans to invest an additional $11 million
       in FY 1999 in new rapid medical response teams trained to respond to a biological or
       chemical weapons emergency. The Metropolitan Medical Response Systems enhance local
       emergency response systems by removing victims, administering antidotes,
       decontaminating affected areas, and providing emergency medical transportation, primary
       care, hospital based medical care and crisis counseling. This new funding increases the
       previously planned FY 1999 funding level by almost 400 percent, supporting the
       development of rapid medical response teams in an additional 12 cities. Today's action
       takes a significant step towards the Administration's goal of establishing these teams in all
       of the nation's most densely populated metropolitan areas nationwide.

       Providing funds to train emergency personnel to respond to chemical and biological attacks.
       The Department of Justice will award this month the first funds from a $21 million
       initiative to combat weapons of mass destruction by helping states and local communities
       train local first responders (including firefighters) about responding to bioterrorist and
       other terrorist attacks. Some of these funds will also enable local communities to expand
       awareness of the threat of chemical and biological attacks.

       Giving funds to communities to purchase new equipment for emergency response personnel
       handling a chemical or biological terrorist attack. The Department of Justice will make
       available in April $73.5 million in grants to states and municipalities to procure equipment
       to detect chemical or biological agents and protect emergency response personnel and
       other first responders in the event of a terrorist attack.
