TEXT:
wellstone is on Senate floor right now raising concerns about what is
happening to those leaving the welfare rolls, as well as declining food
stamps participation.  He has proposed an amendment to Defense bill to
require HHS to include in its annual report to Congress information on the
employment, job retention, earnings, health insurance status, child care
access and costs for former TANF recipients for the 1st 24 months after
they leave assistance.  Sounds like the Rs are willing to accept the
amendment and Dems are asking HHS for the Administration's view on the
amendment.  We've just gotten the language, but based on a quick look,
both we and HHS are inclined to say though we haven't had an opportunity
to develop an official position, we think these are important questions.
Existing HHS research efforts will develop answers to some of these
questions, but not for all recipients or for all states.  There are also
important issues and trade-offs regarding cost, burden on states, and
feasibility of collecting some of the information (in particular for child
care and health insurance status) 24 months after people leave the rolls.

Do you have additional thoughts?
