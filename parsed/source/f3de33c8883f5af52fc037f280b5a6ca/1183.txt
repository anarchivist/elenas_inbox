TEXT:
The focus in the report is primarily on strategies for parents of
school-aged kids, but I think it would be very easy in a radio address to
make a segue to say that we are learning more and more from other
research that parents can't wait until their children reach school-age in
order to help their children begin learning, and that employers and
communities need to do all they can to support that.

While the focus of the report is mostly on elementary school, I just
flipped through the report, and did find at least one reference to a
school that operates an early childhood center as part of its Even Start
family literacy program.   Other strategies discussed, such as getting
good information out to parents, home visits, etc., can be part of the
equation for early learning, too. We could also point out that Title I
funds can be used to help pay for early childhood programs, if communities
decide to make that a priority.

Bruce mentioned the report to Don at the meeting we had this afternoon.
