TEXT:
We can -- and will -- pull back on this one and regroup.
I understand the arguments that have been put forth, and think
they are good. ones.   Let me state a few arguments on the other
side, though, just to make sure we are thinking of all the angles.
First, based on admittedly limited knowledge, it appears that most
states are prepared to ante up on this.    Therefore, giving them
the option to pick and choose may open a door and encourage them
to do so, and thereby reduce coverage we would otherwise get.
Second, unless I am missing something, state budgets already
assume at this point that they will cover all of these people.
Governors may argue in the future that deficits have arisen, and
they need to cut back in this area to reach balance, but at the
moment I don't think anyone has an argument that covering all
legal immigrants will cost them money they weren't planning to
spend.   (I know, that doesn't mean they won't make such an
argument publicly .... )
Finally, I understand the general desirability of offering options
to states on Medicaid, and recognize that states may well try to
shift blame onto us if we make them cover all legal aliens.    But
the state option we would offer them here is to offer citizens one
Medicaid package and legal immigrants another.    You could say we
already crossed the line on making distinctions by citizenship
status when we signed the bill ... but immigration does have more
of a Federal interest to it than many other state options.


Anyway, food for thought.
