No. 145
Wednesday July 29,   1998
Regulation, Law & Economics

Welfare
States Tout Success of Welfare Reform,
Assess Impact Two Years After Passage
U.S. governors July 28 hailed the pace and success of welfare reform as
that law approaches its two-year anniversary, and urged state agencies to
look at "what works" in welfare-to-work programs while the U.S. economy is
strong.
In a joint briefing, Ohio Gov. George V. voinovich (R) and Delaware Gov.
Thomas R. Carper (D) credited the 3.3 million drop in the welfare rolls to
the flexibility of the new welfare law and employers' willingness to hire
welfare recipients. However, both said the results would be weaker if the
U.S. economy were not so vibrant.
Carper said it is important "to use this time wisely," as the nation
continues to experience low unemployment rates and economic growth, "to
perfect" those welfare-to-work programs that work.
Voinovich, chairman of the National 'Governors' Association, and Carper,
NGA's vice chairman, made their comments during a press conference where
the NGA released a "best practice" guide called Working Out of Poverty:
Employment Retention and Career Advancement for Welfare Recipients.
Follow-up Under Way
The dramatic drop in welfare rolls has spurred more than half of the
states to study what happens to former welfare recipients when they leave
the welfare rolls, the types of jobs they get, and whether their families
are better off, Carper said.
Thirty-two states have efforts under way to follow up on individuals
leaving welfare, according to NGA. These studies will give governors an
indication of how well welfare reforms are working and whether changes
need to be made. Recent studies in nine states found that up to 60 percent
of recipients who leave welfare for work find jobs that generally pay
between $5.50 and $7 an hour, according to NGA's Tracking Recipients After
They Leave Welfare.
Some states provide lump-sum cash payments to individuals that can be used
for car repairs, paying rent to prevent eviction, and buying tools or
uniforms, voinovich said. Twenty-two states have programs that help people
find jobs or provide the supports needed for individuals to work, such as
child care, transportation, and medical care, to help them avoid welfare,
according to the NGA.
As case loads decline, states are shifting spending from providing cash
assistance to investing in the support systems that help welfare
recipients and the working poor land and keep jobs and to get the skills
to continue to move on to better-paying jobs, Carper said.
Both governors also said states will focus more attention on the
"hardest-to-serve" welfare recipients, such as those with very ,few skills
or with drug or alcohol problems.
'Don't Meddle,' Voinovich Says
voinovich said that state welfare reform efforts are increasingly part of
 ,                                                                          Page 3 of3


a broader strategy to support the working poor and make work more
attractive than welfare. Eleven states have adopted their own earned
income tax credits for low-wage workers, NGA said.
Voinovich urged Congress and the White House not to "meddle" with the
states' efforts to transform welfare and to maintain the level of funds
and flexibility provided in the 1996 welfare law. Both said the new law
spawned a host of innovative approaches to help welfare recipients find
jobs, as described in the NGA's best practice guide.
More than ever, Carper said, governors are focusing on results in
pay-for-performance contracts with private and nonprofit organizations in
relationships with local governments as states compete for federal bonus
dollars that will be awarded based on job placement, retention, and
earnings.
The governors will convene in Milwaukee, Wis., next week for the NGA's
annual meeting and will spotlight initiatives for improving services for
children in working families.
