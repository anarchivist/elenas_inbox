TEXT:
Bruce did answer this question at the staff meeting.  His concern was
that, in our zeal to keep the Governors from jumping overboard, we should
not spread panic on the labor defects of Shaw's proposal prematurely.
And recent events suggest that our strategy of hanging back and watching
seems wise for the moment     Shaw's process is imploding on its own, and
recent conversations with the Democratic Governors suggest that they are
still thinking about it. And DOL has at least alerted Dem Govs that there
are labor problems with the draft bill, so that we can at least say "I
told you so" if suddenly things heat up, Democratic Governors endorse it,
and we have to blast it.   Does this seem right to you, Cynthia?
