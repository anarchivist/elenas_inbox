               SPEECH TO THE AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION

                                  DATE: February 24,1997
                                  TIME:        1:45pm - 3:10pm
                                  LOCATION: Grand Hyatt Hotel, D.C.
                                  FROM:        Bruce Reed
                                               Gene Sperling
                                               Mike Cohen'

I    PURPOSE:

     To demonstrate and mobilize support among college and university presidents for your
     HOPE Scholarship and Tuition Tax Deduction proposals.

II   BACKGROUND:

     This speech is an opportunity to demonstrate, in advance of budget negotiations, the
     support your budget proposals for higher education enjoy, particularly the Hope
     Scholarship and the Tuition Tax Deduction. In addition, this is an opportunity to
     highlight the progress we have already made on your America ReadsIWork Study
     challenge and to reiterate that challenge in person to 1,300 college and university
     officials.

     At this event, you will be receiving the endorsement of the American Council on
             Education (ACE) Board of Trustees for your package of higher education
     proposals. The Board is expected to pass this resolution on Sunday. In addition, we
     expect that the boards of directors of the Association of Community College Trustees and
     the American Association of Community Colleges will also endorse your package of
     higher education proposals.

     While these endorsements are forthcoming, it is also important to recognize that there is
     concern within the higher education community about the HOPE Scholarship proposal.
     Two concerns have been expressed most frequently. First, college administrators are
     concerned that the reporting requirements to the IRS will be burdensome. Second, many
     are concerned that the tax credits and deductions will favor middle class families at the
     expense of poor families, and would prefer that Pell Grants be used as the vehicle for
     increasing student financial aid. Your speech is designed to respond directly to these
     concerns and to thereby help transform these organizational endorsements into active,
       grass roots support by college presidents nationwide. Hex-D C · n
                                                                 wnp onverslO

       Others have raised concerns about aspects of the HOPE Scholarship proposal, specifically
       that it will lead to tuition and grade inflation. The experience of Georgia colleges and
       universities provide powerful responses to these concerns. Charles Knapp, the President
       of the University of Georgia, will speak prior to your remarks, to address these issues and
       speak to the benefits of HOPE Scholarships.

       ACE is the umbrella higher education organization, representing nearly 1,700 public and
       private 2 and 4-year colleges and universities. Its members are college and university
       presidents, and it is the only organization that represents all sectors of higher education. It
       is the largest organization representing higher education. You will be the keynote
       speaker at their annual conference. You have been the keynote speaker twice before, in
       1993 and 1995.
