Sorry about that.  I was going to send you an e-mail on charter school and
deseg issues, but I am still waiting to confirm some important info from
Counsel's office and Justice. I'll send you the e-mail later in the day or
tomorrow, when I have more solid information.   - Jon

p.s. When are you leaving? Among other reasons why I will be sad to see
you go, I think this issue could really benefit from a few additional
meetings led by you in the coming weeks.  I am fairly concerned about this
issue, but I'll write a longer e-mail when I have the info I need.
