TEXT:
Below is a revised version of yesterday's guidance.  Please not two
changes:
1. The response to the first question puts back in the idea that POTUS
could support a responsible version of Ed-Flex separate from ESEA, though
it then makes the case for why it is better to do this in ESEA.  Since
Kennedy is on the record supporing Frist-Wyden (including in a statement
he issued yesterday) it is important that we not position ourselves too
far from him.  Kennedy's staff is very comfortable with this stance.

2. I added a new Q&A about yesterday's partisan vote.  I framed it in
terms of keeping education on a bipartisan track, though I think the real
issue here is how the partisan move yesterday reflects the increasingly
partisan nature of the impeachment process, and the D's decision to spend
their time defending the President with the press and elsewhere rather
than do legislative business.  I'm not sure how we are addressing this
issue, and didn't know how to prepare a Q&A that reflects it.
