TEXT:
Nickles has an amendment to let states impose sanctions on people and not
have it affect their proposed minimum wage calculation -- i.e., they
wouldn't have to raise the hourly wage to compensate for a sanction. We
assume we'd support, as would HHS, and DOL might want to oppose (we
haven't asked them yet).  Don't know if it's going anywhere.
