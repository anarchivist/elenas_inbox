TEXT:
Several parts of the CEQ package look really good. Particularly the 1000
Rivers, Right to Know, and Safe places. The right to know version we did
last year was quite a hit, although I think it caused particular trouble
with Lott. The 1000 River Systems could be the major on-going
environmental push we've discussed, it is readily understandable-- (I
think it ran into money problems previously) .
