TEXT:
The issue here goes to state administrative discretion.  States
as you know will always take the position in any situation that
they should be free to administer programs free from outside
interference (and that includes the feds, citizens and the
courts) .
APWA and other state types are upset that we are filing an amicus
brief in a situation they believe there should not be a right of
action.
Carol and the President would be among the more sympathetic to the
state arguments, but on the flip side we have been very tough on
the child support issue and supported a larger federal role here
than say in welfare.
Carol has never expressed a strong opinion on this case.
