         But legislation should not adopt the burdensome procedural requirements in the proposed
 settlement. These new requirements are unnecessary because the FDA procedures already
 provide ample opportunities for input from the public, the scientific community, and the industry.
  At the same time, these procedures would significantly hinder the agency's ability to regulate in
 a manner that best serves the public health.

          For example, FDA must currently issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for the
  establishment of a performance standard. This notice must include a finding with
  supporting justification that the performance standard is appropriate and necessary to
. provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device and
  proposed findings with respect to the risk of illness or injury that the performance
  standard is intended to reduce or eliminate, and invite interested persons to submit an
  existing performance standard for the device, including a draft or proposed
  performance standard, for consideration by the Secretary. Upon request of an
  interested party and good cause shown, FDA is required to refer a proposed regulation
  for a performance standard to an advisory committee. After all relevant processes are
  complete, FDA then issues a final performance standard regulation, which is subject to
  judicial review pursuant to the arbitrary and capricious standard.      If a new concerns
  with the standard later arise, FDA regulations explicitly provide for citizen's petitions that
  would allow interested parties to seek redress from the agency.

        The proposed settlement would impose significantly greater procedural
 requirements-formal rule-making procedures. Formal rulemaking is enormously
 resource-intensive and lengthy because it requires an ALJ hearing at which witnesses
 are presented, factual determinations by the ALJ, and review of the ALJ decision by the
 Commissioner. The final decision and standard is reviewable based on a susbtantial
 evidence standard in which FDA would have the burden of proof. In addition, if a
 standard is ever issued, parties may immediately petition FDA to seek judicial review of
 whether a particular modification has resulted in the creation of significant demand for
 contraband and seek judicial review. These provision would have the effect of
 consuming the agency in endless administrative and judiCial processes. By constrast,
 current law provides considerable opportunity for public participation in the development
 and revision of performance standards.

        As this example showes, the heightened requirements in the proposed
 settlement are unnecessary and would significantly hinder the agency's ability to
 regulate in the manner that best serves the goal of protecting the nation's health and
 minimizing future health care costs.
