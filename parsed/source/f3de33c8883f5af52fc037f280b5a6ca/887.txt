                       Background on Labor Issues in Welfare Reform

Minimum Wage and Other Labor Protections
As states begin to put welfare recipients to work, a key question for the labor movement and for
the states is whether welfare recipients who take part in workfare or subsidized employment
programs are protected by labor laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. The most obvious
protection this law offers is payment of the minimum wage, but there are a host of other
protections (and costs to employers) that are connected: collective bargaining rights, taxation,
unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation.

We are in general agreement that these workers should be paid the minimum wage, but two
  . .             .
major Issues remam:

·      What streams of benefits should count toward the minimum wage?

·      Have we thought through the consequences of other rights and costs that appear to come
       along with the minimum wage, and how they would affect the success of welfare reform?

The Department of Labor and HHS believe that, as a legal matter, it is quite clear that the Fair
Labor Standards Act does apply to people in workfare and wage supplementation programs --
that essentially they are employees, with limited exceptions for "trainees." Labor and HHS
argue that this is not really a change in Federal policy, since they would argue that these rules
have generally applied to welfare waiver programs -- with the exception of AFDC workfare
programs, where the old law did explicitly permit states to ignore the Fair Labor Standards Act.

However, the scale of the coming welfare-to-work effort is so much larger than under previous
law that these requirements may still come as a shock to the states, and will raise affordability
questions that didn't exist in those smaller programs. Also, the focus on enforcement of these
laws will inevitably be much greater now than in the past.

Minimum Wage: One problem in requiring the minimum wage is that the existing welfare grant
in many states is too low to convert it into a minimum wage salary, even if the recipient is only
working 20 or 25 hours a week. Therefore, the question is whether to include in that calculation
a variety of other government benefits, such as food stamps, child care, housing assistance, and
transportation.

Legally, there is a strong argument that food stamps can be added to the basic welfare grant to
help support a minimum wage. However, even if the two grants are combined, several Southern
states will probably still come up short, especially for smaller families. The problem gets worse
as the minimum wage and the work requirements increase over time.

We would make it easier for states if we permitted them to count the value of other benefits, like
child care or transportation, toward the minimum wage. However, DOL believes the law does
                                                                           }!ex-Dwnp Conversion                em


not pennit this, unless those benefits are offered to all employees, not only those on welfare.
(States may be motivated to segregate workfare recipients in an effort to get around this
requirement.) In addition, counting in-kind assistance toward wages opens the door to counting
these benefits as income for the purposes of calculating TANF, food stamps, and SSI benefits,
which would generally reduce benefits.

Other Labor Protections: We are still in the process of sorting out what other requirements states
and employers would face if participants in workfare and subsidized employment programs are
considered employees under labor law. DOL's opinion is that most other standard labor
protections would apply, including OSHA, unemployment insurance, and anti-discrimination
laws.

The thorniest outstanding questions have to do with taxes and collective bargaining rights. We
have yet to hear from Treasury as to whether these wages or benefits would be subject to FICA
and other taxes, as well as eligible for the EITC. On collective bargaining, the National Labor
Relations Board will have to rule on the facts in individual situations, but it is likely they would
rule that these workers are eligible to unionize. There has been some recent media attention on
efforts to unionize workfare recipients in New York City, and there certainly would be more
attention if the ruling were made that these workers had the right to unionize.

We are working to resolve these issues in the next week or two. In addition, we are thinking
through our strategy on the Hill, given the likelihood of a backlash there once these
interpretations are known.

Privatization
A second issue concerns efforts by some states to privatize their welfare operations. Texas has
had a request pending at USDA and HHS for months that would outsource eligibility
detenninations for food stamps and Medicaid state-wide. Wisconsin has a more limited waiver
request pending. Current law requires these programs to use "merit systems" employees --
essentially government workers. However, we may be able to waive this requirement if we want
to. This is a major issue for unions with a large number of public sector employees (AFSCME
and SEIU) since it would lead to a direct loss of membership. Our analysis is not as far along
here. The unions are not pressing us for a decision, since they fear we will not rule entirely in
their favor. However, we can expect increasing pressure from Govs. Bush and Thompson.
