TEXT:·

A quick review by agency lawyers of the latest Hatfield language
we have (2/27/96) has identified the following problems with it:
REPLACEMENT TIMBER PROVISION:

o       carries sufficiency language for replacement timber sales;
o       prohibits us from using option 9 or salvage sales for
replacement timber;
o       makes replacement timber subject to agreement of purchaser;
o       allows purchasers to continue cutting even murrelet sa~es
until replacement timber is agreed to (this makes it WORSE than
the original language and could definitely undermine the Forest
Plan);
o       still carries 45 day requirement for agreement to identify
replacement timber (probably negotiable) .
BUYOUT PROVISIONS
o       amount of compensation subject to agremeent by purchaser

In short, we believe the Hatfield language doesn't give us the
administrative tools we need to address released sales consistent
with the administration's policies, and in some instances
(especially the murrelet sale problem) makes it worse.
