LOG CABIN VOWS TO 'DEFEAT HEFLEY AMENDMENT IN HOUSE

"A Critical Moment for the Republican Majority"


(WASHINGTON) The nation's largest gay Republican organization vowed to

muster as many Republican votes as possible to defeat an amendment
proposed

by Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO) which would roll back a recent executive
order

by President Clinton codifying a federal non-discrimination policy in
the

executive branch that sexual orientation must not be a consideration
in

employment practices for federal workers.


"We will fight the Hefley Amendment, and we will be watching every

Republican vote when it comes to the floor," said Richard Tafel,
executive

director of Log Cabin Republicans.   "There will not be a vote like this
one

in the House before the 1998 elections, and our entire membership will

mobil'ize to fight, its passage."


The amendment will be offered to the Treasury, Postal Service and
General

Government Appropriations bill, managed by subcommittee Chairman Jim
Kolbe

(R-AZ), who is openly gay and has announced his opposition to it.




     "In particular, this will be a test of how low the religious right
     will

     stoop, forcing a vote on a measure that is not only dangerous and
     wrong,

     but slapping the face of an Appropriations subcommittee chairman in
     the

     process in very personal terms," Tafel said.    "There seems to be no
     limit

     to what they will try anymore, and it is time to put an end to it."


     In a letter to House Republicans, Tafel called the vote on the Hefley

     Amendment as a "critical moment for the Republicans Majority."


     "I cannot forsee a more crucial vote to my organization and our
     membership

     in this Congress than this one," Tafel wrote.   "The time has come for
     moral

     leadership, if not from those elected to lead the Conference, then by
     the

     rank and file Members themselves.   Words and rhetoric about tolerance
     is

     not enough.   Indeed, there comes a time in every political leader's
     life

     when he or she can no longer pander to the lowest common denominator
     and

     must do what is right.   This is such a time for the House of

     Representatives."


     [FULL TEXT OF LETTER ATTACHED]


     Log Cabin Republicans is the nation's largest gay and lesbian
     Republican

     organization, with 50+ chapters nationwide, a full-time Washington
     office

     and a federal political action committee.




     TEXT OF LETTER TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS:




Dear Republican Members of the House:


I am writing to you in strong opposition to the Hefley Amendment,
which

will be offered by Rep. Joel Hefley of Colorado to the Treasury,
Postal

Service and General Government Appropriations bill.    I   will not mince
words

     this amendment is not only morally wrong and politically dangerous,
it

flatly contradicts the stated values of the Republican Party and is

designed merely to attack gay and lesbian Americans.       I urge you not
only

to vote against the amendment, but to speak in clear opposition to the

amendment among your colleagues and on the floor of the House of

Representatives.    I cannot forsee a more crucial vote to my
organization

and our membership in this Congress than this one; further, we view it
as a

critical moment for the Republican Majority.


You are well aware that Log Cabin Republicans has always been a
staunch

opponent of preferences and quotas and a defender of our shared
Republican

principles.   Over 70 Republican Members of the 105th Congress have

certified in writing that "sexual orientation is not a consideration in
the

hiring, firing and promoting practices" in their own Congressional
offices.

That is the core of the employment non-discrimination Executive Order

signed by President Clinton that the Hefley Amendment seeks to
overturn,

which added a provision to an Executive Order first enacted by
President

Richard Nixon in 1972 and codified what is already in practice in
every


federal agency today.     You will recall that in 1996, the Dole-Kemp
campaign

publicly pledged that a Dole-Kemp Administration would leave in place
all

non-discrimination policies in the executive branch which included gay
and

lesbian federal workers.       As a Party, we Republicans have prided
ourselves
                           .
in defending the principle that merit should be the sole criterion by
which

every American is judged in the workplace -- no discrimination, no

preferential treatment.    The Hefley Amendment would violate all of
these

principles in the most sweeping manner ever attempted in the history
of

United States Congress, and for reasons that are morally and
politically

wrong.


The purpose of this amendment is blatantly clear.       It is designed to
pander

to a narrow faction inside the Republican Party that cares nothing
about

our Majority and will stoop to any depth -- including the destruction
of

our Party -- to impose their extreme anti-gay views upon the GOP

leadership.   The so-called arguments in favor of the Hefley Amendment
are a

transparent veil that cannot cover the truth -- this intolerant faction
is

demanding that we make exceptions to the merit principle, that gay and

lesbian Americans must never be treated equally no matter how
meritorious

they may be as individuals.      The American people are not fooled.    They
can

see what is going on here.


The flurry of recent anti-gay comments by senior members of the

Congressional leadership have provoked alarm and serious concern among



Republicans all across .the country for a good reason -- these comments
and

actions are simply wrong -- morally, intellectually and politically
wrong.

Log Cabin Republicans has been labeled "perverts" and has been compared
to

pedophiles and the Ku Klux Klan by the leadership of the Texas
Republican

Party.   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has said that gay Americans

suffer from a disorder akin to kleptomania and drug addiction.     A
small

handful of Members in the Senate have grossly and unfairly attacked
the

character and reputation of the pending nominee for Ambassador to

Luxembourg, Mr. James Harmel, solely because he is gay.   Every poll
which

analyzes the problems facing the Republican Party at the ballot box
show a

consistent trend -- swing voters fear that our Party is controlled by
the

far right.


And now we have this dangerous and sweeping proposal in the Hefley

Amendment.   It will impact every office, every agency and every
department

of the executive branch.   Its reach goes far beyond the recent
Executive

Order. The time has come for moral leadership, if not from those
elected

to lead the Conference, then by the rank and file Members themselves.

Words and rhetoric about tolerance is not enough.   Indeed, there comes
a

time in every political leader's life when he or she can no longer
pander

to the lowest common denominator and must do what is right.   This is
such a

time for the House of Representatives.



    Sincerely,


    RICHARD L. TAFEL

    Executive Director
