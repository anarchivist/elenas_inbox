TEXT:
I'm working with Justice OPD on this idea.  I have them reviewing the
Arizona statute and getting ready to prepare options on what aspects of
lifetime parole/ supervised release are the most viable for sexual
predators.

If we are-going to do anything on this, it should be a part of the sexual
offenders announcement we were originally preparing to release: 1)
announcement that national sexual offender registry is up and running; and
2) directive to include sex offenders in federal and military prisoners in
the national registry database (right now, national registry is only
including the state prisoner info submitted by states) .

I will be working with Christa to figure out a date for a sex offenders
event that Rahm approves.  Once we have a firm date, I think it will help
me get Justice energized on it.  I will keep you updated.

whatever happened to Tom Freedman's idea about lifetime parole for sexual
predators? Is someone still looking into that? or has it died?
