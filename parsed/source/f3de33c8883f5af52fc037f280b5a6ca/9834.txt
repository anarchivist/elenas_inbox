TEXT:
As an ongoing part of the President's Race Initiative, the National
Conference for Community and Justice will be spearheading our efforts in
the faith community to continue the President's call for race and


  reconciliation.   Starting today,  they will hold 2 day summit to explore
  ways in which the faith community can continue to build on the
  President's work.   We have approximately 65 religious leaders from all
  walks of life committed and dedicated to the President's work at the White
  House Conference Center.   I had the opportunity to open up the conference
  and stay for the opening address.   We are indeed fortunate to have this
  group assembled!
  And, the work that they have set out to achieve will no doubt help our
  efforts.

  As a wrap-up of today's meetings and break-out sessions, we will be
  hosting a reception for the leaders in the Indian Treaty Room at 6:30
  p.m.  Please take time out of your already busy schedule to drop by and
  say hello to them.  Your presence will help reinforce how important this
  initiative is to the White House.

  If you need more details, don't hesitate to contact me or Jocelyn.   Thanks
