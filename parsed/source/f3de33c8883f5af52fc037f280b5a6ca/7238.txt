Q:   What is your response to the fact that Medicare is losing about $20 billion last year
     to the fraud, waste and simple errors?

A:   The Administration is proud of our record in fighting fraud and abuse and is
     committed to doing more. Any report that suggests any problem in this area does cause
     concern. It is important to note, however, that this report does not take into account
     many of the actions that the Department has taken on fraud and abuse.

     The Administration has a strong record of fighting fraud and abuse. In fact, since
     1993, we have assigned more federal prosecutors and FBI agents to fight health care
     fraud than ever before. In this time, convictions have gone up a full 240 percent
     and we have saved some $20 billion in health care claims. The
     Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation the President signed into law created -- for the first
     time ever -- a stable funding source to fight fraud and abuse. This law authorized
     our extremely successful Operation Restore Trust initiative, a nationwide program to
     fight abuse and fraud that has identified $23 for every one dollar invested in fines,
     recoveries, settlements, audit disallowances, and civil monetary penalties owed to the
     Federal Governmen.t.

     We welcome the Inspector General's report, but point out that it does not reflect
     numerous initiatives to fight waste and fraud that are underway or that the
     President has asked the Congress to pass. There are more than sixteen legislative or
     administrative actions that HCF A has taken that this report does not reflect. These include
     implementing the first ever home health moratorium, doubling the number of medical
     review audits, expanding on-site visits, tightening enrollment standards, and requiring
     home health agencies to post surety bonds. We have also proposed a number of new
     legislative initiatives to fight waste and abuse, such as doubling audits to ensure that
     Medicare only reimburses for appropriate provider costs and eliminating wasteful
     excessive Medicare reimbursement for drugs.

     Moreover, it is important to note that last year's report did not include a review of
     Durable Medical Equipment, an area that is fraught with waste and fraud. Despite
     the fact that this year's audit did include a review of this, the audit shows less fraud and
     waste than in last year's report.

     Our anti-waste and fraud efforts are already paying new dividends. Earlier this
     year, the Medicare actuary reported that the home health baseline spending has been
     reduced from 25 percent to 5.4 percent. These successes are at least partially attributable
     to our efforts.
