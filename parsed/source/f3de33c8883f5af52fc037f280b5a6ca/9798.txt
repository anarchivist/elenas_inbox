TEXT:
I'm trying to prepare a Native American budget win document for Lynn to
use at the National Congress of American Indian Conference.  OMB is still
looking it over, but I will get it to you to review this afternoon.   If
you could review it by 4:30pm today, I would appreciate it.   I'm leaving
this afternoon to go to the conference and would like to take it with
me.   I get it to you as soon as OMB gets back to me.  Thanks, Mary
