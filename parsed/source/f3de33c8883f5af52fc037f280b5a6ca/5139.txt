Tentatively Agreed-to Definition:
A "good cause domestic violence waiver" is defined in § 270.30 as one that is: "granted
appropriately based on need as determined by an individualized assessment; temporary, for a
period not to exceed six months [they can, however, be renewed]; and accompanied by an
appropriate services plan designed to provide safety and lead.to work."

Our Proposal:
The Secretary shall not grant reasonable cause exceptions to penalties to states that exempt more
than 20 percent of their caseload from the five year time limit due to the granting of good cause
domestic violence waivers.

Their Proposal
Adds these new sections regarding domestic violence and time limits:

Insert #1: "States must grant good cause domestic violence waivers appropriately, which, in the
context means there must be a need to exceed the time limit for a given family. We do not
expect that many such cases will arise; however, we recognize that there are instances where an
extension is necessary. For example, if a recipient suffers a recurrence of domestic violence
toward the end of the five-year period, the State must waive the time limit in order to provide the
services she now needs."

Insert #2: "A State must grant good cause domestic violence waivers appropriately, in
accordance with the criteria specified at §270.30. If a State fails to meet the criteria specified for
"good cause domestic violence waivers" specified at §270.30, the Secretary will not grant
reasonable cause under this paragraph."                              . .

A Possible Counter-Proposal
Option #1: Revise Insert #2 as follows:
"A State must grant good cause domestic violence waivers appropriately, in accordance with the
criteria specified at §270.30. The need for the waiver, as defined in §270.30, must specifically
apply to the need for a time limit extension; the Secretary will not automatically consider the
granting of a good cause domestic violence waiver for work participation to be sufficient grounds
for a time limit extension. If a State fails to meet the criteria specified for "good cause domestic
violence waivers" specified at §270.30, the Secretary will n()t grant reasonable cause under this
paragraph."

Option #2: Revise Insert #2 as follows:
"A State must grant good cause domestic violence waivers appropriately, in accordance with the
criteria specified at §270.30. The need for the waiver, as defined in §270.30, must specifically
apply to the need for a time limit extension; the Secretary will not automatically consider the
granting of a good cause domestic violence waiver for work participation to be sufficient grounds
for a time limit extension. Because the Secretary does not expect many such cases to arise, she
will not grant reasonable cause under this paragraph for more than 20 percent of the good cause
domestic violence waivers granted by the State for work participation, and she will not grant
reasonable cause for waivers lif a State fails to meet the criteria specified for "good cause
domestic violence waivers" specified at §270.30, the Seeretary will not gnmt reasonable eause
under this paragraph. "
