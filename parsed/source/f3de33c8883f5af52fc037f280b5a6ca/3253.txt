 Elena:

 Here's the crack memo, reworked slightly. Also, I left a message that
 Kent was having problems changing the "crack stabilization" bullet.     He
 could get "outdated dispartiy .. " in, but not get the other stuff dropped
 with ONDCP reaching out to the General on the road.    Frankly, at this
 point, maybe we should just go with that.

                  DRAFT #1-10: 1 CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATION

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               ELENA KAGAN

RE:    CRACK AND POWDER COCAINE SENTENCING RECOMMENDAnONS

        On April 29th, the U.S. Sentencing Commission submitted a report to Congress with
revised recommendations concerning the current sentencing policy for trafficking in crack and
powder cocaine. In response to this report, you directed the Attorney General and ONDCP
Director to review the report and make recommendations to you within the next 60 days. They
have submitted the following recommendation: that the threshold for a 5-year mandatory
sentence for trafficking be increased from 5 grams to 25 grams for crack cocaine, and reduced
from 500 grams to 250 grams for powder cocaine. Such a change would reduce the current
disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences from a ratio of 100: 1 to 10: 1.


I. BACKGROUND

        Under current law, a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence applies to a person selling 5
grams of crack cocaine, or 500 grams of powder cocaine. This disparity is often referred to as
the "1 OO-to-l " ratio between crack and powder cocaine sentences. This means that a person
convicted of selling 500 grams of powder cocaine, worth approximately $30,000, is subject to the
same five-year mandatory minimum sentence as a person selling 5 grams of crack cocaine, which
is worth about $300. The only exception to these mandatory minimum drug penalties is the
so-called "safety valve" that allows certain first-time, non-violent drug offenders to receive a
lesser sentence. Thousands of defendants have been eligible for this exception since its
enactment as part of the 1994 crime bill.

       In May 1995, the Sentencing Commission, by a 4-3 vote, sent to Congress proposed
changes to the sentencing guidelines reducing crack cocaine penalties so that there would be no
disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences -- a 1: 1 ratio at 500 grams. The
Administration proposed and Congress passed legislation rejecting this recommendation. As a
result of this legislation, which you signed into law in October of 1995, the Commission was
directed to submit new recommendations that acknowledged that crack penalties should
generally exceed sentences for like amounts of powder cocaine.

       The Sentencing Commission's revised recommendations suggested ranges for the
amounts of crack and powder cocaine that should trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum
sentence for drug trafficking: the threshold should be increased from 5 grams to somewhere
between 25 and 75 grams for crack cocaine, and reduced from 500 grams to somewhere between
125 and 375 grams for powder cocaine.
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

II. JUSTICE AND ONDCP RECOMMENDATION

       After reviewing the Sentencing Commission's revised report, the Attorney General and
ONDCP Director are recommending that the Administration support and work with Congress to
reduce the disparity between the triggering amounts of crack and powder cocaine for 5-year
mandatory sentences from 5 grams of crack and 500 grams of powder, to 25 grams of crack and
250 grams of powder cocaine.

       The Attorney General and ONDCP Director believe that this revised structure will help
ensure that federal prosecutors target mid- and high-level cocaine traffickers, generally leaving
lower-level traffickers and users to be prosecuted by state and local law enforcement. They
contend that this "division of responsibility" for prosecuting drug cases is sensible: the federal .
government is better situated to target and dismantle major drug trafficking organizations
through its powerful enforcement tools, such as the RICO statute, wiretapping authority and its
national and international enforcement programs.

        They also argue that the current sentencing structure creates an incentive to concentrate
on lower level street dealers since sales of 5 grams of crack can still result in a long mandatory
sentence. A mid-level crack dealer, however, typically deals in ounce (28 grams) or multi-ounce
quantities. By directing resources toward lower-level dealers, otherwise scarce federal law
enforcement resource could be diverted away from higher priority, serious drug traffickers.

        In addition, the Attorney General and ONDCP Director make the case that the current
100: 1 sentencing scheme has become a symbol of racial bias in the criminal justice system for
many African Americans. Thus, reducing the disparity from 100: 1 to 10: I is not only good law
enforcement, it will also help address this concern.


III. RECOMMENDATION

        We recommend that you endorse the recommendation submitted by the Attorney General
and the ONDCP Director, and encourage them to work with Congress to address this matter.
We believe t~at the proposed 10: 1 ratio, which triggers 5-year mandatory drug penalties at 25
grams of crack cocaine and 250 grams of powder cocaine, is fundamentally sound. In addition
to significantly reducing the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences -- while
preserving the Congressionally mandated policy of tougher penalties for crack -- this
recommendation makes the most sense from a law enforcement perspective. It links the increase
in the threshold for mandatory crack penalties (25 grams) to an amount that corresponds with the
practice of mid-level crack dealers to traffick in ounce (28 grams) or multi-ounce quantities.

        Despite concurring with this recommendation, we are not optimistic that the Attorney
General and ONDCP Director will have much success in persuading Members of Congress to
pass such legislation any time soon. In fact, it is very likely that the Administration's call for
legislation to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine penalties will lead to
congressional action to simply increase the penalties for powder cocaine violations. For
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
instance, Senators Abraham and Hatch have proposed legislation to keep the current threshold
for crack penalties at 5 grams while dropping the threshold for powder cocaine violations from
500 grams to 100 grams -- and are considering offering it as an amendment to the juvenile crime
bill. Other members have proposed dropping the powder cocaine threshold to as low as 5
grams. As you know, addressing the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences in
this manner will increase the federal government's role in low-level drug cases that are best
addressed by state and local law enforcement -- as well as add billions of dollars to the federal
prison budget.

       Thus, if you concur with this recommendation, we should make it available to concerned
Members of Congress and ask the Attorney General and ONDCP Director to follow-up with
them immediately.
