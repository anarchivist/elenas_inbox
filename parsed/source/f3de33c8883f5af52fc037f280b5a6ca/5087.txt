    Bruce said he wants to hold the reg and announce both it and the TANF reg
    Nov. 17th in Wichita and that I should continue to give DOL a hard time
    about targetting but that he doesn't feel all that strongly about it.

    Subject:         Two Decision I need ASAP re: DOL Regs

    1) Timing: Do we want to hold the DOL reg until the TANF reg is done? To
    meet the statutory deadline, DOL has to send the reg to the federal
    register tomorrow (I think we at a minimum should postpone until Monday,
    to give us a chance to check the changes). Bruce -- you expressed
    interest in holding it until the TANF reg was ready, which I would say
    from our meeting with HHS today, will rea1is'ti'cally about two weeks. Do
    you want me to hold the DOL reg?
    I imagine Herman will be quite unhappy, but I agree with you that
    releasing both regs at once will be more newsworthy.

    2) Individuals Served by the Program: As you know, we argued throughout
    the budget negotiations that we needed $3 billion for welfare to work in
    order to ensure that the hardest to employ people in high poverty/high
    unemployment areas would be served. At the same time we argued that PICs s
    hould have the maximum possible flexibility in deciding how to spend the
    funds to get these individuals into jobs.

    The statute says that 70 percent of funds must be spent on individuals
    with certain characteristics. They must have been on welfare for 30 months
    or be within 12 months of losing eligibility and they must have two of the
    following three characteristics:

               1) not completed high school and has low reading and math skills
               2) requires substance abuse for treatment
               3) have a poor work history


DOL wants to leave these definitions to the states and PICs. HHS
adamantly disagrees, saying that the vast majority of welfare recipients
could meet a loose definition of these terms.

Our idea {Parker-Matlack-Ricel would be to define "low skills in reading
and mathematics" as at or below the 8th grade level and give states and
PICs the following options re: "poor work history":

                -   Option #1: has worked for less than 3 of the last 12
months
                -   Option #2: has worked for less than 6 of the last 24
months;
                - Option #3: if neither of the first two were
satisfactory, the PIC or state
                        could propose another definition to DOL;
