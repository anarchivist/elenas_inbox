TEXT:
Bruce/Elena:    As you know, the VP is scheduled to do an anti-smoking on

Thursday, national smoke-out day.      Because of the intense criticism the

state deal is getting from the health groups, on the one hand, and the

sense that we have endorsed it, on the other, I am concerned about making

sure we are all in sync he for this event.



Because I am only going to be in for a few hours today and Wednesday,    I'd

appreciate if you guys could work with Pat Ewing on some language for

this.     I assume it would suggest WH neutrality on whether states should

opt-in!opt-out of the deal, combined with a sharp point about how the deal

does not protect teens, do FDA, etc.



Thanks.
