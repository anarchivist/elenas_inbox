TEXT:
FYI, there is one line about welfare reform in remarks POTUS is taping for
NACO meeting. on 7/19. With my edits, it says:
"We're addressing the challenges of moving people from welfare to work,
many of which are outlined in the study NACO is releasing at this
conference. "

NACO's study called "Is Welfare Reform Working: A Study of the Changing
Welfare System in Counties" is a follow-up on welfare reform in the four
areas where NACO conducted hearings in 1997 (Fulton Co, GA;
Hennepin/Ramsey Cos, MN; Santa Clara Co, CA; Dade Co, FL).    They also sent
a questionnaire to 85 other counties.    The basic message is
constructive: "NACO is committed to making welfare reform work", ... there
are many positive signs (caseload reductions, new partnerships), but there
is much more to learn about long-term effects.   The report applauds
restoration of SSI and food stamps, and Access to Jobs, but raises
concerns about congressional attempts to cut TANF.

Recommendations (I've asked HHS and DOL to take a look at these):
Eliminate separate participation rate for two-parent families, or at least
eliminate 90% requirement.
Ease match requirement for Welfare-to-Work formula grants--prefer ATJ
model which allows using other federal funds as match.  (They indicate
that match issue is why some states have turned down formula grants) .
Counties in states that reject formula grants should be allowed to access
funds directly.
Give states and counties additional funds and technical assistance to
monitor effect of welfare reform on other systems and to track families
once they leave welfare.

Key Points:
Counties who responded to survey said the largest percentage of
individuals who have left the welfare rolls have done so for full-time
employment in the private sector, and the majority have remain employed
for at least 6 months.   (The actual data are rather odd--I'm trying to get
some clarification from NACO) .
Counties expect to meet all family participation rates for now, but worry


about two-parent rates and continuing success once they get to harder
cases.
Too early to tell long-term effects; counties are just beginning to track
what happens to people; time limits not yet a major factor.  Some evidence
of increased use of food banks attributed to ABAWD and legal immigrant
provisions.
Collaboration is most consistent theme--with Chambers, neighboring
jurisdictions, CBOs, businesses, faith community, foundations.
CA, CO, MD, NC, OH and WI are providing additional flexibility to counties
While most counties expect to meet current child care demand, they
anticipate shortages in the future. NYC anticipates need to add 30,000
slots over next few years to respond to increased work by TANF families
and working families, at estimated cost of $150 M by 2001. Biggest need
is infant care, along with care for off-peak hours and special needs
children.

 The report also highlights some interesting innovations in several areas.
For example, Santa Clara has a "JobKeeper: 24 hours Job Support Hotline"
to help people resolve crises such as child care and transportation.
Monterey County has developed a continuum of intensive substance abuse
services for people moving from welfare to work. The Full Employment
Council in Kansas City will provide a voucher worth up to $1,800 to
repair or buy a car, housing car insurance, continuing education, work
tools/clothes, or substance abuse treatment for people who retain their
jobs for at least nine months
