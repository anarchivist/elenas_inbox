Education Standards

Question:   You proposed national tests in reading and math in your State of the Union
            address. Yet the tests are not required, and you proposed no new funding to
            help students pass these tests. Why do you think these tests will make a
            difference?

Answer:     These tests reflect widely accepted national standards for 4th grade reading and
            8th grade math. The standards are higher than those in many states, which means
            they will lead to higher expectations for our students. The tests exist already, but
            are only given to a small sample of students at anyone time. My plan is to make
            those tests available for every state so they can be given to every 4th and 8th grade
            student. Then students, parents and teachers will know how they measure up
            against tough national standards.

            My balanced budget plan provides significant increases for federal elementary and
            secondary school programs that will help prepare students to meet these tougher
            standards, including significant increases for Goals 2000, Title 1, teacher training,
            charter schools, and my Technology Literacy Challenge fund. I've also proposed
            an America Reads Challenge, to mobilize an army of 1 million volunteer tutors, to
            help students read by the third grade. All of these programs help improve
            teaching and learning in the classroom.

            The point of these tests is to lift our students up, by setting a high standard for
            them, and then preparing them to meet the standards. Federal funds are
            important here. So are funds provided by states and local governments, which
            make up 94% of spending for schools. But these national tests will require a
            national response, from every school, every teacher, every parent and every
            student.

            Finally, I am pleased at the response this testing proposal has already received.
            Two weeks ago I spoke in Maryland, and the President of the State Board of
            Education announced that Maryland would participate in these tests. Just this
            morning, the Washington Post carried an endorsement of this plan from two
            former Republican assistant secretaries of education [Diane Ravitch and Checker
            Finn]. So we are beginning to move forward on this plan, and these tests will
            make a real difference.
