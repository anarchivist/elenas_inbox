TEXT:
FYI from Clay Shaw.  So far, I haven't seen anything suggesting that we've
provoked the Republican leadership on the children's SSI regulation we did.

(By the way, I also hear that the Wall St. Journal may be doing a story on
the inside debate on this issue.)

Subject: House Ways and Means Hearing

I was at the Human Resource Subcommittee hearing today because Carolyn
Colvin and Olivia Golden were testifying on the President's Budget
proposals     and Chairman Clay Shaw publicly praised the SSA Childhood
Disability rules.

From his written remarks:
"I want to congratulate the Administration on publishing these
regulations. They will serve the goal of ensuring that only truly
disabled children receive SSI benefits ... I think SSA did a good job of
implementing the intent of the law we passed last year."
