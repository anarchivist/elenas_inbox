    National Testing: Friday night the House passed the Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill, which
    included a compromise on national testing that we worked out with Mr. Goodling. The
    compromise allows test development to proceed under NAG8's control, prohibits pilot testing of
    the test items and field testing of the tests, as well as test implementation, during FY98. It also
    contains Goodling's National Academy of Science feasibility study to determine of existing state
    and commercially available tests can be linked to NAEP and to each other, as well as two
    addition NAS studies on the technical quality of the test items, and on a set of test use and misuse
    issues of concern to the Black and Hispanic Caucuses.

    Pilot testing is now scheduled for the Fall of 1998; the tests will be field tested in the Spring of
    1999 and will be ready for implementation in Spring of 2000.

    Charter Schools: On Friday the House also passed charter schools legislation that you had
    previously endorsed. The bill provides incentives to states to issue more charters, to provide
    charter schools with greater flexibility coupled with strengthened accountability, and to ensure
    that charter schools receive a fair share of state funding. In addition, the Education Department
    sponsored a national charter schools conference that drew over 800 participants, including
    charter schools operators, teachers, and others associated with the charter schools movement.
    The conference gave participants the opportunity to become familiar with Education Department
    resources, to share lessons and strategies with each other, and to provide advice to the Education
    Department on the implementation of the Charter Schools program.


    Vouchers/CoverdeU: Earlier this week, the House defeated a bill which would have permitted
    local school districts to use Chapter 2 block grant funds for vouchers for low income students.
    The vote was 228 to 191, with 35 Republicans voting against the bill. In the Senate, proponents
    of the Coverdell proposal to permit tax-fee IRA's for K-12 education were unable to end a
    filibuster for the second time. The vote was 56-44.
