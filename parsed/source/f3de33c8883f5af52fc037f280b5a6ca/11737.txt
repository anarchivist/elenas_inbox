TEXT:
On Tuesday, Bob Bach of INS   is briefing me on the INS interior enforcement
strategy that was the focus   of the Washington Post article today.   Bob
has assured me that the INS   strategy is an effort to increase all interior
enforcement and not to take   away from one area of interior enforcement at
the expense of another area   but I will let you know what I learn from the
briefing.
Let me know if you have any   questions. Thanks.
