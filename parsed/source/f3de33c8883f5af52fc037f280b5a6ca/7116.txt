Sally would like to have the nextNEC/DPC privacy meeting

1.   Legislative options (we didn't really get to this)

2.   ·Agency reaction to "privacy entity"

3.   Analysis of "self-regulatory" approach

4.  What we can do to get our own house in order
(federal privacy principles)

Is this O.K. with you?
