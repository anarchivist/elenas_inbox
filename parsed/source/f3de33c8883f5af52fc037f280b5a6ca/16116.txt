DRAFT NOT FOR RELEASE

H.R. 1818 - Juvenile Crime Control and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1997
(Riggs (R) California and 11 cosponsors)

Enactment of comprehensive legislation to address youth and gang violence
and drug use is a top Administration priority. Accordingly, on February
25, 1997, the Department of Justice transmitted to Congress the "Anti-Gang
and Youth Violence Act of 1997," which was introduced as H.R. 810 by
Representative Schumer. The Administration's proposal was designed to
combine elements of enforcement and prosecution with targeted and
selective prevention and intervention efforts. H.R. 1818 appropriately
addresses these prevention and intervention efforts.  Therefore, the
Administration supports House passage of H.R.· 1818.

In particular, the Administration supports the provisions of H.R. 1818
that:

 Restructure the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to
enhance its ability to support State and local delinquency control, system
improvement, and prevention programs;

 Continue the basic Formula Grants program to States, while providing
additional flexibility to State and local governments implementing
requirements that ensure the safety of and fairness to juveniles in their
custody;
  ,                                                                         Page 5 of5


 Consolidate several existing grant programs into a flexible delinquency
prevention and early intervention block grant program;

 Provide Federal support for research, evaluation, and statistics tied to
the programs of the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of
Justice Statistics; and

 Authorize technical assistance and training, information collection and
dissemination, and development, testing, and demonstration of programs
that have potential to control, reduce, or prevent juvenile crime.

The Administration will seek an amendment to H.R. 1818 to delete the
provision repealing the Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention.  The Council has helped to redefine the Federal
juvenile justice agenda and enhance Federal program coordination.
