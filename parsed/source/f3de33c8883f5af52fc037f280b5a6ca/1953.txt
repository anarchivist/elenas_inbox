TEXT:
Martha Foley said John Hilley is interested in accepting a House Women's
Caucus proposal to help win favor for a potential budget deal.  The
proposal would exempt families with grandparent and other non-parental
family caregivers from the TANF work requirements and time limits
established by welfare reform.  States that did not do so could be
penalized up to 5% of their block grant.  Additional block grant funds
would be provided to states to keep these families on the rolls after the
five year time limit.

As you know, the law now allows states to exempt up to 20% of families
from the time limits and to choose which families must work to meet the
participation rates.  In the last Congress, Republicans fought against
Democratic efforts to exempt particular categories of people (i.e.,
elderly, disabled) and pushed for a straight percentage exemption.

We could push for this option to please the Caucus knowing we will not
succeed. But I think that's dangerous because other groups (battered
women's and disabled advocates) will be mad at us for pushing an exception
for grandparents and not others.
