TEXT:
I hear from Waxman's folks that Roll Call will run a story tomorrow with
the results of a Lung Assoc. sting operation of 15 year olds who tried to
purchase cigarettes at stores located in the House, Senate, and the
Capitol. The tries were 100% successful in the House, 50% in the Capitol,
and 25% in the Senate.

FYI    I checked and the snack shop in the OEOB does sell cigarettes
($3.00 a pack) .
