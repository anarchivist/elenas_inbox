Subject: Justice letter opposing HR 1252 - Judicial Reform Act

A House Judiciary subcommittee is scheduled to markup HR 1252 tomorrow -
June lOth.  In clearance is a Justice letter opposing several provisions
in the bill including     (1) three judge court for certain injunctions;
(2) proceedings on complaints against judicial conduct; and (3) limitation
on court imposed taxes.

Justice is going to add a sentence to the letter opposing the bill in its
entirety.

I need your comments or sign-off on the Justice letter ASAP - they need to
get the letter signed and up to the Hill before the markup tomorrow.

Thanks
