Background

On Saturday, June 7, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) is expected to
complete its review of cloning issues. In its draft final report, NBAC concludes that it is morally
unacceptable for anyone to attempt to create a child using the technology that created Dolly the
sheep. NBAC also concludes, however, that the cloning of DNA sequences, cell lines, and
tissues (which do not involve the creation of entire human beings) are scientifically important
and not ethically problematic. NBAC chose not to address the creation of embryos; its draft
report neither sanctions nor condemns the cloning of embryos.

NBAC's draft final report calls for carefully-worded legislation prohibiting anyone from
"attempting to create a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques." The
Commission recommends a sunset provision and further review of the issues by an oversight
body prior to the sunset date. The Commission will vote on this recommendation at its public
meeting Saturday, and the President is scheduled to announce legislation implementing NBAC's
proposal in a White House ceremony Monday, June 9th.

TALKING POINTS

o      On Saturday, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission is scheduled to conclude its
       review of the ethical and scientific issues raised by possible human cloning. The
       President expects to receive NBAC's final report soon. We look forward to receiving
       and reviewing the Commissions recommendations.

Q.     The Washington Post reported Wednesday that NBAC will recommend a legislative
       ban on creating a child through cloning but that the proposed ban won't cover the
       creation of embryos using this technology. Where does the President stand? Does
       he think we should allow cloned embryos?

A.     The President is very concerned about using this new technology 'to clone human beings.
        He is deeply troubled by the prospect that it might someday be possible to create a child
       from one's own genetic material. That is why he asked NBAC to review the issue.

       The question of creating embryos for research -- as opposed to creating a child -- is a
       separate question that raises distinct scientific and ethical issues. The President has
       already acted in this area. In 1994 he directed the National Institutes of Health not to
       fund the creation of human embryos for research purposes. Congress has also placed
       restrictions on the use of federal funds for embryo research.

       As you know, NBAC has not issued its final report, and the President has not yet
       reviewed their recommendations. We will have more to say about it after he has·
       reviewed it.
