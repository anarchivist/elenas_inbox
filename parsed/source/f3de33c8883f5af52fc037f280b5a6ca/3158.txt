       TEXT:
       The press office indicated that Bob Nash is currenlty working on a
       response to the Jake Steinfeld/Flo Jo issue regarding the President's
       Council on Physical Fitness. They will presumably have a response prior
       to the 2pm briefing by McCurry in NYC, and I will get back to you with
       that response.

       Thank you.
