TEXT:
Ellen Lovell wants to include us more in the millenium project.  She
seemed particularly eager for someone to take part in a symposium put on
by Getty or some such in late April on non-profits. I can't go.   I
wondered if either one of you were interested, both on the forum and on
the milennium question. As the President likes to say, it only happens
once every thousand years.
