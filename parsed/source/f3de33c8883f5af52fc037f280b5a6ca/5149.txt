TEXT:
Gomperts says that none of our options for packaging the Points of Light
awards would persuade Bush to support AmeriCorps reauthorization in a
trade before Thursday. He says that Bush has been slowly becoming more
supportive of AmeriCorps, and a continuing lovefest might persuade him to
do something in the future, but that it wouldn't work to approach them for
a trade at this point. He also notes that the Bush people are annoyed
that it has taken us so long to agree to this.

So I assume this answer implies that we should stick with Option 3.           Phil,
let us know how you want us to get this answer to the President.

By the way, Harris wants Erskine to call Bush to tell him this.           Bibb, we
need to do talking points for him.
