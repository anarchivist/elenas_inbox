TEXT:
I will fax you each copies of the two letters:

        1) One Shalala wants to send to governors of states which do not
yet have a certified computer system saying statewide systems are crucial
and by law HHS must withold all federal funds to states that do not meet
have them in place by October 1.

        2) One from Monahan to the California child support enforcement
director saying we do not intend to modify our current regulations,
practice or policy to allow California to have a child sUPP9rt computer
system that is not statewide, unless, as currently allowed, the
alternative would function as well as a statewide system and meet all the
current statutory requirements.

please let me know if you have any comments.
