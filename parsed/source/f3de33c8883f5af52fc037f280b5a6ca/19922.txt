Bruce/Elena/Rahm/Cynthia:

The Cops/Tobacco meeting is set for Monday at 3pm in the Roosevelt Room.
With one or two exceptions, all of the major law enforcement groups have
confirmed their attendance.  please note that we decided to invite all of
the groups, even the naysayers, and that we expect the FOP to attend.  See
the attached list for details.

Treasury participants will include Neal Wolin of Treasury Counsel, ATF
Director John McGaw, Acting Deputy Customs Commissioner Doug Browning and
either Asst. Secretary for Enforcement Jim Johnson or his DAS John
Simpson. And I expect the key White House staff attending to include
Rahm, Cynthia and me.  Bruce/EK: any chance either of you will make it?
Should we get any other key players there?

Also, Cynthia R., can you and Neal (and whomever else) connect this
weekend/Monday morning on what the agenda/role of speakers should be.  I'm
not confident that all of the Treasury types are talking to each other
about this.  Maybe they or we should pre-meet for a few minutes beforehand?

Finally, Cynthia D. will circulate bye-mail a hand-out she and Treasury
worked up on the smuggling issue.  If there are no concerns with this
draft, we intend to circulate this to the law enforcement folks on Monday.
