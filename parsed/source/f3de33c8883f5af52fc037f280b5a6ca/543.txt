TEXT:
Katie McGinty has asked me to shepard a proposal to provide estate tax relief to
landowners willing to provide conservation easements.   I agree with the concept
because it would provide a "carrot" for protecting endangered species and other
valuable land uses.  Cost and other issues (like who would hold the easement)
would need to be fully discussed before we could go forward.
Would you like to talk this through before I agree to take it on?
