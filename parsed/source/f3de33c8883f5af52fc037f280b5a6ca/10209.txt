Shih'12/1/98
PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
STATEMENT AFTER CONGRESSIONAL MEETING
THE WHITE HOUSE
DECEMBER 2, 1998

        Good Morning.  As the Vice-President and Senator Daschle said, we
have just a had a very productive discussion about our agenda for the new
Congress.

        This is a remarkable moment in the history of America. With the
strongest economy in a generation, we have the means to tackle the
challenges before us.  And as we saw in this last election, we have also
found the will.  From education to social security to health care, the
American people have reached a strong consensus for action.  They have
made it very clear to their leaders in Washington that they want us to get
to work on the issues that matter most in their lives -- modern schools
and world-class educations for their children, a sound social security
system for the 21st Century, and strong patient protections in this era of
managed health care.
·

            And that is why Senator Daschle, his colleagues and I are
    determined to make the passage of a comprehensive PatientsD, Bill of
    Rights a key priority next year. We must give Americans the peace of mind
    that comes from knowing that when they fall ill, they will be treated as
    people, not dollar signs on a ledger book.   I have taken all the steps
    within my power as President to strengthen patient protections.    Just
    this week, my Administration informed hospitals across America that they
    must provide emergency care to those who need it and may not deny service
    while waiting for approval from an insurance company. But now the time
    has come for Congress must do its part to protect AmericaD,s patients.
    with Sen. Daschle and his colleagues leading the way, we must work
    together across party lines to make the PatientsD, Bill of Rights law.
    Protecting patients isnD,t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue.
    Protecting patients is an American issue ..

            Thirty days ago, the American people gave all of us in Washington
    our marching orders: They want us to get to work on their behalf and on
    their business. We Democrats have heard them loud and clear. And we will
    work with colleagues of good faith across party lines to create a new
    season of achievement for the American people.
