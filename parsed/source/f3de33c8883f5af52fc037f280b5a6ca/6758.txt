     TEXT:
     This bill is on the House Suspension Calendar for next Tuesday.  It was
     previously circulated to most of you, as well as the Departments of
     Transportation and Justice, for commen~ on March 9th.  Both Departments
     responded that they had no objection to the bill, and there were no
     internal objections.  In keeping with the Department of Transportation's
     wishes on the bill (they do not object to enactment of the bill, but view
     most of its requirements as unnecessary), we plan to communicate an
     informal "no objection" to the bill via LA.

     The chief provision of the bill is a "good samaritan" provision limiting
     the liability of individuals "providing or attempting to provide
     assistance in the case of an in-flight medical emergency." Such persons
     would be liable, however, if "guilty of gross negligence or willful
     misconduct" "while rendering such assistance." There is also a limited
     exclusion for air carriers for "obtaining or attempting to obtain the
     assistance of a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency, or out of the
     acts or omissions of the passenger rendering the assistance if the
     passenger is not an employee or agent of the carrier and the carrier in
'"
     good faith believes that the passenger is a medically qualified
     individual."

     Other provisions of the bill require the Department to reevaluate current
     requirements regarding medical equipment maintained at airports and on
     aircraft operated by passenger air carriers.

       It excluding "medically qualified individuals" who are "not agents or
     employees
