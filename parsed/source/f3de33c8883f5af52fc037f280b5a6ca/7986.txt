                                         A Step Backward
                                              June 4,1998

President Clinton's successful economic plan has restored fiscal discipline to Washington while investing
more in our people. In 1993, President Clinton inherited a budget deficit of $290 billion; thanks to two
landmark budget packages, this year President Clinton will deliver a budget in surplus for the first time since
1969. The President's 1999 budget advances the successful strategy of fiscal discipline, coupled with strategic
investments in education, health, and the environment.
. The House Republican budget repeats the failed strategies of 1995 and the 1980's -- promising cuts that
  are unfair and unrealistic. Once again, the House Republicans in their May 12th detailed document
  proposed to eliminate major parts of the Medicaid guarantee, for example. Faced with fierce bipartisan
  opposition to the detailed cuts, House Republicans decided to hide aU specifics and rely on vague and
  unrealistic cuts of the same magnitude. Noting this return to "Stockman-like tactics" when budgets
  assumed unrealistic unspecified savings that never materialized, the New York Times said the House
  GOP budget "fails the basic integrity test, and the House should vote it down, demanding instead a
  budget that is real, not rigged." [NYT, 6/1/98.]
The House Republican budget resolution opens the door to using part of the surplus for tax cuts before
comprehensive bipartisan Social Security strengthening legislation is adopted. President Clinton is
determined to reserve aU surpluses to save Social Security first.

THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN BUDGET:
·   Includes $125 billion in cuts over five years radically departing from the bipartisan balanced budget
    agreement oflast year and posing a threat to Medicare, Medicaid, education, Unemployment Insurance
    benefits, veterans benefits, law enforcement, and environmental protection.
·   Deep cuts in Medicaid or Children's Health -- Last year's balanced budget agreement reduced
    Medicaid per capita growth to below that of the private sector. This additional $12 billion proposed
    cut unnecessarily reduces health benefits for poor families, seniors and people with disabilities too
    deeply and threatens the critical children's health expansion.
·   Medicare remains at risk -- The Committee budget included a $10 billion cut in Medicare that has been
    heavily criticized on a bipartisan basis. To deflect criticism, the Republicans adjusted non-binding budget
    function totals to make it appear that Medicare would be spared. Not so. The House Republican budget
    still includes an instruction for the Ways and Means Committee to save $13 billion over five years. A
    possible target is Medicare that, after Social Security, is the largest program under the Committee's
    jurisdiction.
·   New and misguided targets for cuts -- Other targets for savings to come from the Ways and Means
    Committee are Unemployment Insurance, child care and temporary aid to mothers and children on welfare,
    the block grant created by welfare reform in 1996.
·   Would mean a 14% cut in 2003 in the portion of the budget that funds critical programs in education,
    health, environmental protection, and law enforcement -- The House Republican budget advertises
    $46 billion in nondefense discretionary cuts below the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. Incorporating
    the new transportation bill pushes this cut up to $70 billion. Compared to the President's budget, this
    implies a 14% cut in 2003 in outlays. If this were done across the board, this would:
       ·   Deny Head'Start to 85,000 children in 2003, including 40,000 children in Early Head Start.
       ·   Deny PeU grants to 140,000 low-income students in 2003. Existing grants would be slashed by
           $300 each ..
       ·   Deny support to 400 school districts for Safe and Drug-free Schools in 2003.
                                                             .     Hex-Dump Conversion
        ·   'Undermine food safety by slashing by up to 1,000 meat and poultry inspectors in 2003. This
             budget would also create major delays in the drive to modernize the federal inspection system,
             including upgraded lab testing for harmful pathogens in the food supply.
        ·   Threaten public health by reducing funding for the Centers for Disease Control by more than
            $340 million in 2003, cutting childhood immunization funding and reducing funds for breast
            and cervical cancer screening.
        ·   Deny assistance to low-income students. In 2003, more than one million students in our
            poorest communities would be denied services from Title 1 educational programs.
        ·   Eliminate training initiatives for at least 178,000 dislocated workers in 2003.
        ·   Hamper efforts to protect the environment, by slashing funds by 14 percent in 2003 for
            initiatives to combat climate change, designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cut energy
            usage, and save consumers' money. It also jeopardizes the safety of drinking water and food
            supply by cutting funds meant to clean up factory farm pollution.
        ·   Delay environmental cleanup, jeopardizing public health by halting funding for the clean up of
            some Superfund sites.

·       Additional cuts in veterans programs -- Within the highway bill, the Congress has already passed
        the veterans savings that were assumed in the House Republican budget. Their budget, however, still
        instructs the Veterans Affairs Committee to come up with $10 billion in savings. This $10 billion in
        cuts in Veterans benefit programs would be cut beyond what is already in the highway bill.
·       Completely ignores the need for comprehensive tobacco legislation. By failing to facilitate tobacco
        legislation, as the Senate budget resolution does, the House Republican puts procedural roadblocks in
        the way of this critical bipartisan legislation.
·       A $24 billion black hole -- The Republicans are advertising $101 billion in cuts. However, since they
        refuse to incorporate the transportation bill into their budget, as well as the agricultural research bill, an
        additional $24 billion in cuts would be required.

House Democrats are offering a superior alternative, that:
    _ Protects the surplus consistent with the President's strategy of saving Social Security first.
    _ Rejects Republican cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment.
    _   Includes critical Presidential initiatives including a major effort to reduce class size by hiring new
        elementary school teachers, allowing Medicare buy-in for 62 year olds, an investment in making child
        care more affordable for working families, food stamps benefits for legal immigrants, and children's
        health.
    _   Like the President's budget, includes a fully paid for tax cut to spur school construction and make
        child care more affordable for working families.
    _   Invests in key priorities. Over five years, compared to the misguided Republican budget, the
        Democratic alternative invests (all outlays, discretionary spending):
        ·   $6.9 billion more in education.
        ·   $7.5 billion more in the environmental protection function.
        ·   $5.8 billion more in law enforcement.
        Facilitates comprehensive tobacco legislation through the creation of a reserve fund.
