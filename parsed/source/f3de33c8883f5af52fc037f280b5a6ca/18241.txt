Elena,

I have several big picture things that I need to talk to you about
regarding the Race Initiative. I am going to be around most of the day
tomorrow (Wed.) and will be available over the week-end (though moving to
our new place on Friday, believe it or not). Of course, feel free to call
me at home I P6/(b)(6) I or at Avner 's I P6/(b)(6) I to set something up. rOO   IJ
Thanks.                                                                    U

Julie
