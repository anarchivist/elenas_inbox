      PRESIDENT CLINTON RELEASES STATE-BY-STATE REPORT THAT
       UNDERSCORES IMPORTANCE OF A FEDERALLY-ENFORCEABLE
PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS FOR WOMEN AND RENEWS CALL ON CONGRESS TO
                      PASS LEGISLATION THIS YEAR
                              May 28,1998

       Today, the President is releasing a state-by-state report that documents why 122
million Americans cannot be assured access to all the patient protections recommended by the
President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality even if every state
enacted all of these protections into law_ This report also underscores the importance of the
patients' bill of rights for women. In releasing this report, the President renewed his call on
Congress to pass a Federally-enforceable patients' bill of rights before they adjourn this year.


Millions of Americans Do Not Have the Patient Protections Recommended by the Quality
Commission. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is frequently
used to preempt state-enacted protections. Because of ERISA, self-insured plans (plans
directly underwritten by employers) are not covered under state law and are not required to
abide by state-enacted protections. ERISA can even preempt important patient protections,
such as appeals rights, for health plans directly regulated by states. Forty-four states have
enacted at least one of the protections recommended by the President's Quality Commission.
However, a patchwork of non-comprehensive state laws cannot provide Americans with all
the protections they need because states do not have full authority over the 122 million
Americans who are in health plans governed by ERISA.

A Patients' Bill of Rights is Particularly Important to Women. Approximately 60 million
women are in ERISA health plans and cannot be assured that they would have access to the
full range of protections recommended by the Quality Commission without Federal
legislation. Women are particularly vulnerable without these protections because they are
greater users of health care services, they make three-quarters of the health care decisions for
their families, and they suffer from many chronic illnesses at a higher rate, such as arthritis
and osteoporosis.

       Over 60 percent of physician visits are made by women, and women make three
       quarters of the health care decisions in American households. Without adequate
       patient protections, women, and all Americans, will continue to be unable to effectively
       navigate through the nation's rapidly changing health care system.

       Women in managed care plans are increasingly dissatisfied with the quality of care.
       Nearly 70 percent of privately insured women ages 18 to 65 are in managed care plans.
        Almost two-fifths of women in managed care plans worry that they will not be able to
       get speciality care when they need it. Twenty-seven percent of women in managed
       care plans worry that they will be denied a medical procedure they need.
       services. The patient protection that gives women direct access to an
       obstetrician/gynecologist is not only necessary to make sure that pregnant women get
       the care they need, but is also important to assure women get important preventive
       services. Studies show that gynecologists are almost two times as likely to perform
       timely, needed women's preventive services.

The President Renews Call on the Congress to Pass A Patients' Bill of Rights.
The President called on Congress to enact the Quality Commission's recommendations to
assure high quality care for all patients. These recommendations include: assuring patients
access to easily understood information; access to the specialists, including specialists for
women's health needs; continuity of care for those undergoing a course of treatment for a
chronic or disabling condition; access to emergency services when and where the need arises;
disclosure of financial incentives that could influence medical decisions; prohibition of "gag
clauses"; anti-discrimination protections; and an internal and external appeals process to
address grievances with heillth decisions. The President is pleased that there is growing
bipartisan support to pass these long overdue protections.
