TEXT:
We'd agreed on a joint press release by Council, and Cliff Gabriel allowed
HHS to write a draft.  Their version boldly restates the bureaucratic
language and is much too dismissive of a single food agency.  Cliff is
rewriting and fighting this, I am headed into an ugly eqaul pay meeting.
We may well need you to weigh in with them.  I will fight with them this
afternoon. Cliff will email us with their response to fixing the
langauge.
