For Immediate Release                                            April 26, 1999


                          STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

       I am very pleased that the Supreme Court has agreed to take up the case regarding
the Food and Drug Administration's regulation of tobacco products. Almost three years
ago, the FDA put in place a regulation to protect our children from tobacco, which the
tobacco companies challenged in court. Every day, 3,000 young people become regular
smokers and 1,000 will have their lives cut short as a result. I remain firmly committed to
the FDA rule, which will help stop young people from smoking before they start by
eliminating advertising aimed at children and curbing minors' access to tobacco products.

                                            ###
