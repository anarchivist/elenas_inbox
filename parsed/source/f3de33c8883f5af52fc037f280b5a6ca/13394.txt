TEXT:
We just got a package of paper from the enviros on Murray.
The following groups have signed off on a letter written to
Senator Murray to "state our support for your recent proposed
legislation to repeal the clear cut rider. We applaud your effort
to restore the rule of law to our public forests."
The letter severly criticizes the Hatfield-Gorton language and
expressed conern about particular provisions of Murray, but
concludes that "We look forward to working w/you to address these
concerns and to enact this important legislation."
Sincerely,
SIERRA CLUB
NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL

There is also a good press release from Wilderness calling for
passage of Murray's bill (with a thank you to Furst for taking the
leadin the -fight to repeal the rider), and a press release
blasting Hatfield-Gorton.
I'll get the paper around to all of you asap by fax or messenger;
I'm headed over to work on the mark-up of the bill w/Chris Nolin.
