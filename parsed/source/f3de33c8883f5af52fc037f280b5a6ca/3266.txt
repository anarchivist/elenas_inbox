TEXT:
Bruce had asked Jerry and I to check in with him on Koop-Kessler today.
Before we make that call, we'd like to talk to you about where we are on
outreach and Congressional strategy and get your input. Also, can you
join us for call to Bruce? Can we catch you sometime between 4-5? I
should be at my desk.
