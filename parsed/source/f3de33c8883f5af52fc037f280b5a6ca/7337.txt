TEXT:
Bruce/Elena/Gene/Sally:

We just received the House bill and spoke with Peter.
Smith's bill includes strong reform language, but does not include a
training piece. Though Smith is not adverse to training, he is getting
beat up a lot by Rogan and Drier on the reforms, and doesn't want to
further alienate them by including a training piece that looks like the
creation of another federal training bureaucracy.  Smith told Watt and
Lofgren that if they can get some Republican support for training, he
would include it. With training included, Watt will get on the bill.
Lofgren is still a maybe.  Lofgren proposed putting money from the fee
into an existing program at Education (MESA) that provides math and
science programs for middle school kids whose parents did not go to
college. She expressed a preference for using any money generated to fund
an existing program.

Peter told Smith that though his reforms seem to reflect a lot of what we
would like, the bill would be unacceptable to us without training.  Smith
asked Peter very directly for our support.

Peter believes that we may be in a very good position. Our proposal could
be seen as a compromise between Abraham and Smith. Lofgren was arguing our
 reform language tonight.

Peter recommends that we prepare a letter for the mark-up on Thursday.
The letter would strongly support Smith's legislation insofar as it
comports with one of our key principles -- strong reforms to the HIB
 ,.

program coupled with a temporary increase in the cap. We would, however,
also want to indicate that the bill needs to include a training piece and
perhaps that his increase is high.    Peter further recommends that this
letter come from Bruce and Gene   (= White House).  Please advise.

Julie   &   Ceci
