      NGA Resolution # EC 1.2.3.            NGA Resolution Title:       State Innovative Education
                                            Reform Strategies.

      NGA is proposing to combine Goals 2000, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program
      (primarily focused on teacher training in math and science), and the Innovative Education
      Program (an existing block grant) into a single block grant to support state standards-based
      reform initiatives. In addition to allowing states to combine funds across these three relatively
      flexible programs, the primary effect of this proposal would be to allow states to use funds now
      earmarked for improving math and science teaching for a broader array of education reform
      purposes.

      Administration Position: The Administration is neutral on this proposal. DPC and the
      Education Department have been working on something quite similar and have no fundamental
      problem with the proposal. However, we do not recommend supporting this proposal at this
      time, for the following reasons: (1) The TIMSS results will be announced on the final day of the
      NGA meeting, highlighting the need for a substantial teacher training effort in math and science;
      (2) this initiative is a high priority for Gov. Voinavich but not a priority for the Democratic
      governors; (3) we can always introduce our own proposal along these lines when needed, as an
      alternative to less targeted and more damaging block grant proposals, or as the focus of a
      reauthorization of Goals 2000.


      NGA Resolution # EC 1.3.3.            NGA Resolution Title: State and Local Education
                                            Performance Partnerships.

      NGA proposes an expansion of the current Ed-Flex Demonstration Program. This program, part
      of Goals 2000, is currently limited to 12 states. It allows the Secretary of Education to delegate
      the authority to waive most statutory and regulatory requirement in federal K -12 education
      programs (except IDEA) to state education agencies, if they have an approved Goals 2000 state
      education reform plan, and if they are prepared to waive thier own state education requirements
      for local districts.

      Administration Position: The Administration supports this approach, and the President will
      announce his own version of this proposal to the governors.

      The administration proposal would drop the requirement for an approved Goals 2000 reform
      plan, and replace it with a strong requirement for accountability for results, including (1) high
      standards and testing; (2) public reporting of results including school report cards; and (3) state
      or local school district intervention in low-performing schools.
