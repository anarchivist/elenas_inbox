TEXT:
I need some help.  Sandy's off to Africa on a UNAIDS trip and we need some
help/advice on getting the President to do something meaningful on World
AIDS Day. Neither of us has been successful in reaching Bruce, though I
understand he's out of town today.  I'd really like 15 minutes to go
through some of this stuff with you all and try to get some closure.

Todd
