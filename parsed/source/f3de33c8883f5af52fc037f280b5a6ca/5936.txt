          Organization and Structure: The final report issued by the Commission on Immigration

          Reform (CIR) called for major changes in how the Federal Government sets and implements

          immigration policy. In particular, it urged a separation of the enforcement and benefit functions

          thta INS now performs.



          The Administration has studied these and other reform proposals, and has developed a plan to

          enhance immigration law enforcement while improving the delivery of immigration services and

          benefits. The Administration's plan is desigfl:ed to separate INS'recognizes the interrelated
