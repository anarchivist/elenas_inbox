TEXT:
We joined with OMB in some comments back to ED regarding how to
operationa1ize the three-year goal in Title VII (Bilingual) of ESEA.  We
got back ED's comments today -- rejecting OMB/DPC's comments in two key
areas-- and want to get your read on whether/how much to push back.

4th and 5th year Grant Continuation
In the draft bill, ED proposed that grants be rescinded i f "after three
years or four years of the grant, a significant number of students with
limited English proficiency in the project, who have been in the United
States for three consecutive years, have not made continuous progress in
learning English and in achieving challenging State content and
performance standards" ,.

OMB proposed language stating that the grants would be rescinded if "after
three years of the grant, a significant number of students in the program
with limited English proficiency, who have been in United States schools
for thre,e consecutive years, have not attained English proficiency per the
required annual assessment and made continuous progress in achieving
challenging State content and performance standards."     OMB believes that
the "continuous progress" standard in ED's proposed language is not a
sufficient measure of progress. We supported OMB's language -- given that
during the ESEA meetings, you pushed ED to strengthen its operationalizing
of the three-year goal.

Today, ED rejected OMB's proposed language and replied:
"Given that the new accountability procedures have not been implemented
(and will take time and work with the States and localities to do so),
given the complexities of when LEP students arrive in this country and
other important background variables (research and experience indicate
that the time and resources necessary to learn English vary dramatically
based on a variety of conditions and our proposal would authorize the
Secretary to establish benchmarks based on a range of such conditions),
and given the volatility of the issue politically, we prefer "continuous
progress", giving the Secretary flexibility to guide the process."

New Grants to Prior Grantees


OMB also proposed -- in order to take into account previous performance of
an applicant and prevent renewals or additional awards to previously
unsuccessful grantees -- that prior grantees show that substantial numbers
of students in the program with limited English proficiency, who had been
in the United States schools for three consecutive years, attained English
proficiency in accord with the required annual assessment and made
continuous progress in achieving challenging State content and performance
standards.

ED is opposed to this change, arguing that it is harsh and unnecessary (as
they believe that at the end of three or four years poor programs would
already be terminated, per the above section).  They also believe that it
might penalize grantees (and new students) for problems outside of their
control. OMB says that there aren't very many five year grants and sees
this as a check on renewals of poor-performing three-year grantees (or
five-year grantees who keep their grants despite poor performance) .
