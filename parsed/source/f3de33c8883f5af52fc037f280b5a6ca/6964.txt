I need to correct what I told you about the MN documents.  The MN trial
team has not had a chance to review the documents. At 5pm Monday, unless
Scalia says otherwise, the industry must turn over the documents to the MN
lawyers. MN has an experienced team standing by to review the documents
as quickly as possible. MN has the authority to make the documents public
without introducing them into evidence first, but may decide to hold
certain documents for use in the trial if doing so would benefit their cas
