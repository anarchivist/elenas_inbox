TEXT:
There will be a meeting on Friday, December 4, at 9:45 am in the First
Lady's Conference Room (Rm 100) to discuss Medal of Freedom candidates to
recommend to the President.  We've received a number of suggestions on


candidates, narrowed the list a little, and now need to discuss a
close-to-final list to give to the President from which he can make
choices.

The ceremony will likely be in January (maybe early February) but to do
things right, we should get a memo to the President prior to Christmas.

I'll circulate some paper late tomorrow so that you can look it over prior
to the meeting.  Let me or Carol Cleveland in my office know if you can
make it.

Thanks.
