TEXT:
Today, Paul Virtue, the INS General Counsel is testifying before Rep.
Lamar Smith's Subcommittee on Immigration.   I will let you know if
anything noteworthy comes up.

 Generally, Smith plans to hold a hearing weekly on immigration issues.
Next week, 3/11 Smith will hold a hearing on "Immigrant Quality".    Smith
is expected to argue that current immigrants are low-skilled and are
adversely impacting minority communities in the US.  This is an attempt by
Smith to argue for changing our legal immigration system to admit
immigrants with higher levels of education.

3/18 - Immigrant Smuggling and Overstays - INS will testify.

please let me know if you have any questions.
