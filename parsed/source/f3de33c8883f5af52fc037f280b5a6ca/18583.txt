Subject:         Farm Summit

Sec Glickman went to North Caroline to meet with the Gov and state
delegation on tobacco. Glickman should do the same think with the
Kentucky gov and congressional delegation.  Karen Armstrong Cummins who
originially requested the meeting and summit should be a part of this
meeting. Would you and Bruce agree with this?
