TEXT:
That looks pretty good -- but we need to think through the TANF/Labor regs
section to make sure it highlights the right issues. The news of the TANF
reg is all around meeting the work rates -- penalties, case load credit,
etc.  I don't think I would bring up side issues like domestic violence.
~aybe you can sell these as two new regs designed to promote work (and
responsibility) .
