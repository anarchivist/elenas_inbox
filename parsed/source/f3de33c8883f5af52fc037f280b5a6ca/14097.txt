TEXT:
Today's Monitor says that the conferees will meet at 9:30
tomorrow.
Elena -- You will recall that the liability issue was the key
roadblock to the conference.   I take the scheduling of the meeting
as a signal that a deal is in the works (or has already been
made).   Jim Brown and I will report to you on whatever
intelligence we pick up.
