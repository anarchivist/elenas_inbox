Subject: Update on CBC and AIDS

I got a message this morning from Mary Beth Donohue, COS at HHS.  I
believe that either she or Kevin has spoken with Maria and Minyon but I
wanted to relate what she told me to make sure we're on the same page.

HHS will be meeting with CBC members' staff within the next week to get a
response to their proposals for FY98 and FY99. Rep. Stokes has been
meeting with community organizations and staff over the past few weeks,
and is expected to provide some response to the HHS proposal as well as
some additional ideas.

Sec. Shalala and SG Satcher are expected to meet on or about 9/11 with
Reps. Stokes, Waters, and Green (Congressional Hispanic Caucus) to discuss
the proposal more formally.

I shared with Mary Beth last week some concern that what HHS has been
hearing from CBC staff ("you're on the right road") and what staff and
Members are saying ("what we're seeing isn't sufficient") are not in
sync.  They're aware of some of that.  I said that the longer this goes on
unresolved the more opportunity there is to criticize the Administration,
even if delays in resolution are out of our hands.

Let me know if you have any questions.
