                     TOBACCO GUIDELINES FOR FOREIGN POSTS
                                    2/12/98


Q.   What do the guidelines accomplish?

A.   The guidelines provide explicit guidance to all U.S. Government representatives to do
     nothing that will promote, or could be construed as promoting, the overseas sale or
     export of tobacco or tobacco products. They also significantly restrict U.S. diplomatic
     and commercial officials' latitude to challenge local country laws or regulations that are
     based on sound public health principles and applied equally to both foreign and domestic
     products.


Q.   Who are the guidelines sent to?

A.   The guidelines are being sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts, including embassies and
     commercial offices. They will also be circulated among Washington agencies involved in
     international health, trade and commerce.


Q.   What is new in the guidelines?

A.   While reflecting long-standing Clinton Administration practice, the guidelines explicitly
     enunciate a single policy among agencies that deal with international health, trade and
     commercial issues. These guidelines provide uniform instruction to overseas
     representatives of the Departments of State, Commerce and Agriculture with regard to
     trade and investment promotion. Heretofore, tobacco and tobacco products were
     considered no different than any other legally traded goods; this guidance makes clear
     that, because of the health implications, tobacco is indeed different, and actively
     encourages U.S. posts to assist and promote tobacco-control efforts. The guidelines are
     consistent with recent legislation, known as the Doggett Amendment, which sought to
     limit promotion by the government of tobacco overseas.


Q.   What other steps that should be taken?

A.   When the President announced his plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation, he called
     for a strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco. These policy guidelines
     should be incorporated into comprehensive tobacco legislation. In addition,
     Government -- working bilaterally, multilaterally, and through NGOs -- can actively
     support international tobacco-control initiatives.

Q.   Are there exampJes of what this would prohibit?

A.   Under the guidelines, a number of activities by U.S. officials are prohibited. U.S.
     Ambassadors cannot tout the opening of new cigarette factories overseas and U.S.
     government representatives cannot attend public or privately-sponsored events that serve
     to promote the sale or distribution of tobacco or tobacco products. In addition, U.S.
     officials are prohibited from seeking to delay enactment or counter the effects of local laws
     or regulations that inhibit the sale of tobacco or tobacco products -- so long as they are
     applied equally to all such products, foreign and domestic.
