Feinstein Education Ballot Initiative. Sen. Feinstein sent you a copy of the "Excellence and
Accountability in Education Act of 1998", a California ballot initiative she has proposed. The
initiative contains many elements that reflect your own agenda: requiring grade-by-grade
education standards; ending social promotions and providing mandatory summer school for
students who do not meet standards; expanding California's existing class size reduction
program; lengthening the school year; improving teacher quality through such steps as providing
incentives to recruit well trained new teachers, raising teacher certification requirements and
rewarding outstanding teachers; and lowering voter approval of school construction bonds from
2/3 to a simple majority. The initiative would fund these activities through a $1 per pack
tobacco tax. Despite the attractiveness of the education proposals, we believe that the funding
proposal contained in the initiative would make it very difficult for you to support.

Education Opportunity Zones. DPC staff has met with a coalition of education and advocacy
groups concerned about urban education (e.g., US Conference of Mayors, Council of Great City
Schools, Urban League, MALDEF, AFT and NEA) to review the details of your Education
Opportunity Zones proposal. While some raised concerns with the requirement that school
districts end social promotions, overall the groups are very supportive and are all likely to
strongly support the initiative. Mike Cohen and Secretary Riley met with Bill Clay earlier this
week to share the details of your proposal and seek his support. A stafflevel follow-up meeting
is scheduled for next week. As with the advocacy groups, we expect some resistance to the
requirement to end social promotions, but otherwise anticipate his support. We expect that the
legislation will be ready for transmittal to Congress within the next several weeks, and we are
working on developing a suitable transmittal event.

Class Size Reduction Initiative. DPC and Education Department staff are consulting with
education, advocacy and other organizations on the final design of the class size reduction
initiative. We are paying particular attention to Democratic governors, such as Carper, Miller
and Chiles, who either have expressed interest in class size reduction, or concerns about our use
of the tobacco funds. We expect to have legislation drafted on this initiative within the next
several weeks.
