TEXT:
You asked about thoughts for the NYT interview and questions about the
past 5 years and the future:

*       In response to the "are you stalled?" question:  I think he
should point out the list of what happened in one week last month: health
care bill of rights, adoption, pushing welfare to work, and FDA reform.
In the last month he's done education standards, safety locks on guns,
moves to crack down on hate crimes, and food safety among others.


* Past Record. Specifics are better than generalities because they are
more credible. Hence, on questions about the first 5 years I would
include the specific achievements along with the credo:

" In the last five years this country has enjoyed great economic success,
moved millions of people off welfare, cut its crime rate, and moved very
close to balancing our budget. We've done that by giving people the
opportunity to achieve_in part through programs like education and EITC,
requiring responsibility from them for their actions through tough crime
and child support measures for individuals and requiring companies to
protect the environment. And in addition, the country has reaffirmed its
sense that weare all in this together-- and the country's determination
to protect medicare and medicaid demonstrated that."


*   People don't give much credit for the past, in most answers he might
work in future oriented goals that show why the President deserves
continued support: my choices are protecting kids with better child
care, tobacco control, expanding FMLA, and improved elementary school
education (standards), providing health care choice and elder care.
improvements, including protection of medicare and medicaid, and keeping
our momentum on fighting drugs and crime.


Regards, Tom
