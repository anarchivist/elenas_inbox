TEXT:
Andrew, here is the paragraph you asked for on the working group with the
couple of extra sentences as requested.


Working Group on Highlighting Issues in Farm Policy: The DPC has
establishea a working group to research and promote high-profile issues of
interest to farmers.  Tom Freedman of DPC is coordinating the working
group, which will eventually include representatives from USDA, NEC, CEA,
Treasury and OPL.
The first meeting of the group focused on significant rural issues that
are suitable for Presidential announcement. Among the topics for further
investigation are the concept of whole farm insurance (insurance that
covers not just a crop but an entire farm's revenue) and IRA-style
accounts for family farmers to guard against losses.
