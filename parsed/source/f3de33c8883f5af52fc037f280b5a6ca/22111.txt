TEXT:
We've talked to OMB and here's what we think we can fund re: legal
immigrants.  I think both are good policies that build on our successes in
the Balanced Budget Act and Ag Research bill.  Both proposals are
structured to have costs almost entirely in the out years.

Disability and Health Benefits
Because of the Balanced Budget Act, legal immigrants who were receiving
SSI before August 22, 1996 or were in the country before August 22, 1996
but subsequently became disabled are eligible for SSI.

Still, most low income legal immigrants who enter the country after August
22, 1996 are barred from SSI even if they experience an unforeseen
accident or disabling illness.  The proposal would address this concern by
restoring eligibility for SSI and Medicaid in FY 2001 to legal immigrants
who have become disabled after entering the United States and have been in
this country for five years. Thus, legal immigrants would be subject to a
five year ban on receiving SSI and related Medicaid benefits (as they are
for TANF and regular Medicaid), but would be eligible after their first
five years in the U.S.   This proposal is estimated to assist 40,000 legal
immigrants by 2004, about half of whom are elderly.

Food Stamps

The Ag Research bill restored Food Stamps to legal immigrant children,
senior citizens, and the disabled in the U.S. as of August 22, 1996.
However, while the disabled provisions covered people in the U.S. by 1996
who subsequently become disabled, the elderly provision only covered those
who were already 65 as of August 22, 1996. This proposal extends Food
Stamp eligibility to include legal immigrants in the United States on
August 22, 1996 and once they become elderly.
