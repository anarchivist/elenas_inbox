TEXT:
The Department of Labor has heard that Robert Pear is poking around the
issue of employment of people with disabilities.    They sent him our recent
executive order on the subject.   The only intelligence we have on his
angle is that it may have been precipitated by Sen. Kennedy's office.    He
is preparing to introduce a still-evolving bill with Jeffords to offer
continued Medicare/Medicaid to people leaving the SSI/SSDI rolls for
work. We are trying to work out our position on it; it will cost money.
