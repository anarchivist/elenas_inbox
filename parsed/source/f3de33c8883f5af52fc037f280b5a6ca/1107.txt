TEXT:
According to Bill White of public liaison, there is a meeting of something
called the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights with Erskine on Thursday
or Friday, that will include 2 disability rights activists.   (Justin Dart
and Pat Wright; the latter is very helpful; the former is suing over the
disability naturalization regulation.)  Bill says he needs to prepare a
policy update/1 pager on disability issues and talking points. Any
glimmers of this on your end?

(FYI:  I think this civil rights group met with Erskine once before,
without our involvement. At the meeting, Pat Wright handed Rahm a memo on
the disability regulation and the oath.  I got a copy of the memo from the
advocate.  I never heard a peep from Rahm, even though the advocates came
away saying that Rahm was going to "take care of it.")
