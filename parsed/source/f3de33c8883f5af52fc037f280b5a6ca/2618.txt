Subject:         Re: Welfare-to-Work

I talked to Archer and told him where we were, how hard we were trying to
make good on the Pres's commitment, how we were trying to structure this
like empowerment zones, etc.  I think. he'll be OK. He would prefer a
60-40 split like CDBG rather than 50-50 -- but as I tried to explain to
him, in CDBG the states don't have to spend any of their 40 in cities,
whereas in our proposal the states have to spend all of their $ in areas
with unemployment and poverty rates 20% above the state average -- which
is going to mean a good chunk goes to cities.

I think I'll have Andrew talk to him too (and Rendell, who's making them
all nervous) -- and I'll call him again soon. Archer did say he would be
happy to unleash the mayors on Capitol Hill, which I told him would be a
very good idea.  In any case, he said he was working hard on 1998 and
laying the groundwork for the VP in 2000, so I think you're doing fine.
