TEXT:
The House Appropriations Committee expects to mark up the supplemental
bill tomorrow (Thursday, 3/11) at 1:00pm.  Therefore, we need to release
the letter tomorrow morning.  Need WW decision on level of veto threat:


"Were the bill to be presented to the President with the offsets discussed
above, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State would
reconunend that he veto the bill." Please provide conunents/clearance by
lOam tomorrow.   Thank you.

The Honorable C.W. Bill Young
Chairman
Conunittee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C.  20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

         The purpose of this letter is to provide the AdministrationD,s
views on the bill making emergency supplemental appropriations 'to assist
in Central AmericaD,s recovery from recent natural disasters, to provide
urgent funding related to the situation in Jordan, and to provide vital
loans and other assistance to our farmers and ranchers.   The
Administration appreciates the ConunitteeD,s prompt action on the
PresidentD,s supplemental requests and looks forward to working with the
Conunittee on a bi-partisan basis on this important legislation.  However,
we have significant concerns with the approach being taken in the
Conunittee amendment. As the Conunittee develops its version of the bill,
we ask that you consider the AdministrationD,s views.

         providing essential assistance to victims of natural disasters and
assisting our farmers at home with vital financing clearly fall in the
category of needs that are urgent, unanticipated, and essential     that
is, emergency requirements. Therefore, they clearly deserve to be funded
qUickly, fully, and without requiring offsets that could force
unacceptable reductions in important programs.   We support the
ConunitteeD,s action of providing defense-related emergency funding in
response to Hurricane Mitch without offsets and believe that consistent
treatment should be applied to non-defense related emergency
requirements.

        It is our understanding that the Committee may propose rescinding
nearly $1 billion from international affairs accounts, with the largest
portion being a rescission of $748 million in appropriations of callable
capital from early U.S. payments to the Asian Development Bank (ASDB), the
World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank.   Such rescissions
would be extremely ill-advised.   Rescinding the callable capital funding
would send the wrong signal to financial markets and could require the
ASDB and other multilateral development banks (MDBs) to pay a premium on
their borrowing, which would lead to the restriction of capital flows
necessary to strengthen the global economy and expand U.S. exports.   At a
time when some Asian and other developing economies are beginning to
recover, this step would be highly unproductive.

        In addition, this rescission of callable capital would make
additional appropriations of callable capital to the MDBs vulnerable to
future rescissions as well and thereby call into question U.S. commitment
to all multilateral development banks.   This could have a detrimental
effect on capital flows and economic growth globally, including in Asia,
Africa, and Latin America. This unintended consequence would even more
broadly delay economic recovery in markets vital to the United States.

        The other possible rescissions in the international affairs area
would undermine a host of important objectives in many programs.  For
example, the rescissions would cut support for U.S. exports, undermining


our efforts to penetrate foreign markets and provide jobs for American
workers.   At a time when the United States needs to promote its exports,
this is a particular misguided step. The rescissions would also undercut
free market reform and democracy promotion in the New Independent States
and in Eastern Europe, areas where it is manifestly in AmericaO,s
interests to encourage reform. The rescission of development assistance
would set back efforts in the poorest countries, including possibly in
those hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.

        Other rescissions would undermine our efforts to provide
peacekeeping operations in troubled areas of the world.   The rescission
of Global Environment Facility funding would be highly detrimental to the
cause of improving global environmental protection.  Still other cuts
would reduce our contributions to international organizations, where
AmericaO,s reputation as a contributor in good standing is already
tarnished.  Rescissions also would be made against critical efforts to
halt proliferation and to counter terrorism, areas where America cannot
afford to be pulling back.

       Taken together, these
