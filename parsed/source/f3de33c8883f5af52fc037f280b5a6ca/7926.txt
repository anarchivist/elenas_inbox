                       Q'S AND A'S REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S
                        "UNZ INITIATIVE" (PROPOSITION 227)

 Q:   What is the Administration's reaction to the passage of Proposition 227 in
      California?

A.    The most important message coming from voters in California is that we have to make
      sure that students, particularly those who are immigrants or children of immigrants, .
      learn English as quickly as possible. The President agrees with that message, though he
      disagrees with the particular approach in Proposition 227.

      President Clinton and Secretary Riley opposed the Unz Initiative in California because it
      is the wrong way to accomplish this goal. They believe that the Unz Initiative will result
      in fewer Limited English Proficient students learning English, lower academic
      achievement in other subjects, and greater frustration for students and parents. Its
      one-year time limit and one-size-fits all approach will harm kids rather than help them,
      and will limit the ability of local communities and schools to tailor approaches that meet
      the needs oftheir children.

      Instead the President supports local programs that set a goal of helping students learn
      English within 3 years, are held accountable for meeting that goal, are given the
      flexibility to enable educators and parents to fashion programs that work best for their
      students, and make sure that the teachers have the knowledge and skills to get the job
      done, Next year, when Congress reauthorizes all elementary and secondary education
      programs, he will propose legislation to translate these principals into law. And the
      President will continue to press the Congress to support his request to double funding for
      training teachers in English-as-a-second language and bilingual education programs.

 Q.   How do you explain that the majority(or a large percentage) of Latinos in California
      voted for Prop 227 in spite ofthe President's opposition?

 A.   We recognize that many Latino parents were dissatisfied with the educational
      opportunities available to their children. Many felt that it was taking too long for their
      children to master English. That is why we have called for strengthening bilingual
      programs by increasing funding for bilingual teachers and by establishing a three year
      goal for all children to move into all English classes. We believe this approach is
      preferable to Proposition 227.

 Q.   Will the President support legislation currently in Congress (the Riggs bill) to
      overhaul the federal bilingual education program?

 A.   The President believes that efforts to strengthen the federal bilingual education program
      should be based on the principles he and Secretary Riley have already articulated: (1) a


                                                1
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
         goal for students to learn English within 3 years; (2) accountability for results; (3) local
         flexibility for determining how best to achieve results; and (4) investments in providing
         qualified teachers. The President plans to send legislation to Congress fully consistent
         with these principles next year, when Congress takes up all federal elementary and
         secondary education programs. The Riggs bill now before the House Education and
         Workforce Committee is not consistent with these principles, and so the Administration
         is opposed to that bill.

    Q:   Will you join those who are planning to bring legal action to stop the
         implementation of Proposition 227?

    A.   We are not at this time joining in legal challenges to Proposition 227. The Departments of
         Justice and Education will carefully monitor the educational programs that are put in
         place under the proposition to ensure that they comply with the civil rights laws. Whether
         they do so will depend upon how they are implemented and whether children with limited
         English proficiency are provided a realistic opportunity to succeed academically.

    Q:   What steps will you take with regard to school districts who are now subject to
         compliance agreements with the Department of Education that may be inconsistent
         with Prop. 227?

    A:   The Department has entered into approximately 55 compliance agreements with school
         districts in California in order to ensure that they provide adequate educational
         opportunities for children who have limited proficiency in English. These agreements,
         which were entered into voluntarily by the school districts, provide for a variety of
         educational approaches. Many provide for bilingual education, some do not. The
         Department is prepared to consider requests by these school districts for changes to these
         agreements and to provide technical assistance to all districts regarding what policies are
         permissible under federal law.

    Q:   What will be the effect of Proposition 227 on applications for federal grants to
         support bilingual education programs?

    A.   Many districts in California receive competitive grants under the Department of
         Education's Bilingual Education Program. That prograrn supports, not only bilingual
         education projects, but also other instructional approaches for limited English proficient
         children. Districts that must revise their instructional approaches to comply with
         Proposition 227 may also need approval from the Department of Education to alter their
         plans for spending federal funds. The Department of Education is prepared to review any
         such proposed revisions, as well as revisions to pending grants proposals, to determine,
         on a case-by-case basis, whether they can be approved consistent with current program
         requirements.
