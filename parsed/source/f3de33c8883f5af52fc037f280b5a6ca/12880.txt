TEXT:
Leanne and I attended this morning's meeting with WH and DOJ staff to
discuss the President's participation in next week's conference.

It seems that we have all agreed now on a time, and basic format.  The
President will be there from approximately 12:45pm - 2:00pm. He will be
introduced by the AG, and deliver remarks from a podium. He will then
participate in a roundtable discussion for approximately one hour.

I have left you both copies of the roundtable participants list that
Justice provided today.  Right now the list includes 30 people.   (I have
starred for you a few people that there may be specific issues around.)
The proposal is to have the President act at the "moderator", posing the
questions, and Charles Ogletree and Christopher Stone would act as the
facilitators, moving the discussion along and keeping time.  We will need
to work pretty specifically with DOJ on a script/suggested questions for
the roundtable.

Scheduling is somewhat concerned about the fact that there are so many
people on the roundtable.  From past experience, they know the President
generally likes to let everyone speak, and this would likely not be
possible in the one hour he will be there.

Let me know if you have questions, or would like to discuss.
