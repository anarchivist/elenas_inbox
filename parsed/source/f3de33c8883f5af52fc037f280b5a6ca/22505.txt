TEXT:
Elena -- Ellen has not been in the office much at all the past 4 days, she
was in New Orleans over Tuesday and part of Wednesday.  If she has not
been able to call you back, and I don't think she has, I apologize.  Is
there anything I can pass on to her, or should I just reiterate that she
should call you?

Thanks,

Ginger
