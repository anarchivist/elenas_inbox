     Dear Mr. Chainnan, [Dear Senator Moynihan]

     We write to express our strong opposition to proposals for education tax incentives (Joint
     Committee on Taxation, "Description of Chainnan's Mark of Proposals Relating to Education
     Incentives" (JCX-020-99), May 17, 1999), which we understand your Committee will consider
     this week. In the summer of 1997, as Congress was in the final stages of consideration of the
     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the President stated that he would veto the legislation ifit
     contained a proposal relating to Education Savings Accounts that is similar to the education
     savings account proposals contained in the Chainnan's Mark. In 1998, we wrote to infonn you
     that we would recommend to the President that he veto similar legislation, which, after
     consideration and approval by Congress, he did. If these proposals were to pass the Congress
     this year, we again would recommend to the President that he veto the bill.

     Every American child deserves a high quality elementary and secondary education. We believe
     that targeting our limited Federal resources to build stronger public schools will help ensure all
     our children receive the education they need to be productive citizens. Public schools serve
     approximately 90 percent of students in grades K -12 and currently face record-breaking
     enrollments. By focusing resources on public schools, we can leverage community investment
     to help parents, teachers, and administrators meet the important educational challenges they face
     in serving the vast majority of our children: meeting high standards for learning and discipline;
     fixing school buildings; and providing a safe, drug-free 'environment for children. For this
     reason, the President's FY 2000 budget proposals includes a school modernization bond initiative
     that would leverage $25 billion of new public school construction. In contrast, the Chainnan's
     Mark diverts needed attention and resources from our public schools.

     The current bill disproportionately benefits the most affluent families and provides little benefit
     to lower-and middle-income families. Additionally, given the expansion of tax-preferred
     savings vehicles in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we do not believe that further increasing the
     contribution limits for Education IRAs will generate much additional savings. Instead, the
     Chainnan's Mark would reward families, particularly those with significant means, for what they
     would do absent any increase.

     We are also concerned that the bill would create significant compliance problems. The
     legislation allows tax-free withdrawals from Education IRAs for, among other things, tuition,
     fees, academic tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies and equipment expenses incurred
     in connection with the child's enrollment or attendance at a public or private school.
     Withdrawals are also tax-free if used for room and board, unifonns, transportation or
     supplementary items or services required or provided by the school. Distinguishing between an
     appropriately tax-free withdrawal and one that should be subject to tax would lead to significant
     additional record keeping burdens for families and schools, as well as disputes when
     discretionary purchases are made.

     We, therefore, urge the Committee not to approve this legislation.
                                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
     We understand that Senator [Robb] intends to offer a substitute that would replace the education
     IRA proposals in this bill with school modernization/construction bond proposals similar to those
     in the President's budget for FY 2000. We strongly prefer that proposal and other alternatives
     that devote Federal revenue to improving the public schools so that a high-quality education is
     available to every American child regardless oftheir family income. Therefore, we strongly
     support Senator [Robb]'s substitute.

     Sincerely,



     Robert E. Rubin                      Richard W. Riley
     Secretary of the Treasury            Secretary of Education
