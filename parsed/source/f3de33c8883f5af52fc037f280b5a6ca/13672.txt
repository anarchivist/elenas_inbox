FUTURE OF KEY ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS UNCERTAIN IN WAKE OF DOLE RESIGNATION
Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott (R-Miss), one of the possible successors
to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan), has pledged to continue
Republican attempts to reform superfund, a Senate committee aide told BNA May
15.
A spokeswoman for Dole declined May 15 to speculate on the prospects for
floor consideration of the senator's property rights bill (S 605) in light of
his resignation. That bill would require compensation of landowners whose
property values were diminished by one-third or more as a result of federal
regulations.                                                ~
Late in the week of May 5, the spokeswoman had said that Dofe hoped to


schedule the bill for floor consideration before the Memorial Day
congressional recess. Lott has indicated to Sen. Robert Smith's (R-NH) staff
that superfund reform (S 1285) will continue to be "a top environmental
priority for this session"     in the Senate, Anna Matz, deputy press secretary
for Smith, told BNA May 15. "We have every reason to believe"      that Lott will
maintain the same level of commitment toward superfund that Dole had, Matz
said.
Lott was one of the original co-sponsors of S 1285, a Senate majority aide
said. He added that it was hard to speculate what would happen to the reform
bill in light of Dole's resignation as majority leader. Staff from Lott's
office were unavailable for comment May 15.
Dole A Catalyst For Superfund Bill
Although he was not directly involved in the legislation, Dole was a key
figure in the superfund debate in the Senate "because he's the one who set
aside floor space to keep superfund on the agenda, " Julie Rochman, assistant
vice president for public affairs with the Alliance of American Insurers, told
BNA May 15.
According to Rochman, Dole told Smith he was committed to moving a
superfund reform bill, and had promised Smith that once S 1285 cleared the
full committee, " i t would be on the short list of things to do."
Smith's bill, which was recently amended to change certain liability
exemptions for site cleanups and other provisions in the bill, did not have
Dole's initial support because of a tax credit mechanism in the original
language. Dole's opposition to the language led to the cancellation of
hearings on the bill in the fall of 1995.
An industry source told BNA May 15 that Dole's relinquishing of power could
have either a positive or negative effect on the Smith bill. "Either you have
no fire power to get it done," because Dole is absent from the process, or
" i t ' s possible that people will actually get something done because the
political posturing" associated with the superfund debate will leave with
Dole, she said.
Any hesitation from the successor will hurt the reform process, Rochman
said. "It's important that time not be lost" on moving the bill.
An Environmental Protection Agency official told BNA May 15 that it was too
soon to speculate how Dole's shuffling of duties would affect the reform
process, but agreed that time was running out. EPA " i s still committed to
getting a bill out this year, " the official said.
Some Say Takings Bill May Be Unaffected
Aides to Dole have given no indication to the property rights community
that the Senate Republican Leader has backed down from his commitment to bring
up S 605 for floor consideration, Nancie Marzulla, president of Defenders of
property Rights, told BNA May 15.
She said her organization consistently had been in close contact with his
staff regarding prospects for the bill. -'I don't know that Dole's resigning
to run for president is going to hurt us, " she said.
She said the fact that Dole's two successors in the Republican leadership
-- Lott and Nickles -- are proponents of property rights bodes well for
consideration of the bill. Nickles, who is chairman of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee, authored one of the titles in the Dole bill, she noted.
Marzulla said discussions have been under way regarding the possibility of
narrowing the scope of the bill to'address only certain issues, such as real
property.
She said bill proponents have indicated that they would support a narrowing
of the bill's scope only if they have a commitment from opponents that they
would support the bill if certain changes were made.
Meanwhile, John Echeverria, general counsel to the National Audubon
Society, agreed May 15 that prospects for consideration of the takings bill
could be unaffected by Dole's resignation, since Lott, his likely successor,
"generally is viewed as a more right-wing Republican. ' ,
Echeverria told BNA, --I think it is hard to predict, and I don't think


 [Dole's resignation] is going to make a lot of difference."
He said there has been much speculation that other proponents of the bill
will seek to narrow the scope of the legislation before bringing it to the
Senate floor.
Glenn Sugameli, counsel to the National Wildlife Federation, told BNA May
15 that Dole's resignation would provide --reason and cover"   for bill
proponents to back down from commitments to bring the measure to the Senate
floor.
He said more significant than the Dole resignation was what he viewed as
the retreat of House Republicans from the whole compensation issue.
Sugameli said he based his assessment on a statement of principles issued
by the House Republican Task Force May 15 that said that --private property
owners should be assured greater certainty regarding the use of their
property. They should also be assured due process to challenge any adverse
decisions and when their property rights are in question."   (See related
report in this issue.)
He said the absence of language calling for compensation of landowners
whose property values have been diminished as a result of federal regulation,
as well as recent published comments, indicate that --even [House Speaker
Newt] Gingrich has gotten the message. ' ,
