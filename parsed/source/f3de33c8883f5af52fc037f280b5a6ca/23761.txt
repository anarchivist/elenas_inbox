TEXT:
Crime -- Federal Gun Prosecutions:  In their response to our gun
legislation, the NRA and certain Republicans have countered that greater
enforcement of existing firearms laws are needed instead of new laws --
pointing to a decreased number of federal firearms prosecutions under this
Administration. While it is accurate that more lower level gun cases were
prosecuted under the Bush AdministrationD,s D&Operation Triggerlock,D8 the
number of federal prosecutions of more serious gun offenders (persons
serving sentences of over 5 years) during this Administration is up by
nearly 30 percent (from 1049 to 1345). In addition, better federal
coordination with state and local law enforcement has contributed to a 25
percent increase in criminals sent to prison for state and federal weapons
offenses since 1992 (from 20,681 to 25,186).   Nonetheless, our last two
budget requests have called for additional resources to bolster our
federal gun enforcement efforts, including funds to add over 280 new ATF
agents and more than 40 new federal prosecutors to help investigate,
arrest, and prosecute more gun criminals in the federal system.
