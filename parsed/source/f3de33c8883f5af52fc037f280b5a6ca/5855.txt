      It's too bad they broke some of the stuff, but the story looks OK and they
      still don't have the big news on the block grant.  You might want to talk
      with Ellen Galinsky to get her to say more helpful things.

      Check out my quote near the end of the story, where the reporter actually
      has me saying, "It's 1998."    I think I said, "In 1998 ... "


                                  Clinton Plans Child Care Package

                               By Sandra Sobieraj

                               Tuesday, January 6, 1998; 7:53 p.m. EST

                               WASHINGTON (AP)     -- President Clinton has
      assembled a
                                  $20 billion package of tax credits and other
      programs to make
                                  child care more accessible and affordable,
      congressional and
                               White House sources said Tuesday.

                                  The proposals include a permanent 25 percent tax
      credit for
                               businesses that establish and run child care
      facilities for
                               workers, or reserve slots in exisiting centers,
      the sources said,
                                  speaking on condition of anonymity.

                                  The package, to be unveiled Wednesday, also
      includes what
                                  one source called --dramatic expansions"     of both
      the income
                                  tax credit that parents can take for child care
      expenses and
                                  federal contributions to state child care
      subsidies for
                                  low-income parents and welfare recipients
      entering jobs.

                                  Two White House officials discussing the package


 on condition
                             of anonymity would not say how much Clinton would
 ask
                             Congress to increase this so-called "child care
 development
                             block grant"     program. overall, the package-of
 tax credits and
                             subsidies would cost $20 billion over five years,
 they said.

                             White House domestic policy chief Bruce Reed
 called the
                             package    a sweeping plan to help parents balance
 the
                             demands of work and family by making child care
 more
                             accessible, more affordable and safer. ' ,

                             Clinton's plan would limit the dependent-care tax
 credit to a
                             family's total tax liability. Only the
 earned-income tax credit
                             aimed at working poor families is now refundable,
 providing
                             them a check from the government if the credit
 exceeds their
                             tax liability.

                             Advocates have pushed to also make the child-care
 credit
                             refundable so that poor parents who pay no taxes
 would get
                             new government subsidies for their child care
 expenses.
                             Republicans have opposed expanding the welfare
 aspects of
                             federal tax breaks.

                             "If (the administration) really wanted to be
 helpful, efforts need
                             to be made to get it refundable, otherwise people
 from
                             low-income jobs and households have much less
 access   I   I   I   said
                             Ellen Galinsky, president of the New York-based
 Families and
                             Work Institute. The institute has consulted
 extensively with first
                             lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has made child ca
 re a pet
                             project.

                             Clinton, accompanied by Vice President Al Gore
 and Mrs.
                             Clinton, was to detail the package in a splashy
 East Room
                             ceremony Wednesday afternoon. He hoped to set a
 bipartisan
                             tone, inviting several Republican governors and
 members of


                        Congress to share in the announcement.

                        The Senate last year passed a bill by Sen.
 Herbert H. Kohl,
                        D-Wis., that, for a short term, would have
 allowed businesses
                        to reduce their federal tax liability by $1 for
 every $2 they
                        spend on child care for their employees.

                        Although the House never voted on it, supporters
 said the
                        Senate action bodes well for the smaller but
 permanent 25
                        percent tax credit that Clinton will advocate.

                        The White House was also counting on a boost from
 this year's
                        election climate, where help for middle-class
 families would
                        prove popular with many voters.

                        " I think there is broad bipartisan support in
 Congress and in
                        statehouses around the country for doing more on
 child care, ' ,
                        Reed said. " I t ' s 1998. I think it is clear there
 will be real
                        interest in the president's plan."

                        Other pieces of the package were announced at the
 Clintons'
                        White House conference on child care in October.
 They
                        include:

                        --Establishing a scholarship fund to provide $250
 million over
                        five years for additional training of up to
 50,000 child care
                        providers. The workers, who would get $1,500
 each, would
                        have to remain in the field at least a year.
 They'd be guaranteed
                        a raise when they finished.

                        --Eliminating state barriers to checking criminal
 backgrounds of
                        child care workers. That plan must be approved by
 Congress
                        and all 50 states.

                        --Legislation enforcing state health and safety
 standards in
                        federal child care centers.

                        However, the plan would not establish any
 national child care
                        standards, officials said. They noted that
 Clinton has opposed


                      such national standards for child care since his
 days as
                      chairman of the National Governors Association.
