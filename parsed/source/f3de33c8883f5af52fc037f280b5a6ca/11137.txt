Chris may have already let you know about this, but just in case:

HHS Office of Inspector General press conference on Medicare fraud.     On
Tuesday, the independent, OIG held a press conference to announce its
annual report on improper Medicare payments.  (we just learned of it
today).  It found:

Error rate down by 35 percent from last year, 50 percent from 1996.   In
FY 1997, the OIG estimated that Medicare made $20 billion on improper
payments; in 1998, this amount was reduced to $12.6 billion. This
improvement was attributed to improved program oversight and enforcement
and greater provider compliance.

"Examples of improper payments include a community mental health center
that was paid $21,421 for services later determined by medical reviewers
to be medically unnecessary.  In another case, a skilled nursing facility
billed Medicare $10,428 for a 51-day skilled-nursing stay by an elderly
patient. Because medical records showed that the patient received only
maintenance-level, nonskilled care, the payment was denied. In a third
case, a physician billed Medicare $871 for 40 hospital visits. The medical
records, however, supported only 18 visits. In each of these instances,
and in all other cases where improper payments were sp~cifically
identified, action was taken to deny the claim and to recover the
overpayment."
