 TEXT:
 Domestic Violence. As you probably know, a federal judge in Roanoke, VA ruled
 unconstitutional a federal provision contained in the Violence
 Against Women's Act that gave physically abused women the right
 to sue their attackers for damages.  The Solicitor General's
 office is deciding whether or not to appeal the decision. This is made more
 difficult because the appellant is not sure she
 wants to appeal.  The Violence Against Women's Office has not
 issued a formal statement on the court ruling, but is taking
 press calls. Though they are disappointed with the ruling,


    the ruling does not go to the heart of the Violence Against Women
    Act.
    Child Support Enforcement. The Federal Court of Appeals affirmed
    the constitutionality of the Child Support Recovery Act.   The
    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Connecticut affirmed
    the conviction of Samuel D. Sage for violating the Federal
    Support Child Recovery Act.  Sage, who pleaded guilty to
    willfully failing to pay child support for his two children
    residing in Connecticut, was arrested in Ohio.  This decision
    affirms that crossing state borders to avoid paying child support
    is a federal ~rime.
