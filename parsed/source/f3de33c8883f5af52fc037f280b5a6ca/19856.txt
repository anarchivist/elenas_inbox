     TEXT:
     A hearing is scheduled for Wed., May 20 on S.1645. This bill will
     prohibit taking minors across State Lines to avoid laws requiring the
·

involvement of parents in abortion decisions.

In talking to Bill and Peter on this today, we believe we need to get an
internal working group together on this sooner vs. later. The groups are
calling and wanting to meet with some of us just before or after the
hearing, but not a good idea until we get together first.

We'd like to get a group together on Thursday if possible.   Please
advise.  thanks
