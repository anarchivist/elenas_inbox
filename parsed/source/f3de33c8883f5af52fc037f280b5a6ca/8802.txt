House Votes To Nix Gay Rights Money
By H. JOSEF HEBERT

      WASHINGTON -- Despite charges of bigotry and interference in local
government, the House on Wednesday voted to prohibit the spending of
federal money on programs implementing a gay-rights ordinance in San
Francisco.
      The measure, offered by Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., was approved
214-212 as an amendment to a spending bill for housing, veterans programs,
environmental protection, space and funding for the arts.
      Supporters said they hoped to get the provision removed during
negotiations to reconcile the House bill with a yet-to-be approved Senate
version.
      The Riggs amendment prohibits any money in the $94 billion spending
bill to be used to implement a San Francisco ordinance that requires
employers doing business with the city to provide health and other
benefits to same-sex partners.
      "We should not force or coerce (private business) to adopt policies
they find morally objectionable," Riggs argued'in a heated debate.
     Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., called it a "mean-spirited, bigoted
amendment"   and other opponents said it was an assault on local autonomy.
"It attacks home rule in every city in America, " declared Rep. Dennis
Kucinich, D-Ohio, a former mayor of Cleveland.
      "It's a move back to the days of witch hunting, back to the days of
telling people what they should and should not do, " complained Rep. Danny
Davis, D-III. He said the amendment threatens programs in San Francisco
that help the homeless and the treatment of,AIDS patients as well as
scores of other programs that rely in part on federal support.
     Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the city negotiated with Catholic
Charities, which had balked at the ordinance, and reached an
accommodation, and compromises were expected to be worked out with other
businesses.


      "I don't know why Mr. Riggs wants to create a war, " she said in
strong opposition to the measure. Pelosi, who represents San Francisco,
called the amendment an affront to home rule and said "the city of San
Francisco is not forcing anyone to act against their principles."
      More than a dozen lawmakers spoke emotionally against the amendment,
characterizing it as an attack on gay rights and a federal imposition on
local rule. Only Riggs vigorously supported it during the debate.
      "It's a message amendment . . . . It will unquestionably encourage
intolerance,"   said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
      The San Francisco ordinance has been criticized by some businesses as
well as nonprofit organizations including Catholic Charities and the
Salvation Army.
      "The Salvation Army, which refused to buckle to city policy,
forfeited $3.5 million of its $18 million budget,"      said Riggs, because it
didn't want to comply with the city ordinance on domestic partner
benefits.
      The Human Rights Campaign, the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, called the amendment "the latest salvo in
right-wing attacks against gay people. ' ,
      "The amendment is a thinly veiled attempt to attack San Francisco and
micromanage the city, " said Winnie Stachelberg, the political director
for the Human Rights Campaign.
      In another action of interest to the gay community, the House decided
to reduce money it had allocated for housing programs earmarked for people
with AIDS. The $21 million was shifted to help finance state extended care
programs for veterans.
     Rep. Van Hilleary, R-Tenn., said the reduction was justified because
of a 6 percent decline in the annual number of AIDS cases.
     Opponents of the amendment argued that the decline is attributed to
the wider use of new drugs and the success of such drug treatments often
depends on patients having decent housing.
