Bruce/Elena:

with your permission, I'm going to leave a bit early on Friday and head
out to Chicago to see the Bulls/Jazz game.  Please let me know if you
think that doesn't work; otherwise, I intend to buy a plane ticket and
fill out the necessary paperwork today.

Thanks much.

Jose'

(I'm also thinking about take off 22 days in July to go see the Tour de
France and sample a bit of wine and cheese. What do you think? Is that
doable? Maybe I'll just have to catch it on ESPN ... )
