TEXT:
Once again, we're looking for strong, news-making events the VP could do
in October, to show that he is moving ahead on key priorities (new
economy, education/technology, tobacco, environment, family issues,  etc.)
and I wanted to check in to see if you folks had anything in the hopper
that might be appropriate ...

We especially want to do something on tobacco, so any ideas in that area
are welcome (something focussing on Congressional action?); plus anything
else that might be floating around ...

As always, many, many thanks for any help on this ...
