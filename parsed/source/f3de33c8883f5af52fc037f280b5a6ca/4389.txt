                     DECLINING MINORITY COLLEGE ADMISSIONS

Background: Recently the Washington Post reported that the number of black students
admitted to UCLA law school dropped by 80% in one year and is now the lowest since the early
1970s. UC Berkeley admitted just 14 black students out of a class of792, down from 75 in
1996. And at the University of Texas, nearly 400 fewer blacks and Hispanics have been offered
undergraduate admission, a 20% drop in one year. Meanwhile, white and Asian admissions are
up in both states. In both states the sharp declines in minority admissions are attributed to
roll-backs of affirmative action--in California, by the UC Board of Regents, and in Texas by the
5th Circuit's Hopwood decision.

Question:     Are you concerned about recent reports of declining enrollments of minority
              students in postsecondary education?

Answer:       These declines are disturbing and completely unacceptable. Educational
              opportunity is the touchstone of the American dream, and figures like this raise a
              serious concern that the doors of college education are being closed to minority
              students. In addition, diversity in education helps prepare all our students to be
              productive citizens in the 21 st century, so these developments should concern
              every American.


Question:     What is your administration doing to address this problem?

Answer:       We are working on several fronts to address this issue:

       ·      We will continue to intervene in litigation in support of appropriate affirmative
              action programs. The Department of Education is looking for a good opportunity
              to challenge the Hopwood decision, and the Department of Justice has filed a brief
              challenging California's Proposition 209.

       ·      The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education is conducting a review
              of the Texas higher education system to ensure that Texas has eliminated all
              remnants of its former de jure segregated system.

       ·      And, more broadly, the Administration is pressing higher education officials to
              pmaintain and expand diversity, and offering assistance to them to do so. For
              example, we have called on colleges and universities burdened by new legal
              restrictions to develop new and creative approaches to achieving diversity, such as
              aggressively recruiting in secondary schools with high percentages of minority
              students and forming educational partnerships with such schools.
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

   Q     Mr. President, your scholarship proposal
notwithstanding, there is still an assault on affirmative action
in this country. In my home state of California in the wake of
Proposition 209 and last year's vote by the University of
California Board of Regents, minority applications and enrollment
in the UC system this year are down. There will be not one new
black student enrolled at the prestigious Bolt Hall School of Law
at the University of California this fall. What specific
programs, scholarship program notwithstanding, do you propose to
stem this tide and make sure that there is diversity in higher
education in this country? (Applause.)

              THE PRESIDENT: First of all, I think we need to
make sure that we continue to use federal law to the maximum
extent we can to promote an integrated educational environment -
(applause) -- so that we have to review, whether in the Education
Department, in the Justice Department, whether there are any
further actions we can take legally to promote an integrated
educational environment in higher education in the states where
these actions have been taken.

               Secondly, I think we need to look at whether there
is some way by indirection to achieve the same result. I know
that the legislature in Texas, in an attempt to overcome the
impact of the Hopwood decision in Texas, just passed what they
call the "Ten Percent Solution," which would be to guarantee
admissions to any Texas public institution of higher education to
the top 10 percent of the graduating class of any high school in
Texas. And because of the way the African Americans and
Hispanics living patterns are in Texas, that may solve the
problem. Whether that would work in California, I don't know.
haven't studied the way the school districts are organized
enough. But I think we have to come up with some new and fairly
innovative ways to do that.




               Thirdly, I think, on the professional schools, my
own view - I'm a little stumped here. We have to really-
we're going to have to reexamine what we can do. I don't know
why the people who promoted this in California think it's a good
thing to have a segregated set of professional schools. It would
seem to me that, since these professionals are going to be
operating in the most ethnically-diverse state in the country,
they would want them to be educated in an environment like
they're going to operate. I don't understand that. (Applause.)
               But there may be some ways to get around it, and
we're looking at it and working on it. But I think it's going to
be easier to stop it from happening at the undergraduate level
than at the professional school level. And we're going to have
to really think about whether there is some way around it,
whether it would be some sort of economic designation or
something else. But we're working on that.
               And finally, let me say, I think we need to continue            Hex·Dump Conversion
to provide more resources, because one of the real problems we
have is, even in the last five years, when we've had economic
recovery, the college enrollment rates of minorities in America
have not gone up in an appropriate way. And in this budget that
I'm trying to get passed through Congress, we've got the biggest
increase in education funding in 32 years, the biggest increase
in Pell Grant scholarships in 20 years, another huge increase in
work-study funds, and the tax proposal, as we structured them,
would, in effect, guarantee two years of college to virtually
everyone in America and help people with two more years of
college.

                We've got a huge dropout problem in higher education
among minorities that I think is having an impact on then what
happens in the graduate schools and in the professional schools.
I don't think there is a simple answer. And I think, frankly,
the way 209 is worded, it's a bigger problem even than the
Hopwood case in Texas. But I can tell you we're working on it:
first, is there anything the Justice Department or the Civil
Rights Office of the Education Department can do? We're
examining that. Second, is there a specific solution like the
Texas "Ten Percent Solution" that would overcome it at least in a
specific state. Third, come up with some more funds and some
more specific scholarship programs to try to overcome it.

               It's a great concern to me, and I think it is moving
the country in exactly the wrong direction. And I might say, if
you look at the performance of affirmative action students, it
doesn't justify the action that was taken. That's another point
that ought to be made.

              So the one thing that I believe is, I believe that
.the rather shocking consequences in the professional schools in
 both Texas and California will have a deterrent impact on other


actions like that in other states. And I believe you will see
more efforts now to avoid this. I think a lot of people who even
voted for 209 have been pretty shocked at what happened and I
don't believe the people of California wanted that to occur. And
I think the rhetoric sounded better than the reality to a lot of
voters.

                So I can tell you that, while I'm very concerned
about it, I think if we all work on it, we can reverse it in a
matter of a couple of years. And we just have to hope we don't
lose too many people who would otherwise have had good
opportunities because of it. But it is an urgent matter of
concern to me. (Applause.)
