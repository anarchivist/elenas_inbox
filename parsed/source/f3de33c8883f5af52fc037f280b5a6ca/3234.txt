TEXT:
Update: Michael Deich spoke with Seth Waxman and David Ogden this morning
about OMB's concerns with the directive. According to OMB, Justice agreed
in principle to include budget language. OMB sent me their proposed
language which they gave to Justice this afternoon.    I have a call into
Justice see where. they are on the language.  I'll let you know what I find
out.

I've put the language on the fax to you.
