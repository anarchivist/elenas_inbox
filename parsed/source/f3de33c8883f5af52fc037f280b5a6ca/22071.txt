Q.   If federal employees in the Executive Branch are subject to drug testing, why isn't
     the President also subject to tests?

A.   The reason the President is not subject to drug testing is the same reason that Members of
     Congress are also not tested: since they serve at the will of the people who elected them--
     and not any other "employer"-- they could not be removed from their positions for failing
     a drug test. This policy could be changed for Members of Congress and the President,
     but it would require Congressional action.
