      SClinton won't support Secret Service bid to unionize
          WASHINGTON (AP)    President Clinton has decided reluctantly not
      to support efforts by the Secret Service's uniformed division to
      unionize, the president's spokesman said Tuesday.
           --I think the president regrets that, but that's the
      situation, " press secretary Mike McCurry said.
           In announcing their intention to hold a protest rally outside
      the White House on Wednesday, the Fraternal Order of Police said
      Clinton had promised in September 1996 to help the Secret Service
      uniformed division win collective bargaining rights.
           --Despite meetings and promises, the administration has done
      nothing to address the concerns of federal officers and done
      nothing to deliver on the president's promise,"   said Gilbert G.
      Gallegos, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police.
          The uniformed Secret Service officers guard the White House
      inside and out from fixed posts; the plainclothes agents are the
      ones who shield the president himself wherever he goes.
          Tim Richardson, a spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police,
      said in an interview that Clinton had told a meeting of his
      organization's executive board in September 1996 that it would be
      hypocritical of him not to support collective bargaining. Of
      McCurry's statement about Clinton's change of heart, Richardson
      said, --We have to look on this as a broken pledge."
          McCurry said presidential aides had reviewed the union matter
      and concluded that the Secret Service should not be granted an
      exception to a Nov. 19, 1979 presidential executive order which
      said that, for national security reasons, the right to unionize did
      not apply to the Secret Service.
          He disputed a suggestion that Clinton's earlier promise to


    support unionization was a mistake. When asked why Clinton had made
    the promise before the matter was reviewed, McCurry replied, " I
    think that's a very good question."  He said he could not answer
    it.                                          .
        Many federal government agencies are denied collective
    bargaining rights based on national security. They include the
    Customs Service's Office of Investigations, the Treasury's Office
    of Intelligence Support and many agencies and offices of the
    Defense Department.
