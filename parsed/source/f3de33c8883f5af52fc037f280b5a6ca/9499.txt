TEXT:
FYI. After my conversation with HHS this evening, it became clear that
extending the period of time for HMOs to advise us of their participation
in Medicare would make us look weaker.  Instead, we are going to send out
a letter from HCFA tomorrow that outlines our intention to reduce the
regulatory burdens and address their major administrative concerns.   It
will start out with a specific and strong rejection of the HMO industry's
request to have flexibility to increase cost sharing and decrease
benefits. This will be the first written notification to the industry of
our strong position. However, our position should be in some of the
papers tomorrow, as Nancy Ann discussed it with a number of media outlets
today.

Call with any questions.
