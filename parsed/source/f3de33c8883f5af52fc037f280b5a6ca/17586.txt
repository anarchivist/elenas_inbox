TEXT:
The White House plans to announce the President's use of his line-item
veto on the VA/HUD and Transportation appropriations bills this Saturday.
We plan to issue paper in Washington and on the road with the President.

To prepare you, OMB will once again hold a briefing on the specifics --
this time on Friday, at 3 p.m., .in the Roosevelt Room.

We are squeezing in the briefing between other events in the Roosevelt
Room, so we should start on time or close to it.

Thanks.
