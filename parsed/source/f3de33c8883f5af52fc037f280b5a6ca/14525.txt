 TEXT:
 Attached is a one page uninsured stat sheet to help clarify any reference
 to the 40 million uninsured in the nation.  If we are going to use the
 number, we should not suggest that all of the uninsured come from working
 families; it is a very large number, however, -- 85 percent.  In addition,
 if you continue to use the sentence in the SOTU address, please make
 certain that you reference it prior to any discussion of POTUS health
 expansion initiatives. In the last document I saw, it was referenced
 after the listing of initiatives, making it seem that his proposal. were
 not addressing the uninsured.

 If we need any more health care references or need some quick fact checks,
 please call or page me at any time.  I think the health care sections
 provide a good start, but need some work.
 Talk to you soon.
