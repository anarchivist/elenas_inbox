Subject:         Re: PIs examine re: housing vouchers and welfare to work

Your point is well taken.   Yes, I think you should host the mtg.




My memo had said:

I agree that we should not set national criteria about which welfare
recipients should get the vouchers, but instead should let the local
proj·ect applicants propose a plan that meets local needs. I think that
flexibility should extend to letting applicants decide whether or not to
restrict vouchers to those currently living in public housing.

While we want to encourage mobility from public housing to better
neighborhoods, we don't want to preclude a voucher from being used, say,
to help a welfare mother doubled up with relatives in a private apartment
move into her own apartment - - perhaps in a new n,eighborhood - - if that
move would help her make the transition from welfare to work.

Thus, I think the wording in the State of the union Ideas memo to the


President was more restrictive than it should have been. Rather than say
the purpose of the 50,000 new vouchers would be "to help welfare'
recipients in public housing who need to move in order to find empioyment"
I would say the purpose is "to help welfare recipients who need to move in
order to find employment."

Andrea is now re-writing NEC's draft memo to the President, which we hope
to share with Paul/Jose/Julie by tomorrow morning and Bruce/Elena soon
thereafter.  Paul hopes to get the memo into the President by the end of
the week and will coordinate with NEC.

Also, Andrea and I are tentatively planning to host a DPC-NEC-OMB-HUD-HHS
meeting on Monday to hammer out the additional details we would need for
the budget process. Do you folks think that makes sense? I don't see any
reason why OMB should continue to be the convener.



Bruce had said:

Thanks. I still think it's a mistake to worry too much about targeting.
It's hard for anybody to move from welfare to work and from public housing
to a dec~nt neighborhood.



I had said:

Bruce -- I, of course, like our proposal better than Barry's, but I should
note that under our proposal, publi'c housing authorities could propose to
give vouchers to any type of welfare recipient. These recipients would
not necessarily already be living in public housing, nor would they
necessarily be a targetted, hard-to-serve population.

Here's why (housing folks -- please correct me if I'm wrong):

Historically, federal law required that families with "urgent housing
needs" -- defined as those that pay more than half their income in rent,
live in substandard housing, were homeless, or have been involuntarily
displaced from their housing -- be given preference for a substantial
share of housing subsidies.   Thus, historically, they were a pretty need
group.

However, the HUD appropriations bills for FY 1996, 1997, and 1998
suspended these preference requirements, so now public housing authorities
can target as they see fit, so long as a family's income is less than 50
percent of the area median and the 30 percent of their income they pay in
rent under the voucher does not exceed the area fair market rent. The new
House and Senate bills, per the Center on Budget, permanently abolish the
old preference system and substitute a much less target ted definition.

Thus, compared to other welfare recipients, the welfare recipients who
would get housing assistance under our proposal would be "a pretty
targeted crowd" only to the extent that a) the public housing authorities
rationally chose them and/or b) we selected such proposals during the
competitive process.   However, the welfare recipients getting vouchers
would be a targetted group compared to other families receiving vouchers.
