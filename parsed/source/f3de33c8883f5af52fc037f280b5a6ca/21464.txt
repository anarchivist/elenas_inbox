TEXT:
There has been much confusion between DOJ and OMB.  I have finally gotten
solid confirmation on this:  there is not Haitian language in the
conference report.  The Rules committee is meeting at 5pm to decide on the
rule to bring the conference report to the House floor.  It may come to
floor as early as tonight.
