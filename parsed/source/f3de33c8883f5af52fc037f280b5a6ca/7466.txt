MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

FROM:                 BRUCE REED
                      ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:              USDA's Proposed Organic Rule

       In 1990, Congress passed the Organic Food Production Act which required the
Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a national standard defining the use of the term
"organic" for use on food products. In December 1997, USDA published a proposed regulation
to establish a national organic standard. Since that time, the proposed rule has been the subject
of extensive criticism.

        The primary complaint concerning the proposed rule has been that it does not explicitly
prohibit the use of genetically modified organisms, irradiation, and biosolids (sludge) in food that
could be labeled "organic." In the preamble to its proposal, USDA had requested comments as
to whether foods using any of these techniques could be considered as organic. In response,
USDA received almost 200,000 comments regarding the proposed rule, the most ever received
for a USDA rulemaking. The rule has also been the subject of unfavorable editorials in many
newspapers including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, and the
Los Angles Times. ( Sample "Organic Hash From the USDA Kitchen"). Finally, 47 members
of the House and 30 Senators have signed letters to Secretary Glickman expressing concern about
the proposed rule.


Current Status
       Secretary Glickman proposes to issue a press release this Friday, May 7th, indicating
that USDA will "make fundamental changes in the new proposed rule on organic standards."
Specifically, the statement would indicate that biotechnology, irradiation, and biosolids are
"being taken off the table and will not be included in our new proposal." Articles in the last
week in USA TODAY, and the Washington Post have indicated that USDA is preparing such a
statement.

        Representatives ofOMB and NEC have expressed disagreement with USDA's plan to
issue a statement taking these techniques "off the table." These agencies argue that consumers
will view a product labeled as organic as safe, despite the fact that there is not evidence to
demonstrate that organic food is any safer than non-organic food, or that genetically modified,
irradiated, or food grown using sludge is unsafe. These agencies have alternately suggested that
the organic label be modified to include a provision stating something along the lines of
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

"organic food may be no more or less safe than non-organic food" or that USDA continue its
comment review process and not prematurely prohibit using the term organic for food using any
of the three disputed techniques.

       USDA responds that the organic label is not intended to signify the overall safety of the
food, only the methods by which the food was produced. USDA argues that the disputed
techniques are not in keeping with the public's expectation of what constitutes organic. The
Food and Drug Administration has expressed support for USDA's position.

Recommendation
         We recommend that Secretary Glickman issue a clear statement taking biotechnology,
irradiation, and sludge off the table for purposes of the new rulemaking. In order to better
understand how the labels will be used, OMB has suggested USDA and FDA conduct a survey
on consumer attitudes towards organic food to determine whether consumers purchase organic
products on the basis of unproven safety claims. USDA has not objected to conducting such a
survey. USDA has also agreed to insert in the preamble of its new rule language indicating that
the National Organic Standard Board should report regulaily to the Secretary on possible uses of
new technologies and whether they might meet an organic standard. In addition, we recommend
that USDA raise for discussion in its next proposed rule the possibility that a private industry
body be responsible for formulating a nationwide organic standard.
