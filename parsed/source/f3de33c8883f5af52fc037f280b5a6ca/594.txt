Message Creation Date was at 22-JAN-1997 20:18:00

TO:   DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
  DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: JANUARY 22, 1997



SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Yesterday, the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) was introduced in the Senate as
S.J.Res. 1, with 62 sponsors -- all.55 Senate Republicans, plus Democrats
Baucus, Breaux, Bryan, Graham, Kohl, Moseley-Braun, and Robb.  The Amendment
does not include the Nunn language from last year, which retained CongressO,
authority to determine the extent that courts can get involved in enforcement.
Lott's likely intention is to add the Nunn language on the Floor if it is
required to lock down a vote.  The language of S.J.Res. 1 is identical to the
House resolution.

Also on Tuesday, the Senate passed H.J.Res 25, Technical Amendments to the
Omnibus Appropriations Act, by Unanimous Consent.  In addition, Senators
Murkowsi and Craig reintroduced the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste legislation.

Hearings:
Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee held their second hearing on the Balanced
Budget Constitutional Amendment. Witnesses included Senators Craig, Conrad,
Dorgan, Lautenberg, Bryan, and Graham, former Senator Paul Simon, and former
AARP President Gene Lehrman.

Tomorrow, Jack Lew will testify before the Senate Budget Committee on the
AdministrationO,s Medicare Plan.

Director Raines will testify on the PresidentO,s Budget before the following
committees:
Friday, 2/7 Senate Budget Committee
Tuesday, 2/11 House Budget Committee
Wednesday, 2/26 Joint Economic Committee


CONGRESS TODAY (1/22)

SENATE:
The Senate today confirmed Madeline Albright as Secretary of State by a vote of
99-0, and confirmed William Cohen as Secretary of Defense, also by a vote of 99
-0.

HOUSE:
Out of Session

CONGRESS TOMORROW (1/23)

SENATE:
The Senate will be in session on Thursday to allow Members to make remarks on
nominations and to offer legislation.  There will not be any votes.


CONGRESS -- LONG TERM SCHEDULE:

SENATE:
The Senate will be out of session on Friday, January 24th, but will return on
Monday for a pro forma session. The week of January 27th, the Senate will
continue its consideration of nominations. The Balanced Budget Amendment is
expected to be on the floor most of February.

Week of January 27
Consider Nominations


Specific schedule to be determined

Week of February 3
Begin consideration of the Balanced Budget Amendment. The Senate Republican
Leadership plans to vote on its passage after PresidentO,s Day Recess in order
to use the time to build public support.

February 14-23
PresidentO,s Day Recess

March 22 - April 6
Easter Recess


HOUSE:
The House returns on February 4th, for the PresidentO,s State of the Union
address. They plan to be in session on the 4th, 5th, and 6th, but do not plan
to have any major votes. The agenda will likely include a list of suspension
bills, yet to be named.

During the week of February 10th and throughout the month, the House will
likely consider the following four major items:
1 Term limits legislation -- Though this bill originally was placed first on
calendar,  Republicans now do not want to consider the legislation first
because they do not want their first vote to be a loss.
2 Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment -- The House will take up the bill
after it is considered in the Senate.
3 UN Population Control Reauthorization bill
4 Comp Time legislation

February 14 - February 24
PresidentO,s Day Recess

March 22 - April 7
