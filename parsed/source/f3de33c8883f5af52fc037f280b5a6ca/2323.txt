TEXT:
1. Disregard first question about meeting with groups on suspension.    Rob
told me meeting is happening on Thursday.

2. We should try to talk with Rob for 10 minutes tomorrow (Wednesday)
about process for circulating a memo and timing for an interagency
meeting. Anytime after noon is good for me.
