TEXT:
As I have mentioned, ~ need your hard-hitting questions and tight answers
with the back-up by COB today for the President's press conference
briefing book.  I don't want reams of ~aper from your shop, but enough


material to properly prepare the President for this press conference on
Monday. Thank you.
