                            DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


            I am deeply disappointed in today's Supreme Court decision to rule part of the Brady Law
    unconstitutional. The Brady Law has served as a key law enforcement tool -- keeping guns out
    of the hands of over 186,000 felons, fugitives, and stalkers. The Brady Law has made a
    difference. It has helped us drive down the crime rate and save lives.

             Today's ruling should not mean an end to Brady background checks. Twenty-eight
    states -- ten more than when the Brady Law first passed -- now conduct background checks as a
    matter of state law and will continue to do so.

           We expect that the majority of law enforcement agencies in the remaining states will
    continue to conduct background checks-- not because they are required by federal law-- but
    because they are good law enforcement policy. I have asked Attorney General Reno and
    Treasury Secretary Rubin to contact police departments across the country today, to make sure
    they know that Brady background checks can continue to be done on a voluntary basis through
    November 1998, when our federal Brady instant check system is in effect.

            But we should not stop there. I challenge Congress to quickly pass legislation (being
    introduced today by Congressman Schumer) to prohibit a federally-licensed gun dealer from
    selling a handgun unless a law enforcement official has certified that a background check will be
    conducted. Our goal is clear: no background check, no handgun.

            Over the weekend, we received encouraging news from the Justice Department that last
    year, we saw the largest drop in violent crime in more than three and a half decades. Murders
    dropped a stunning 11 percent in 1996. Our strategy of more police, tougher punishments, and
    fewer guns in the hands of criminals is making difference. But we cannot let up. The safety
    of our communities and of all Americans is better assured when Brady background checks are
    conducted.
