    DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE
    March 16, 1998
    (House)

    H.R. 2294 - Federal Courts Improvement Act
    (Coble (R) North Carolina)

    The Administration supports several provision of H.R. 2294 that would
    improve the Administration of Federal courts.  The Administration,
    however, opposes House passage of the bill because it would:

     Require an annual transfer of funds from the Justice and Treasury Asset
    Forfeiture Funds to the Judiciary to cover certain costs including the
    costs of adjudicating civil and criminal forfeiture cases and providing
    counsel to indigent defendants in such cases.  This provision could appear
    to represent a conflict of interest for the Judiciary in that it may
    obtain a pecuniary benefit from decisions forfeiting assets or funds to
    the United States.  In addition, asset forfeiture funds already are used
    to pay lien holders, victims of crime committed by the defendant, or
    others with superior rights.   (Section 101)

     Require the transfer of employer contributions from the Civil Service
    Retirement and Disability (CSRD) Fund to a judicial branch courts
    operation fund when judges elect to transfer service credit from the CSRD
    system to the judicial officers retirement system .. This is an
    inappropriate transfer of funds, since they represent assets used ·to


 provide survivorship protection to judges while they were covered by the
 CSRD Fund retirement systems.  (Section 102)

  Vest magistrate judges with criminal contempt authority in certain
 instances.  Giving contempt authority to non-Article III judges raises
 constitutional concerns.  (Section 202)

  Extend to jurors coverage under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act
 while going to and from jury duty.  This provision undercuts the
 longstanding general principle that workers' compensation coverage is not
 provided for travel to and from work.  (Section 407)

 The Administration also has concerns regarding provisions of H.R. 2294
 which would provide 90-day annual leave carryover to "designated
                                                       I
 executives."

 Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

 H.R. 2294 is subject to the "pay-as-you-go" requirement (PAYGO) of the
 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Administration's PAYGO
 estimate for this bill is under development, but the preliminary analysis
 of the bill suggests that H.R. 2294 may result in substantial increases in
 direct spending. Any bill that would increase mandatory spending or
 result in a net revenue loss could contribute to a sequester of mandatory
 programs as called for in the Budget Enforcement Act.  As a result, if the
 bill were enacted, any deficit effects could contribute to a sequester of
 mandatory spending.
