TEXT:
Apparently Ron Haskins is keeping this very close. He only mentioned it
to Deborah Coulton at 4 p.m, who in turn mentioned it to HHS congressional
office.   Ron has promised to share a 2 pager with Deborah late tonight or
first thing tomorrow a.m.   She'll pass along to HHS who will share with
us.     The only new information is that the press conference will take
place at a community center here in D.C.    (possibly one of Charles
Ballard's programs??).

Subject:         Republicans to Announce Fatherhood Block Grants TOMORROW

I just heard that these will be unveiled at a press conference at 10 a.m.
tomorrow I Sounds like Shaw will introduce a bill, with strong
encouragement from Archer.   This comes as quite a surprise given that no
one seems to have had any specifics as of a week ago.  HHS Congressional
folks are trying to track down more information.
