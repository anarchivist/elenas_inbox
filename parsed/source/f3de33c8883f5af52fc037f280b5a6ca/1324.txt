I cc you religiously on all email to Bruce, except I haven't been doing so
consistently on the summit. Here's a very recent example. Do you want to
be cc'd on this too?

Subject:         Communications and the summit

FYI, I understand that the Summit-Edelman relationship is not going that
well.  Ray Chambers is now bringing in some of his own people to
supplement/oversee Edelman's efforts (someone from General Mills and
Bozell(?», and has some kind of informal group advising him on message.
I spoke to Jay Winsten of Harvard, who is supposedly part of that group.
Edelman is supposedly overwhelmed and asking for more money.

I also hear there may be a story in tomorrow's Philadelphia Inquirer
critical of the summit, including whether the commitments are for real.
