TEXT:
Harkin's staff have asked for help:

1. Correlating different size industry payments to the likely resulting
per pack price increases.

2.  Selecting the right penalties, especially can we recommend the best
mix of industry-wide vs. company specific penalties.  Also our thoughts on
penalty caps.

3. Deciding whether there should be any anti-trust provisions in their
bill.

They would like this help by tomorrow.     Either a meeting or conference
call would work.  Thanks.
