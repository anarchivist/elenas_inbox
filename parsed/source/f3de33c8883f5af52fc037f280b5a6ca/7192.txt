 TEXT:
 FYI, Rep. Shaw held a hearing today on SSI as a high risk program.   He is
 working on a package of proposals to toughen up on fraud and overpayment,
 a few of which cross the line into reducing benefits.  SSA testified on
'what it's doing, and would also like our clearance of its bill to do
 things similar to Shaw -- tougher fraud penalties, more access to
 financial information about beneficiaries to prevent overpayments, etc.
 so we are working with OMB to evaluate them.  If the radio address is
 still on, maybe they'll fit in there.   Shaw may want to attach some of
 his proposals later this month to a "return to work" bill for people with
 disabilities that has no funding source at the moment.
