Re: the possible race/service announcement in the current State of the
Union draft, see the attached. Are you guys in favor of trying to do
something like this? i.e., trying to line up some churches, etc. that
would agree in advance to take up the President's challenge to organize
service across racial lines? It would be tough to organize something big
in 2 weeks, but we could try -- Harris could help in reaching out to
people. Or do you think this won't work, and you're trying to substitute
the college mentoring initiative into that section of the speech?

I thought that what we were hoping was that a group of religious
organizations would organize in a way that allowed the President to
challenge (lightly) folks to participate and call their local branch of
xyz synagogue or the branch of the National Council of churches. Do we
think that something like that is possible>

     The idea that we came up with was to see if we can't identify five
     religous organizations who will commit to a day of service to the
     community as a way of fostering racial reconciliations--something like
     that.  It's in the thinking stage and of course we should see how it
     intersects with the service summit--ideas?

     Was there a discussion in a meeting on race this morning about the
     intersection between race and service, where it was agreed that your
     office would take some steps? I got somewhat confused reporting on the
     meeting.  Steve and I have been integrally involved in service and in
     planning a service event for MLK day, and wanted to make sure we were in
     the loop.
