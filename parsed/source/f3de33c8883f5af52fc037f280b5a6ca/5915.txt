TEXT:
I know it's very unusual to have so many options, but Stephen Goodin (who
has been very involved in this) insists that he wants to make this choice
himself, and that if we don't give him enough he will somehow get his
hands on the Corporation's list of 70 communities that got MLK Day grants
and go through them all by himself.  So there's a history here.

I'll make the other changes you wanted.    Thanks.

Looks good to me, but (I) I think the Americorps glossery should go up
front, so that he knows what Young Heroes, CityYear, etc. are as he's
reading the options; (2) do we really need to give him 11 options? aren't
the first five enough?; and (3) I don't think white and black are
capitalized.
