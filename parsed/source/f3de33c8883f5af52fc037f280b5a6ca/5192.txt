TEXT:
As of this evening:

Central Americans-- Looks like this is back on DC Approps, which the
Senate has yet to pass. Kennedy is holding the Central Americans piece to
add Haitians and NJB. He is also trying to get a relaxed suspension
standard (from "extreme hardship" to "hardship") for the ABC class, but
will probably pull back on this.  Peter is hoping yesterday's letter will
give us some leverage with the CBC and Hispanic Caucus when the House
votes on the DC bill. Timing on DC still unclear.

245(i)-- The CJS conference is meeting tomorrow at 9:00am. The Senate
(Gregg) is suuuposedly still holding firm on a permanent extension.
Despite the strong House vote on motion to instruct last week, House
conferees will be looking to compromise through some sort of grandfather
provision. The current thinking is that a limited clean extension (2-5
years) of 245(i) is preferable to a grandfathering provision-- which we
might be able to get after the extension expires.  INS has been working
with Abraham to get numbers on how much revenue would be lost through
grandfathering.
