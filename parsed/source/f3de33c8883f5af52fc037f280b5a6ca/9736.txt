                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
Must-have items:

       o a fonnula that is targeted

       o the report card and accountability provisions

       o the changes to the Purpose


Non-Starter Items that must be deleted because they drain resources from class size
funding:

       o in the 4th bullet under Uses of Funds, delete "costs associated with teaching children
       identified with special needs"                     .

       o any use of funds for instructional materials

Can Trade Away:

      o in Special Priorities -- delete language we added on "teacher oflimited-English
      proficient students, teachers in subjectare with a shortage of qualified teachers, and
      teachers in large class sizes."

Fall-Back Positions:

      Funding fonnula -- If the Republicans reject using the Title I formula for State and within
      State distribution, propose using the Title VI formula for distribution to States, and Title I
      for sub-state distribution. This will focus funds within States on higher poverty areas.

      Local Control-- If you cannot delete "Local Control", then get it modified:

              A) so that it bases LEA determination on "has met its goals for reducing class size
              in regular classrooms and raising student achievement"; or

              B) to base the determination on achievement of an average class size of 18.

      Maintenance of Effort -- If our proposed MOE language is not acceptable, we will
      propose alternative MOE language.
