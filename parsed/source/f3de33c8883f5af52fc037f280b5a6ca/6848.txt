                                         Tobacco Q&As
                                         March 30, 1998
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:     What is Erskine Bowles going to say in his speech today?

A:      He will say that protecting our children from the threat of tobacco is at the top of the
        President's agenda, and this administration is fully committed to working with the
        bipartisan leadership in Congress to achieve this goal. He will praise Senator McCain's
        leadership in drafting a bipartisan tobacco bill, which is expected to be released today.
        While we need to review the bill in detail, Mr. Bowles will say that based on what we
        have heard, we expect to see room for significant improvement in the McCain bill.
        Perhaps most important, we want to impose stronger penalties on companies that
        continue to sell cigarettes to our children. And we are disappointed that the McCain bill
        doesn't try to comprehensively address the question of how best to use tobacco revenues
      . to protect public health and help our children.

Q:     So is the Administration supporting or opposing the McCain bill?

A:.    We see room for significant improvement in the McCain bill, but believe it is a very
       strong foundation for further action. We believe the bill will make significant inroads on
       youth smoking by increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes substantially -- by $1.10
       within five years -- and restricting both the advertising aimed at young people and their
       access to tobacco products. And we believe the bill will give the FDA the full authority
       it needs to regulate tobacco products and will protect farmers and farming communities.
       We look forward to working with Senator McCain and others in the Commerce
       Committee and the full Senate to strengthen this bill by imposing stronger penalties on
       companies that continue to sell cigarettes to our children and to ensure that tobacco
       revenues protect public health and help our children.

Q:     Does this mean that the Administration prefers the Conrad, Fazio, and
       Chafee-Harkin-Graham bills?

A:      The President has indicated his support for the Conrad, Fazio, and
        Chafee-Harkin-Graham bills. Each of these bills meet the President's call for a bill
        which: 1) Raises the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 a pack over the next ten years and
        imposes tough penalties on companies that continue to sell to kids; 2) Expressly confirms
        the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products; 3) Gets tobacco companies out of the
        business of marketing to children; 4) Furthers public health research and goals; and 5)
        Protects tobacco farmers and their communities. The Conrad and Fazio bills better
      . match the Administration's budget priorities. But the President is heartened by the
        bipartisan nature of the Chafee-Harkin bill, because he knows that such support is critical
        to enacting legislation this year.
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

Q:   Are you saying that the McCain bill does not meet the President's five principles?

A:   By not including strong company-specific penalties and not adequately funding public
     health research and goals, Senator McCain's bill has room for significant improvement.

Q:   What is your view of the liability protections for the tobacco industry contained in
     Senator McCain's legislation?

A:   As we have said on many occasions, we would prefer comprehensive tobacco legislation
     without liability limits, but in the context oflegislation that meets all of the President's
     principles and dramatically reduces youth smoking, reasonable limits on liability will not
     be a dealbreaker. Right now, we're going to focus on the aspects of the McCain
     legislation that we think fall short of what the President has demanded: particularly, on
     the penalties in the bill to reduce youth smoking. Until we get those right, we won't
     consider liability protections.

     We do understand that that the McCain bill has a very interesting idea about trying to tum
     liability protections into a public health tool. As we understand it, the McCain bill
     would in some respects make liability protections contingent on a company's efforts to
     reduce youth smoking. That proposal has to be looked at in much greater detail -- we
     would have to ensure that the threat of losing liability protections is real, and not just a
     pretense
     -- but we believe it is worth serious consideration.

Q:   You say the Administration needs stronger penalties on companies that continue to
     sell to our children. What do you mean by that?

A:   We believe it is· critically important that legislation provide strong financial incentives for
     every tobacco company to significantly reduce youth smoking. Last September, the
     President called for legislation to set targets to cut teen smoking by 30% in 5 years, 50%
     in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years. We believe the Congress should include financial
     penalties on companies that fail to meet these targets based on how far they are from
     reaching them. For example, a company could be required to pay a one cent per pack.
     surcharge for every percentage point by which it misses the targets, meaning a company
     missing the targets by 10 percentage points would pay a 10 cents per pack surcharge and a
     company missing by 30 percentage points would pay a 30 cents per pack surcharge.

Q:   Does the Administration support the farmers component to the McCain bill?

A:   As we have said, we have not yet been able to review the' bill in detail, but we are pleased
     that Senators Ford, Robb, Hollings, and Frist have agreed upon a package which provides
     broad-based protection for farmers and farming communities. This proposal is clearly a
     promising effort to craft a bipartisan consensus which protects farmers and their

                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
     communities, and we will be examining it closely.
Q:   You also express concerns about Senator McCain's bill not directing tobacco
     revenues toward efforts to improve the public health and help children. What's
     missing from the McCain bill?

A:   We do not yet know whether Senator McCain's bill includes any public health spending,
     The President strongly believes that tobacco revenues should go toward protecting public
     health and assisting children. His budget provides for funds for anti-smoking programs
     that will help us meet the goals of reducing youth smoking rates and for a dramatic
     expansion of health-related research to help us cure smoking-related disease. Finally, in
     recognition of the states' role in bringing suit against tobacco companies, the President's
     budget provides for a substantial amount of money to revert to the states. Some of this
     money can be used for any purpose. Other funds must be used on state-administered
     programs to assist children (specifically, for child care, Medicaid child outreach, and
     class size reduction).
