New Initiatives:

After-School program: $100 - 200 million. This $60 million, or 150%, increase over FY 1998 is
part of your Child Care initiative. It builds on 21st Century Schools, for which we obtained first
year funding in FY 1998. The increase means 1,500 new school sites, 2,500 total.

College-School Partnerships: $170 million (ramping up in the outyears). Building on Congo
Fattah's idea, this program will provide continuous mentoring from 6th grade on, to middle and
high school students to encourage them to stay in school and prepare for college.

Education Opportunity Zones: $225 million. (ramping up in the outyears). This initiative will
establish 25-40 Education Opportunity Zones in high"poverty, low achieving rural school
districts which demonstrate a track record of improving student achievement and of
implementing serious standards-based reforms (e.g., ending social promotions, rewarding
effective schools and teachers, turning around failing schools and removing incompetent
teachers). The resources will help the Zone districts strengthen their efforts and becomes models
for other communities throughout the country.

Teacher Recruitment and Preparation: $67 million. Announced last July, this program will help
bring nearly 35,000 outstanding new teachers into high poverty urban and rural schools over the
next five years, and upgrade the quality of teacher preparation programs serving many of the
same communities.
Hispanic Education: $110 million. A package of program increases organized to help Hispanic
students complete high school and to enter and succeed in college.

Technology Teacher Training: $80 million. Adds to your $.6 billion education technology
investments, to ensure that new teachers are trained in the use of the technology:

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 From:          Gene Sperling
                Bruce Reed
                Frank Raines·

 Subject:       Summary of Decisions on the Education Department Budget

       At our December 12th meeting, you accepted the discretionary budget level for Education
 which we presented to you, and asked for a more complete summary of its composition.

 TOTAL. This Budget is a 4.7 %, or $1.4 billion, increase over FY 1998, a total of$30.9 billion.
 It funds important new initiatives, maintains or increases major base programs, and continues
 progress on your previous commitments.

         Substantial as it is, it is half the size of dollar increases Education received each of the
 last two years. Still, it is a large increase given the caps, and we are working on a multi-billion
 dollar school construction program on the mandatory side. Nevertheless, you can expect
 Secretary Riley to make a case for a much bigger discretionary increase.

 New Initiatives:

. After-School program: $100 million. This $60 million, or 150%, increase over FY 1998 is part
  of your Child Care initiative. It builds on 21st Century Schools, for which we obtained first year
  funding in FY 1998. The increase means 1,500 new school sites, 2,500 total.

 College-School Partnerships: $170 million (ramping up in the outyears). Building on Congo
 Fattah's idea, this program will provide continuous mentoring from 6th grade on, to middle and
 high school students to encourage them to stay in school and prepare for college.

 Education Opportunity Zones: $225 million. This initiative, which we hope to link to Congo
 Obey's Comprehensive School Reform grants (see "Base programs" below), will aid
 high-poverty, low achieving urban and rural school districts, if they implement reforms (e.g., end
 social promotion, deal with ineffective teachers) and raise student achievement.

 Hispanic Education: $110 million. A package of program increases organized to help Hispanic
 students complete high school and to enter and succeed in college.

 Technology Teacher Training: $80 million. Adds to your $.6 billion education technology
 investments, to ensure that new teachers are trained in the use of the technology.
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
Base Programs:

 Education testing: $16 million. The full amount needed to maintain progress on test
 development.

  Pell Grants: $7,779 million. A $434 million increase over FY 1998 to maintain higher
. independent student eligibility, and to raise the maximum award from $3,000 to $3,100, the
  highest ever. New cost estimates indicate we may be able to maintain these policies for less. If
  so, we would reinvest the savings in other Education and Training programs.

America Read, $260 million. We did not get our America Reads bill in FY 1998. We did
obtain increases for tutoring in the Corporation for National and Community Service. Congress
did, however, "advance appropriate" $210 million for FY 1999 for Education, contingent upon
enactment of new law. The increase to $260 million reflects our original first year plan.

 Education Technology: $659 million. A $75 million increase over FY 1998 to continue support
 for school investments and development of new software and teaching techniques.

 Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, Grants to LEAs: $ 7,725 million. A $350 million
 increase over FY 1998 to serve an additional 400,000 children in poor communities.

 Goals 2000: $510 million. A $10 million increase over FY 1998, to maintain momentum in the
 States for school reform.

 Comprehensive School Reform: $175 million. A $30 million increase over FY 1998 for
 demonstrations of school reform models. As noted, we hope to gain Congo Obey's support of
 our Education Opportunity Zones by establishing a close linkage between his program and ours.

 Adult Education: $394 million. A $33 million increase over FY 1998 for basic education and
 English language training for the disadvantaged, immigrants, and welfare recipients.

 Special Education: $4,811 million. Same as the FY 1998 level, which was increased by $775
 million over FY 1997. States can spend the increase over 2 years. Secretary Riley will be
 particularly concerned about lack of an FY 1999 increase. We are convinced that no increase
 will satisfy the advocates, and would prefer to negotiate this level in the context of competing
 demands in the appropriation bill, rather than use up scarce funds in your Budget now.

 College Work-Study, $915 million. A $85 million increase over FY 1998, to accelerate toward
 your goal of 1 million Work-Study positions by FY 2000; many support America Reads
 tutoring.

 Reductions in the Base

 A number of programs have been reduced to make room for initiatives and major base programs,
 including: Impact Aid (-$92 million), the Education Block Grant (-$350 million), Perkins Loans
                                                                         "utomated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

    (-$85 million). Each of these, and others, has a vocal constituency. We believe we can make
    the case that our funding of initiatives and base programs are all higher priority than these
    programs.
