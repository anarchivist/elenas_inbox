BR/EK:

Per Bruce's suggestion, I've written a draft directive for our .08
BAC/drunk driving event which is loosely modeled on the safety belt
directive we did in January 1997. The directive basically asks Sec.
Slater to develop a plan to implement .08 BAC on federal lands (it is
anticipated that this would cover national parks and military
installations). While discussions about the proposal have been met with
less than sheer excitement from DOT and much foot dragging (how rare!), I
continue to hold out hope that we could do this for Tuesday.   None of the
WH communications hacks know about this, so if you want to pull the plug,
it shouldn't be a problem. Please let me know if you want to continue to
move forward on the directive, and if so, review the attached draft and
send me edits or comments.

Thanks! !
LS

          MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION

          SUBJECT:       Drunk and Impaired Driving Standards

          We have made progress in improving highway safety during our Administration. Our
          progress has been accomplished through a variety of innovative and aggressive initiatives,
          including our "Buckle Up America" Campaign to vastly increase safety belt usage and
          improve child passenger safety, and the formation of a ground-breaking public-private
          partnership on airbags. We have also taken important steps to reduce the deaths and
          injuries brought about by alcohol use and driving by signing a law to require states to
          adopt "Zero Alcohol Tolerance" laws for youths operating motor vehicles by October 1998.
          To date, 46 states and the District of Columbia have enacted "zero tolerance" laws for youth
          drinking and driving.

          However, drunk driving remains a substantial highway safety problem. Over 40% of all motor
          vehicle deaths in 1996 -- 17,126-- were alcohol-related. More than 2,300 of these fatalities were
          youths. Moreover, alcohol-related crashes cost society $45 billion every year, not including the
          pain and suffering endured by its victims.

           We can do more to prevent the many tragic and unnecessary alcohol-related deaths and
         . injuries which occur on the Nation's roads. That is why my Administration has called on
           Congress to set .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) as the illegal per se limit nationwide. Research
           shows that at a BAC level of .08, drivers are impaired with regard to critical driving tasks, such
           as braking, steering, lane changing, and judgment. The risk of being involved in a crash.
           substantially increases by .08 BAC; the relative risk of being killed in a single vehicle crash at
           .08 BAC has been shown to be II times higher than drivers with no alcohol in their system.

          Despite this elevated risk, 33 states and the District of Columbia have set their illegal impaired
          driving limit at the higher level of .1 0 BAC. It is estimated that if all states lower their limits to
          .08 BAC, we could have 600 fewer alcohol-related traffic deaths every year.

          I hope the Congress will enact this important safety measure as soon as possible. Until the
          Congress acts, however, we should take action to promote .08 BAC as the appropriate standard
          across the country.

          I therefore direct you, working with the appropriate Federal agencies, Congress, the States,
          safety groups and other concerned Americans, to report back to me in 45 days with a plan
          to implement a .08 BAC impaired driving standard on federal lands. [The plan shall
          address, among other things, an education campaign to help the public understand the
          risks associated with alcohol consumption and driving.)
