Dear:

        Thank you for your letter of July 21 regarding the educational needs oflimited English
proficient children in the context of my national standards and testing initiative. I believe
strongly that we must have national standards and tests in the basic skills if we are to provide all
of our students with the world-class education they deserve.

       I know that you have met recently with Secretary of Education Riley to discuss the
recommendations in your letter. As you know, members of my staff and officials of the
Department of Education have been meeting with your staffs and with others in the Hispanic and
education communities who share your concerns.

        Thus, the issues you have raised have been the topic of ongoing discussions within the
Administration. As a result, a number of the recommendations you have made are already being
included in our plans for developing and implementing the national tests, while others are still
under review. My Administration will continue to consult with you as this review proceeds, and
before final decisions are made.

        Let me share with you the steps we are taking in response to your recommendations.

Testing in native languages. The purpose of the 4th grade test is to test student proficiency in
reading in English. I understand your concerns that the testing not be done in a fashion that
excludes limited English proficient students who have not had sufficient time to learn English. I
believe this is an important issue to address, and have asked the Department of Education to
develop recommendations on how this can be done. My Administration will consult with you
before any final determinations are made on this issue.

While this review is underway, it is useful to note that under Title 1 requirements, all students
must be included in the required assessments, and students must be tested in the language that
will best enable them to demonstrate subject matter mastery. Therefore, local school systems
participating in Title 1, including those participating in the national testing initiative, must
include LEP students in assessments, including in assessments of reading comprehension. While
specific testing practices vary from school district to school district, many LEP students are
already being tested in reading comprehension in their native language, and I fully expect this
practice will continue.

Allowing appropriate accommodations. The Education Department and its test development
contractor, in consultation with an advisory committee that is developing test specifications as
well as with other testing and language experts, are developing a set of accommodations for
testing LEP students taking the reading and math tests in English. Accommodations may
include, for example, giving LEP students extra time for completing the test, or making the test
an ''untimed test" in which all students are given the time they need. When the set of
accommodations are finalized, test publishers that market the tests will be required to incorporate
them into test administration procedures.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
Reporting to parents_ I agree that we must make every effort communicate to the parents of
limited English proficient students the purpose and use of the national tests. To a large extent,
the effectiveness of these tests rests on the ability of parents to fully understand the standards
their children are expected to meet, and to use the test results to secure extra help for their
children, where it is needed, and as a catalyst for school improvement. Therefore, the test
results and other appropriate information will be provided to parents in languages they
understand. In addition, the Education Department's Office of Bilingual Education and
Minority Languages Affairs will be working with a group of urban districts which enroll large
numbers ofLEP students to support these districts with strategies and materials to help inform
parents about the purposes of the tests, and to help prepare students to meet the standards.

Monitoring the implementation of the tests. The Education Department will contract with the
National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the implementation of the tests. This evaluation will
include random spot checks to determine the extent to which test administration procedures
(including with regard to the inclusion of students in the testing program and the use of
appropriate accommodations) are being properly implemented.

In addition, my Administration strongly supports the use of school district and school report
cards, which include the disaggregated reporting of test results. Because Title 1 requires that
test results be disaggregated, a growing number of states and local school districts have already
adopted this practice. I fully expect that this trend will continue, and that national test results
will be reported in this fashion. The Education Department will continue to monitor and
encourage this process at the state and local levels. If necessary, it will provide appropriate
assistance to strengthen these trends.

        Secretary Riley and I are committed to working with you, with key local education
leaders, and with others who support raising academic standards in the basic skills for all
students, to continue to find constructive ways of addressing the needs of limited English
proficient students as we proceed with the development and implementation of national tests in
the basic skills.


Sincerely


Bill Clinton
