TEXT:
FYI. Jim O'hara called to say they expect Senator Collins to release a
GAO report Monday on food imports that recommends more resources and
legislative authority for FDA. Those are conclusions that we can say
support our position and O'hara planned to have Mike Friedman comment on
it to that effect.  I'll try and get some q and a together.
