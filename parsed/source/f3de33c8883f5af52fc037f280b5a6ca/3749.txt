TEXT:
We are double checking,but here is part of Section 1085 of the tax bill:

(c) Workfare Payments Not Included in Earned Income.--Section 32(c) (2) (B)
is amended by
striking "and" at the end of clause (iii), by striking the period at the
end of clause (iv) and inserting ",
and", and by adding at the end the following new clause:

"(v) no amount described in subparagraph (A) received for service
performed in work activities as
defined in section 407(d) of the Social Security Act to which the taxpayer
is assigned under any
State program under part A of title IV of such Act, but only to the extent
such amount is subsidized
under such State program.".
