TEXT:
Some, but not all of you heard this yesterday: Judge Hogan ruled
in favor of the government's motion for a 60 day stay in the
timber rider case dealing with the "known to be nesting" criteria
for marbled murrelets.
The stay applies to his decision of last week, that found - in an
opinion which many believe raises strong grounds for a successful
appeal - that Congress could not have meant for the agencies to
rely on the Pacific Seabird Protocol to determine where murre lets
are nesting.
He also indicated that the agencies should go forward in
dtermining which of the sales would be meet the criteria he set
out in his opinion during the stay. We will also use that
information for purposes of appeal, which will be filing shortly
in the 9th Circuit.
On the other hand, he denied our motion for stay on the issue of
whether we have to reoffer sales when the high bidder is no longer
in business or no longer qualifies for the bid.
