TEXT:
Karen says she called DOL at Podesta's request a few days ago to see if
they were comfortable with the notice.  Kitty Higgins asked for one last
chance to talk to Treasury, probably Larry Summers (presumably to talk him
out of it, though I don't know if Summers is familiar with the issue).
That may have happened already.  I'm trying to find out.  I have alerted
Karl Scholz at Treasury.
