Dear Mr. Speaker:

I want to thank you for your recent statements in support of common sense gun legislation and
for your decision to have the House consider these proposals as soon as it returns from the
Memorial Day recess. Although we are disappointed that the House did not take the opportunity
to act on the Senate's juvenile crime bill this week, we appreciate your commitment to consider
similar legislation on an expedited basis.

However, even more important than when you schedule a House vote on these issues is what
proposals you actually bring up for a vote in the House. In the interest of reaching bipartisan
agreement on a comprehensive juvenile crime and gun bill, I would make the following two
suggestions as you begin to draft your legislation:

       1. Look to build on the Senate's legislation by considering additional gun
       proposals.
       The House should view S. 254 as a floor, not a ceiling. Although the bill contains many
       good provisions, it can and should be strengthened by the House. For instance, the bill
       does not raise the age of handgun ownership from 18 to 21, require background checks
       for the purchase of explosives, or. include other such proposals in the President's gun
       legislation (H.R. 1768). You and other Republicans have expressed that these are
       reasonable measures, so we hope you will make every effort to include them in the
       House's legislation.

       2. Do not riddle the bill with dangerous new loopholes. As you know, even as the
       Senate tried to close the gun show loophole, the gun lobby worked behind the scenes to
       include dangerous new loopholes that would have made it easier for criminals to get guns
       and harder for law enforcement to catch those criminals. At one point, the Senate bill
       included at least 5 new loopholes to our gun laws, including one to weaken the successful
       Brady Law by limiting background checks to no more than 24 hours. Make no mistake:
       President Clinton will read all of the fine print and insist -- as he did with the Senate
       --that the House bill not include any ofthe new loopholes proposed by the gun lobby.

Again, Mr. Speaker, thank you for agreeing to take up comprehensive juvenile crime and gun
legislation within the next two weeks. We urge you to not delay any further and quickly pass
legislation to reduce youth violence and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.
