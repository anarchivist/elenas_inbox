Bruce and Elena --

Is it your understanding also that the radio address will be about class
size?

Subject: Radio Address

Ann does not see the need for a meeting or special guests. As of now, the
Radio Address will likely be small class size [vote on Patty Murray's bill
next week?].  But Josh - whoever is writing it should feel free to talk to
Ann about message.
Thanks.
