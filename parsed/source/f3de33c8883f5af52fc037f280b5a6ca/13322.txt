TEXT:
Apparently the POTUS is doing live television interviews into
Seattle (and California cities) tomorrow evening. This could be a
great venue for announcing a timber policy.  In fact, it might be
a little odd if he gives the interviews, says little or nothing on
timber, then we have Glickman and Babbitt say big things on timber
less than 24 hours afterwards. Odd, not intolerable, but
definately a bit out of sync.
WH press wants talking points for the POTUS by 4:00 today. Any
advice?
