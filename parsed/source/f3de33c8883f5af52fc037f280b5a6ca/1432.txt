Attending the immigration meeting Friday at 9:30 will mean I'd have to
miss the 10:00 bifurcation meeting w/HHS et. al. Any suggestions?

Yes, I think we should definitely take part.   It's fine to include OMB and
agencies.

It's a good idea to develop something like that for welfare to work as

with the hill.
