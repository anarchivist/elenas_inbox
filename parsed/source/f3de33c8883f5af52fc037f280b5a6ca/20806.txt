Here is a draft Potus letter to Congress on cloning.  I have included
comments from Rachel Levinson in OSTP, and I sent copy to David Beier for
his comments, which I will pass on when I receive them.  The House is
scheduled to take up the Labor, HHS approps bill on Wed.

I am writing to ask you to work with me to enact into law this year restrictions that will prevent
the cloning of a human being, without disrupting biomedical research. On june 9, 1997, I sent
legislation to the Congress that would achieve these goals. My bill was carefully and narrowly
crafted to prevent the cloning of a human being, but not interfere with important biomedical
research that could lead to meaningful advances in treating illnesses such as cancer and diabetes.
Reports this week of the cloning of more than 50 mice adds to the urgency of our task.

As you know, scientists, the public, and policymakers alike were stunned last year by reports that
a scientist had cloned an adult sheep. Most experts had previously believed that it was not
possible to reprogram the genes of an' adult specialized cell. But as has happened so often,
human ingenuity pierced old assumptions and provided a new understanding of what is possible.
  This technology holds great promise. Many scientists and doctors now believe cloning
technology can be used to produce cell lines that could result in breakthrough treatments for
many dreaded illnesses such as replacing a failing organ without the need for a donor or the risk
of tissue rejection.

But the new technology also poses difficult moral questions. Scientific advancement should not
occur in a moral vacuum. Technological developments divorced from values will not bring us
one step closer to meeting the challenges of the next millennium. Virtually everyone agrees that
the use of new cloning techniques to create a human being is untested, unsafe, and morally
unacceptable.

This week's reports on the advances in cloning technology make it important that we set aside
politics and send a clear message that cloning a child is not an acceptable endeavor. I am
concerned that efforts to address other moral questions, such as when does human life begin, in
cloning legislation are endangering our chances of passing a bill this year. We have the
opportunity to pass cloning legislation in the next two months. But we will only succeed if we
stay focused on prohibiting the cloning of human beings, and not try to resolve other moral
conundrums.
