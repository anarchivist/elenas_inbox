TEXT:
1. How did we come up with the $18.9 figure for 2001-2004 -- does it
represent 57% of something?

2. Joe was asked specifically today about Governor Gray Davis's comments
that California is not getting reimbursed at all for Medicaid costs
because they took Medicaid out of their suit.  What's the answer to that?
(I might want to post an answer to this one in the back of the press room.)

3. We are only trying to direct states how to spend the $18.9 plus future
years of our share, not their share as well, correct?
