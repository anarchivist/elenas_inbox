                               A Good Start for Welfare Reform

                                         by Bruce Reed

                                                                                    8/18/97
                                                                                    850 words


        Nothing in the Clinton Presidency has prompted as much socially conscious hand
wringing as the new welfare law the President signed a year ago this week. Three
Administration staffers resigned in protest; one sold the Atlantic Monthly a dire cover story on
"The Worst Thing Bill Clinton Has Done." Whoopi Goldberg told Playboy that children would
suffer. David Broder wrote that giving the Present a second term to restore the bill's cuts in
inunigrant benefits was like giving Jack the Ripper a scholarship to medical school.

        A year later, welfare recipients are faring a lot better under the new law than welfare
refonn critics. A strong economy and aggressive state effort~ to move people from welfare to
work have helped produce a record drop in welfare caseloads. The percentage of Americans on
welfare is the smallest since 1970. This month, the President signed a balanced budget law that
restores $11.5 billion in inunigrant benefits, as promised.

        The conventional wisdom in elite circles has long been that signing the welfare bill was a
cynical, heartless, poll-driven decision. The new law's early success suggests another
possibility: that the President did the right thing, for the right reason.

        When he signed the welfare law, President Clinton made two predictions that almost no
one believed at the time. First, he said the inunigrant benefits could be paid for with smaller tax
cuts. Asked how he could get that through a Republican Congress, the President said, "It all
depends on your priorities." A year later, that's exactly what happened: the President
threatened to veto the entire budget agreement if it didn't do right by inunigrants, and the same
Republicans who had imposed the cuts found the money to fix them -- helping 350,000 elderly
and disabled inunigrants to be treated fairly.

        Before the budget agreement, reasonable people could disagree about whether the good in
the welfare bill outweighed the harm of the inunigrant cuts. Not any more. The new budget
also provides work slots so hundreds of thousands of childless adults can now keep their food
stamps, tax credits for businesses that hire people off welfare, and $3 billion to make sure
long-tenn welfare recipients in depressed areas have jobs to go to.

        The President's other prediction last August, also widely dismissed at the time, was that
states and recipients alike might actually be up to the responsibilities the new law demands.
Critics said that breaking the 61-year-old federal entitlement and turning welfare over to the
states would produce a "race to the bottom," with every state rushing to throw poor people into
the streets.
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
       It turns out that not every state wants to be Mississippi. No longer able to blame
Washington for failure, states are competing to show who can do the best job of moving people
from welfare to work. Child care spending is up everywhere, in many states by even more than
the new law requires. Illinois increased its child care budget by 96%. Last week, California
Govemor Pete Wilson signed a bipartisan welfare plan that increases overall welfare spending by
$223 million in the first year, and budgets $1.8 billion a year for child care and work programs.

        In fact, the new law is actually helping states be more generous. Critics had warned that
states would have to cut back because they now get a fixed block grant instead of uncapped
federal spending that goes up or down with caseload size. Instead, the block grant has proved to
be a boon for states and recipients alike. Because the block grant was based on higher caseload
levels, states are receiving about 25% more from the federal government than they would under
the old law. That's at least $3 billion a year more that states can spend on moving people from
welfare to work -- considerably more than we proposed in the President's original 1994 bill,
which Republicans attacked as a budget buster.

        But the most impressive rebuttal to last year's jeremiads has come from recipients
themselves, who are taking responsibility at a remarkable pace. Prior to the Clinton
Administration, the welfare caseload had dropped by more than 250,000 only twice in six
decades. Today welfare caseloads, which fell by a record 1.9 million in the President's first 3 Y,
years in office, are on course to have dropped by 2 million more in the year since he signed the
law.

          The challenge of welfare refonn is far from over. Making the leap from welfare to work
is still an enonnous personal struggle for everyone who goes through it. We need to do
everything we can -- from providing hiring subsidies to making child care and transportation
more affordable -- to help more businesses give people that chance and more recipients to take it.
 We also need to keep an eye on states to make sure they plow any savings from their success
right back into putting even more people to work.

       But on two points, the first year of this bold experiment leaves little room for debate: The
old welfare system based on income maintenance was a dismal failure -- and the new system
based on work and responsibility is off to a very good start.
