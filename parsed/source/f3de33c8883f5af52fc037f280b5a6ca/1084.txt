 TEXT:
 HHS provided me with a copy of an announcement that has apparently been
 distributed at the University of Florida by the Asst. Director of the
 International Student Center which is filled with inaccuracies about the
 welfare bill and legal immigrants and temporary visa hqlders.   It says,
 e.g., that if you take part in a "public funded program" from now on you
 are deportable.  Someone down there has apparently told parents who are
 international students that they need to pull their kids out of the
 University's child care or they will be subject to deportation.

 HHS is working with DOJ/INS to clear up exactly what the facts are down
 there and either last night or this morning a contact will be made with
 the appropriate person at the University to get this cleared up.  I will
 keep you posted.

 Thanks
