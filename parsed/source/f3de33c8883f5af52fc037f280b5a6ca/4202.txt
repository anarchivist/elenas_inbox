Subject:         After School

Rahm & Jose - I faxed each of you an advance copy of a report being
presented to the AG by "Fight CJ::ime Invest in Kids" at' a juvie event in
Rockville, MD tomorrow.  On page 3 of the report, there is a chart which
shows that 41.8% of juvenile crime occurs between 3 & 8 PM. This is based
on data from 8 states.  In the past, both the President & AG have cited
the statistic of 50% between 3 & 6 PM. The 50% # is based on only 1
state. While we don't think there is an immediate problem, if we are
called on the matter, the answer is simply that we had data from 1 state
indicating 50%. Now, we have 7 more states and the more refined # is
41.8%. That's still a lot.
