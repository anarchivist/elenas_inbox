TEXT:
Per Christa's e-mail:

Gil Gallegos has requested a meeting with Erskine when he is in town on
March 23;
I talked to Rahm and he believes that we should do this meeting; he is
more than happy to talk to Erskine about it as well. Please let me know if
there is any reason Rahm should be aware of why we should not do this
meeting. [Carole-anytime on the 23rd that works for Erskine, Rahm has said
he will do.]
