TEXT:
You may have already taken care of this, but I am concerned that Sec'y
Shalala didn't have a representative at today's food safety mtg. As you
know, Shalala has held the strongest views about the food safety
organizational chart. Although FDA was at the meeting, HHS and FDA have
not always been in synch on how food safety should be organized.  I don't
think FDA would take a different position than HHS, but I do think FDA is
probably not as sensitive to Shalala's concerns -- particularly the Hill
politics. Someone was probably invited.   But you may want to call her
office so that they don't hear about today's discussions second hand.
