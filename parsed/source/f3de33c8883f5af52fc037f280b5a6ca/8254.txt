Dear:

        As you know, there have been some recent tragedies across the country that involve hate
crimes. Last week a man in Jasper, Texas, was dragged behind a pickup truck, dismembered
and killed. While this tragic event serves to focus America's attention on the problem, every
week scores of our fellow citizens are subjected to violence on account of their race, color,
national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability.

        In America we hear too many stories like the 13-year-old African American boy nearly
beaten to death when he rode his bicycle through the wrong neighborhood, the gay American
murdered as he walked home from work, the Asian American who lost her store to a firebomb
hurled by a racist, the Jewish American whose house of worship was desecrated by swastikas.

        We hear too many of these stories -- stories of violent acts which are not just despicable
acts of bias and bigotry, they are crimes. They strike at the heart of what it means to be an
American. They are the antithesis of the values that define us as a nation. They have nothing to
do with freedom or equality or respect for differences of opinion, and most importantly, they
prevent us from respecting one another. I believe -- and I hope you will agree -- that now is
the time for us to unite as Americans and take strong and decisive action to fight these hate
crimes and to stop intolerance.

         I am thus writing you today to restate my deeply-held belief that the Congress must act
quickly this year to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998. This crucial legislation
would expand the ability of the Justice Department to prosecute hate crimes by removing
needless jurisdictional requirements for existing crimes and by giving federal prosecutors for the
first time the power to prosecute hate crimes committed on account of a bias against a person's
sexual orientation, gender or disability.

        There is no problem more important to the future of this country than attacking the
divisive issue of intolerance, prejudice and violent bigotry. This legislation will lead the
way in making sure people form all walks of life feel more safe and secure in our country,
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

whatever their race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or
disability. I implore you to move this vital piece of legislation without delay.


                                    Sincerely,
