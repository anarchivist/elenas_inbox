       TEXT:
       Attached is the concept paper that Andrea and I worked on reo the
       ESL/Civics initiative.  We are still looking at some of the details, but
       wanted to get your input, etc. The one more substantive question is
       whether we want to set aside some portion of the money for a state-only
       competition, and leave the rest for a competition open to CBOs, churches,
       etc. Education has argued that the state-only set-aside helps
       institutionalize the effort and promotes states' leveraging existing
       literacy block grant funds.  The down side is, perhaps, less of a
       community based focus and less money used for direct services (though we
       could, i suppose, build in a requirement that the funds be used in a way'
       that is community-based and that the bulk of the grant must be used for
       services) .

       We are also not sure how much detail on this part of the initiative we
       would want to release with the budget or whether this initiative will be
       part of the SOTU. NEC has indicated that they would like to do a larger
       literacy event, of which this would be a part.  We are following up with
       them to determine if this is for real.

                              ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND CIVICS EDUCATION

         Purpose

         Many people who are new to America need more than just our welcome: in order to succeed and
         become full participants in American life, they need to be able to speak and read in English and
         they need to understand how our American system works -- in the areas of school, work, and
         community life. The evidence from within immigrant communities demonstrates high levels of
         enthusiasm for learning English and participating in civic life; however, the demand for
         instruction in these areas far outweighs the current supply.

         Our goal is to help states and communities provide expanded access to high quality English
         language proficiency instruction, linked to practical instruction in civics, history, and life skills
         including how to navigate the banking system, the public education system, and/or the
         workplace. This initiative is designed both to help meet the extraordinary demand for English
         and civics instruction in immigrant communities as well as to demonstrate the commitment of
         both immigrants and the larger American society toward full integration of new Americans into
         our social and civic life.

         Rationale

         ·      There is an increased demand for English language instruction in immigrant
                communities. English language instruction is the fastest growing component in adult
                education -- enrollment in ESL has increased 72% over the past ten years. Also, many of
                the more effective ESL programs teach English is in combination with more practical
                skill building, such as how to navigate school, work, public services, etc.

         ·      The link to civic education promotes "One America" goals -- assisting new immigrants to
                become full participants in American life.

         ·      Because each community has different needs and different populations of immigrants, we
                should encourage communities to develop English language / civic education projects
                tailored to their specific needs and. populations.

         Eligible Grantees

         States will compete for $30 million in grants to support ESLIcivics instruction on a state-wide
         basis. These grants would range in value from $3 - $5 million. States could then effectively
         leverage their own ESL funds in support ofthis initiative. States would be required to provide a
         match of at least 25% (consistent with the basic grant)

         Community-based organizations, local education agencies, tribally-controlled schools,
         institutions of higher education (including community colleges), public libraries, and other
         non-profits (such as unions, churches, and schools) would compete for $40 million in funds.
         The non-state grants would range in value from $150,000 to $1.5 million.

           Total Funding Level

           The initiative would be funded at $70 million for FY 2000 -- $30 million for the state
           competition; $40 million for the competition that includes community-based organization, etc ..

           How does it work?

           The competitive grant project would be run out ofthe Department of Education's Office of
           Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE).

           Grants can be used for varied purposes related to the program including English language/civics
           instruction, staff materials, personnel training, and support services including child care and
           transportation costs for program participants (if not otherwise available).

           We would require a strong accountability component: grant recipients will report semi-annually
           to the Secretary of Education.

           Who can we serve?

           With $70 million, the initiative will be able to provide ESLIcivics instruction (for 8-16 weeks) to
           approximately 150,000 people. (need to confirm whether there are restrictions on serving
           only legal immigrants).

           Grant application requirements:

           (1) English language education should be linked to instruction on the rights and responsibilities
           of citizenship (including civics and U.S. history); the rights and responsibilities associated with
           being residents in their communities; and/or navigating various parts of American life, including
           how to use the banking system, accessing employment and improving work skills, navigating the
           public school system, using the public transportation system, accessing child care, dealing with
           housing issues, voting, paying taxes, etc. Each program should provide a contextualized basis
           for the language instruction itself.

           (2) Proposals should identify how the applicant plans to determine the impact of their program;
           we will expect applicants to have quality controls to assess the impact of their work. State
           applicants will need to demonstrate a clear need for increased funds for ESL services in their
           state.

           (3) Applicants should consider ways to effectively link with state or local educational
           institutions.

           (4) Proposals should recognize the unique needs of this popUlation by incorporating flexible and
           non-traditional approaches, such as evening and week-end hours, technology as a tool to expand
           access, and workplace and/or community-based sites, etc.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Convorsiun

(5) Encourage the use of volunteers, including Americorps and VISTA volunteers, mentors from
the students ~ country of origin, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Corps.

(6) Encourage partnerships with employers and/or employer groups to help improve the
employment and life skills of their workforce.

(7) Encourage strong links with existing programs at the state, local, and community level,
including education, employment, refugee resettlement, housing, and transportation programs.

 (8) Must demonstrate significant unmet need for these services ..

 Current Initiatives

  The Department of Education currently funds a $361 million Adult Education basic grant
  program. Under this program, the states decide how much of their Adult Education money to
  devote to ESL. Last year, 46% of these dollars ($166 million) went to ESL programs
. administered by states. However, in many areas there are long waiting lists.

In FY 99, the Department of Education received $7 million for ESL demonstration programs.
They have not yet decided precisely what to do with it. Some ofthis money could be used to
provide research and evaluation of the various programs funded under this initiative.

 For the last five years, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee
 Resettlement (ORR) has operated the Community and Family Strengthening Program which
 addresses the needs of refugees becoming part of the community as well as the community
 learning about refugees. These projects are designed by the communities to respond to the
 priorities they determine. However, only about 10% of new immigrants are refugees, so these
 programs do not reach the vast majority of immigrants.
