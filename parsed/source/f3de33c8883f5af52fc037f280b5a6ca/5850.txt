TEXT:
Elena,

According to John Morton from the DAG's office, the AG has agreed to
proceed with the administrative procedure for Central Americans, pending
Holder's final recommendation. Morton is meeting with Holder tomorrow
afternoon to get his final approval.  The last time that we spoke to Maria
about this (at the meeting that we all had a couple of weeks ago), she was
also comfortable with proceeding in this way (rather than by a regulation
that would alter the standard for "extreme hardship").  Also, OLC has told
the DAG's office that the administrative procedure would be lawful.  As
soon as Morton gets final DOJ approval, he will call us and he and OPL can
then contact the advocates to let them know what we are doing.  Earlier,
we all agreed that Justice would take the lead on this implementation once
these decisions were made.

Julie
