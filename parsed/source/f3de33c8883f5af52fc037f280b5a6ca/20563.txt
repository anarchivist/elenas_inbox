TEXT:
I talked to Leahy's staff and we need to update the EBB letter on child
custody to take the tone up a notch since Abraham put out a substitute
that does not address any of our concerns but picks up changes made by
House Republicans. The markup is in Senate Judiciary on Thursday and we
won't have the votes to make any improvements.  Bill and I talked about a
new draft which he is working on. We need it to committee by wed.
