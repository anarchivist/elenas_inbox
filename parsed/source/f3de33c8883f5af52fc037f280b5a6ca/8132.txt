      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

      ROBERTSON COULD BE HELD LIABLE SHOULD A TERRORIST
      BOMB MANIFEST IN ORLANDO, HRC ASSERTS

      Washington, D.C. -- The Human Rights Campaign warned religous political
      broadcaster Pat Robertson that his remarks made earlier this week about
      Orlando,
      Fl., expose him and his media empire to civil and criminal charges should
      the
      city experience a terrorist attack. Robertson said that Orlando could
      suffer
      from terrorist bombs, hurricanes, earthquakes and even a meteor for
      allowing· gay
      pride flags to be flown along city streets. His remarks were made Monday
      on the
      Christian Broadcasting Network's "700 Club" following a news report on "Gay
      Days" at Walt Disney World, which took place Saturday, June 6.

          "Pat Robertson practically invited a terrorist attack on the city of
     Orlando." said David M. Smith, HRC's communications director and senior
     strategist. "In the wake of last year's bombings at Olympic Park, the
     Atlanta
     gay nightclub, and a number of attacks on women's reproductive health care
     facilities, his remarks are an outrageous act of irresponsibility that
     have the
     potential to incite more violence."

           "I would warn Orlando that you're right in the way of some serious
     hurricanes and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in God's face if I
     were
     you," Robertson said. "This is not, a message of hate; this is a message of
     redemption. But a condition like this will bring about the destruction of
     your
     nation. It'll bring about terrorist bombs; i t ' l l bring earthquakes,
     tornadoes
     and possibly a meteor."

          "Pat Robertson has exposed himself and the Christian Broadcasting
     Network
     to significant legal action should such a terrorist attack take place,"
     said
     Tony Varona, HRC's chief counsel. "These remarks clearly indicate a
     reckless
     disregard for the safety and well-being of the people of Orlando."

           Despite these irresponsible remarks,three days later Pat Robertson
     was
     grant.ed a meeting with House Republican leadership to discuss issues of
     concern
     to the Christian Coaltion, the religious political organization he founded.
     Robertson and Christian Coalition Executive Director Randy Tate met with
     House
     Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas
     late
     Wednesday according to news reports.

          The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
     political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively


 lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
 ensure
 that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at home, at
 work,
 and in the community.
