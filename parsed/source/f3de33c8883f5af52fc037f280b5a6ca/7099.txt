TEXT:
MN will probably introduce the first of the 39K documents in its trial
tomorrow.   If the state does, it will be while a defense witness is on the
stand -- Scott Appleton, a scientific director at B&W. MN predicts there
is a SO/50 chance tomorrow's document{s) will make news.   MN does expect
to make news soon on the documents.   Several news outlets are eager to do
stories· and it is likely more explosive documents will be introduced
either this week or in the next few weeks.

Here is a recap on state efforts to make the documents public: MN
believes it can make the documents public prior to introducing the
documents into evidence based on a prior order by the judge.    The tobacco
industry has a motion pending before the judge to block prior release.     MN
believes it will prevail on the industry motion, but has decided the
better course is not to release any documents based on the judge's
previous order and wait for his ruling on the current industry motion.    MN
expects the judge will rule soon.     MN will fax us the documents as they
are made public.                    .
