I've updated to reflect House Approps committee action. Paul--they made no
change to subcommittee mark on the WTW vouchers. Haven't gotten any more
detailed info than that yet.

Weekly Report -- Welfare Reform Team
6/25/98

        HousinglWelfare Reform -- Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers and Individual
Development Accounts (IDA): The House Appropriations Committee voted last week to
include $100 million in the VAlHUD appropriations bill for 17,700 welfare-to-work housing
vouchers. While this is only one-third of our request, it is more than double the Senate
committee It:vel of$40 million for 7,000 vouchers and it represents significant progress for this
new Administration initiative. The House language regarding how the funds would be
distributed and used is virtually identical to our proposal, whereas the Senate has a narrower
demonstration program. We are continuing to push for our full request.

         The CoatslHarkin IDA demonstration program that you recently decided to support, was
included in the Human Services Reauthorization bill passed out of the Senate committee last
week with strong bipartisan support. The bill authorizes $100 million over four years to provide
matching funds for low income individuals who save to buy a home, pursue higher education, or
start a small business. It is not clear whether the House will include a similar program in its
Human Services Reauthorization bill to be marked up after the recess. We are exploring an
appropriate time and place to announce your support for the IDA program.
The House Appropriations Committee is expected to vote today to include $100 million in the
VAlHUD appropriations bill for 17,700 welfare-to-work housing vouchers [will update as soon
as we know what happens]. While this is only one-third of our request, it is more than double
the Senate committee level of $40 million for 7,000 vouchers and it represents significant
progress. The House language regarding how the funds would be distributed and used is
virtually identical to our proposal, whereas the Senate has a narrower demonstration program.
Weare continuing to push for our full request. .

and it is not clear whether the House will include a similar program in its Human Services
