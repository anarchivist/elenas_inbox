TEXT:
Teacher Policy Speech. We are working on a new series of teacher policy
initiatives for the FY 2000 budget, to complement our class size reduction
proposal and which would go beyond past Administration initiatives to
recruit and prepare new teachers. The President could use these as the
basis for a major speech on teacher policy, which would focus on a
comprehensive set of steps that must be taken to attract and recruit the
best possible candidates into teaching, prepare them will, support and
hold them to the highest standards, reward those who succeed and remove
those who don't belong in the classroom.  While the speciific policy
initiatives are still under development, the speech itself would include a
series of challenges to states, school districts, institutions of higher e
ducation and teachers themselves, as well as new Administration
initiatives. The Education Department is in the early stages of planning
a conference on teacher quality; depending on timing this speech could be
the feature part of that conference or could be given at some other venue.
