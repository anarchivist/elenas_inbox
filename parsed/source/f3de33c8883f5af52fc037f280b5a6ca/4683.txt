     The House of Representatives will soon vote on
accepting the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1122,
legislation that will ban all late-term abortions.
 As you know, I have long opposed late-term abortions,
and I continue to do so except in those instances
necessary to save the life of a woman or prevent
serious harm to her health. Unfortunately, neither
H.R. 1122, nor the Senate Amendment which will be
pending before the House, contains an exception to
the measure's ban on late-term abortions that will
adequately protect the lives and health of the small
group of women in tragic circumstances who need an
abortion performed at a late stage of pregnancy.
Consequently, I urge you to vote against H.R. 1122
when it comes before the House. Moreoever, should        ~      »

a bipartisan manner to fashion legislation that
recognizes that there are cases where this procedure
should be allowed when the health risks facing a woman
are deadly serious and real. To abandon the women
issue can be resolved, enactment of H.R. 1122 is not
the answer. I urge you to vote against this measure.
