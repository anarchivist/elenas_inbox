    TEXT:
    This is quite a pop quiz!     Here are the answers.   I'm faxing to Laura the
    tables mentioned.

    1.  How many people are now on the rolls?
            Just under 11 million (10,969,000 in April 1997, the latest month
    for which we have data)
            We have a table we could fax her.

    2.   What percentage is that of the population?

         According to HHS data, 4.1% of the u.S. population was on welfare
 in April 1997 --
         11 million people out of a total u.S. population of. 267 million.
 That's the lowest percentage of the population on welfare since 1970.    (In
 1970, the comparable figures were 8.5 million people on welfare out of a
·total u.S. population of 205 million.)

               We have a table and a bar graph on this one.

    3. When we say that Wisconsin [you must have meant Florida] has put 23m
    and wisconsin 160m in new funds into child care, is that this year?

         I have Joan Lombardi tracking down the answer to this question and
 making sure these numbers are correct.  I've dropped the numbers from the
 speech because of the uncertainty.  However, for Wisconsin, the numbers
 are: investing a total of $158 million this year (however, not all is new
 as we first thought).  Florida had earlier told HHS that it was $23 in new
'funds this year, but it is still being verified (sorry).

    4.   What are examples of states that have seamless child care systems?

               Illinois, Michigan, Washington

    5. What was the rate of child support collection in 1992? now (or in
    1996)? Can we get state-by-state breakdowns on child support?

               1992 - $7.9 billion was collected nationwide.
               1996 - $11,9 billion was collected nationwide.
               Increase from 1992-1996 is 49%


        Yes I have state by state.

6. Have any states actually diverted funds?   If I want to name a "bad"
state   and say why -- which should it be?

        Diverting welfare savings for other uses has been discussed in many
States. We happen to have detailed information from the Center for Public
policy Priorities (CPPP) in Austin, Texas, an organization that monitors
budgeting decisions in the State legislature. CPPP found that Texas will
have a $363 million TANF "surplus" due to declining caseloads. Of this
surplus, Texas used only $126 or about one-third on services for welfare
recipients; the state used most of the rest of the federal funds to
replace existing state spending or fill budget gaps in other areas.  The
contact person at the Center is Patrick Bresette at 512/320-0222.

7. Are there any interesting graphics -- a map, a chart, etc. -- we can,
should offer?

Yes, we have two graphs -- one showing caseloads over time, the other
(which is even more dramatic) which shows the percent of population on
welfare.

8.  What's the year (1994??) that TANF funds are pegged to?
        Newspaper stories commonly say 1995 or 1994; the truth is states
get to chose the most advantageous of these three: 1) average of 1992,
1993, and1994; 2) 1994; 3) 1995 (with some tweaking -- i.e., its actually
4/3 of the first three quarters of 1995, since full year data weren't
available when the law was passed).

Many, many thanks.
