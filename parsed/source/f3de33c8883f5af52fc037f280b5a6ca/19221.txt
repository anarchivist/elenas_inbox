TEXT:
At noon today the US Conference of Mayors confirmed that May 7 at 2pm will
work for them to come to the WH to conclude their Mayors Conference on
Public Schools. We indicated the meeting with the President would be
followed by a reception.

I will serve as the IGA staff contact for this event along with Lynn
Cutler. Mike Cohen is the lead for DPC.  Let's plan on getting together
next week to detemine how best to procede with planning internally and
with the USCM. Thanks.
