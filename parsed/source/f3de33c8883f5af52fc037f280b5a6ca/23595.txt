TEXT:
EPA has had ready for a while a series of public service announcements
which encourage parents who smoke to do so outside, away from their kids
-- a good public health message, but not one that ever seemed right to
combine with any of our other tobacco announcements (didn't fit Kick
Butts, for example) .  At this point I'm inclined to have EPA go ahead and
do these. What do you think?

P.S. I'm hopelessly overdue in getting back to Gary Guzy at EPA about
this.  Elena if he calls you that is probably why. Hopefully I can handle
this so you don't have to.
