TEXT:
Congresswoman Water's office called to let me know that the Budget Message
Document, "President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and the Congressional
Democrats Win on the Budget, But There Is Still More Work To Do,"    does
not indicate or reflect the Black Farmers win in the bill for the CBC nor
does it reflect that the AIDS package for minorities was a CBC priority
targeted for African Americans.   Donna Cruise indicated that the
Congresswoman and other CBC members felt strongly that since there is a
reference to the Hispanic Education Initiative there should be some
similar reference to accomplishments targeted for African Americans.
Can we update our current document or will there be an effort to do
summary sheets for different wins in the bill targeted to different
groups? I thought I saw a draft document targeted for women.   Should we


do something similar for African Americans and Hispanics?   please advise.
JM
