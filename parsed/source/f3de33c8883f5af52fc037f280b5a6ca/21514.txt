TEXT:
I spoke with Phil Caplan and he does not think the President will be able
to look at pre-briefing materials tonight, so we should submit the final
briefing materials to the President by noon tomorrow so that he can review
them during phone and office time.  This means that by COB today Laura
Emmett should be emailed all DPC briefing documents so that Elena can edit
them tomorrow morning.
DPC Documents:
- Overall two-pager on announcements at the Conference (Jose)
  Fact Sheet: Reauthorizing Safe and Drug Free Schools (Tanya)
- Fact Sheet: Community-wide Solutions (Neera)
- Fact Sheet: COPS Funding and School Uniforms (Leanne)
- Fact Sheet: Federal Response to Violent Deaths (Leanne)
  Script for President's Panel   (Christa)
  Briefing Memo (Christa).

Richard is assembling other briefing materials including the agenda,
audience list, etc ... Richard, let's plan on having the final briefing
materials by II:OOish and we can assemble them, plus a copy of both the
Annual Report and the Mayor's Action plan for the book. Does that sound
okay to you?

please let me know if I left anything out. Thanks.
