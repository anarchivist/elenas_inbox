TEXT:
You should have received Mary Bourdette's redraft of the OMB passback on
the Golden testimony. Are you ok with her rewrite? Also, do you plan to
give me an insert on the two provisions in the Shaw bill that would
potentially weaken the P.L. 104-193 work requirement?

Please give me a call at 5-3923 to discuss. We cannot give HHS the go
ahead to transmit its testimony without your signoff.
