You asked whether there are protections in the welfare law to prevent worker displacement.
The law expressly forbids federally-subsidized welfare reform programs from placing welfare
recipients in job openings created by company layoffs, terminations, or involuntary reductions of
the workforce (section 407(f) of the law). Welfare recipients can, however, be placed in jobs
that are vacant for reasons other than firings or layoffs (openings created, for example, by
attrition or the cancellation of a vendor contract). Moreover, while states must have a
grievance procedure for resolving complaints of alleged displacement, the law does not require
specific procedures or proscribe penalties for state violations, leading some to argue that the
prohibition against displacement is unenforceable.

 Thus, the April 23rd USA Today editorial was correct in saying, "The law bars employer from
firing existing workers to hire welfare recipients whose compensation is subsidized by the state.
But its intent can be defeated by reducing hours, wages or benefits for existing workers or
terminating outside contracts; workfare recipients can then fill vacancies."

During Senate consideration of the welfare legislation, Senator Rockefeller, with some help from
Republicans like Senator D' Amato, fought unsuccessfully to strengthen this provision.


                          Weekly Item on Welfare to Work Partnership

We have made plans with Eli Segal for a May 20th White House event to launch the Welfare to
Work Partnership, which was formed by the five CEOs you praised in the State of the Union.
You will announce that 25 or more additional companies have accepted your challenge to hire
welfare recipients. We also plan to have you announce your commitment to ensure that funds
are available for innovative transportation efforts to ensure that welfare recipients can get to
work. You would announce pilot grants to 25 states to develop welfare to work transportation
plans and promote your proposal to provide $600 million in welfare to work funds (part of your
NEXTEA transportation bill). We may be able to also announce that some ofthe companies
present would commit to providing matching funds for such welfare-to-work transportation
efforts.
