MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
FROM:           ??
SUBJECT:                TEAM ACT LETTER TO CEOS

Attached is a draft veto statement for the TEAM Act. The
statement rearticulates the message in the Statement of
Administration Policy on the bill:  1) the Administration
strongly supports labor
o
-management partnerships; 2) labor
management partnerships are flourishing under current law; 3) the
TEAM Act wouldn't increase or strengthen these partnerships but
instead would undermine the collective bargaining system.  It
also points out that the NLRB will independently continue to


clarify the law in this area.  It does not endorse any
legislation to change current law.
Pros:
?       Makes a strong statement in favor of labor
o
-management
partnerships and your consistent support of them.
?       will be consistent with the promise the Vice President made
in his Bal Harbour appearance before the AFL
o
-CIO in 1995
?        will not cause unintended consequences in the Congress.
Constituents who are most concerned about the TEAM Act fear
that if you make a positive statement about changes to
?8(a) (2) of the National Labor Relations Act, you will
generate renewed interest in finding a legislative
compromise that you could sign. They point out that the
alternative Democratic bills have not generated any media
stories suggesting that Democrats want to amend ?8(a) (2).
But they fear that presidential support for changes to
?8(a) (2) is a different matter and will create momentum that
will lead to actual changes in the law.   They believe that
any changes to ?8(a) (2) risk making it more difficult for
employees to organize new workplaces; and so they believe
any such changes are tantamount to an assault on the right
of employees to organize unions.

?       Maintains a balanced approach to labor policy. While the
NLRB estimates that an average of three businesses per year
are ordered to disband labor
o
-management committees due to
violations of 8(a) (2), it estimates that XX thousand
businesses are found guilty each year of illegally firing
employees because they support unions.   It would appear
unbalanced to address the business community's concerns
without also addressing related employee/union concerns
which also undermine cooperation in the workplace.
?       Will not generate criticism from the labor movement.   The
AFL
o
-CIO views this issue a threat to employees' ability to
organize -- the very essence of the labor movement. Their
sentiments on this issue are even more intense than their
sentiments about NAFTA.
Cons:
?       If this issue takes on a larger symbolic prominence in the
public debate, we will be hard pressed to explain why you
are not supporting an alternative bill supported by 202
Democratic House Members and 37 (check) Democratic Senators.
?       Some in the business community argue clarification is needed
and this letter addresses that concern merely by noting the
NLRB's ability to clarify the law.
?       Could be viewed as giving in to labor constituents' demands.

Alternative
The attached statement could also be amended to include a
paragraph stating that to the extent some employers are reluctant
to use labor
o


-management cooperation efforts due to confusion
about the law, you would welcome reasonable clarifications to the
law, along the lines of the Democratic bill in the Senate. The
advantage of this approach is it addresses the problems outlined
in the "cons" section above, enabling you to state that you, like
the many Democrats who voted for the bill, are in favor of
legislative changes that facilitate labor
o
-management
partnerships.  The disadvantage of this approach is that it
negates all but the first "pro" outlined above, potentially
leading to unintended congressional results and definitely
leading to harsh criticism from supporters.

Options


          Statement as drafted          Alternative
          Let's discuss
o
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
        I am returning herewith without my approval, H.R. 743, the
Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act, commonly known as the
TEAM Act. This act would undermine crucial employee protections.
        I strongly support workplace practices that promote
cooperative labor
o
-management relations.   In order for the United
States to remain globally competitive into the next century,
employees must recognize their stake in their employer's
business, employers must value their employees' labor, and each
must work in partnership with the other. Cooperative efforts, by
promoting mutual trust and respect, can encourage innovation,
improve productivity, and enhance the efficiency and performance
of American workplaces.
        Current law leaves room for a wide variety of cooperative
workplace efforts. As articulated in recent decisions of the
National Labor Relations Board, current law permits employers to
work with employees in quality circles to improve quality,
efficiency and productivity. Current law allows employers to
delegate significant managerial responsibilities to employee work
teams, sponsor brainstorming sessions, and solicit employee
suggestions and criticisms. Today, 30,000 workplaces across the
country have employee involvement plans. According to one recent
survey, 96% of large employers already have established such
programs.
        I strongly support encouraging further labor
o
-management
cooperation within the broad parameters allowed under current
law. As case law and workplace practices evolve, the NLRB will
exercise its independent authority to provide guidance and
clarify the legal boundaries of labor
o
-management teamwork.
        The TEAM Act, however, would not increase genuine teamwork
and would undermine the system of collective bargaining that has
served this country so well for many decades.  The TEAM Act would
allow employers to establish company unions where no union
currently exists and would permit company


     o
     -dominated unions where
     employees are in the process of determining whether to be
     represented by a union.  Rather than encouraging true workplace
     cooperation, the TEAM Act would abolish protections that ensure
     independent and democratic representation in the workplace.
             True cooperative efforts must be based on true partnerships.
     A context of mutual trust and respect encourages the prospect for
     achieving workplace innovation, improved productivity,  and
     enhanced efficiency and workplace performance.
