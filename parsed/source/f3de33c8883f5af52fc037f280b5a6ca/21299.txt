TEXT:
Elena asked me to attend this event meeting in Maria's office regarding
the Thursday event. The plan is to have the President appear flanked by
his economic advisers and make a short speech about the new income /
poverty numbers (about 11:10)   Besides the usual
why-my-economic-policies-have- been-good-for-Arnerica, the speech will
mention why it's important we have an accurate Census (these are Census
numbers although not ones that would be affected by sampling) and why we
must be fiscally responsible and save Social Security first (this is the
day of the House Social Security/taxes vote).   There will probably be a
Yellen/Sperling briefirig afterward. Orszag and Siewart are the leads but
we'll keep our eyes on it too.

Andrea and others are getting the briefing now on the details of the
numbers, but NEC had gotten pretty strong advance word that they would be
good. The health insurance numbers do not come out Thursday, but next
Monday.
