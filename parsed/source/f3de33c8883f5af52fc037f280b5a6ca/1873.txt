TEXT:
Coke has called Jonathan Alter of Newsweek to tell him about their summit
commitment ($50 million for at risk HS and junior HS kids to tutor/mentor
elementary school kids) .

Therefore, the Corporation feels like they have to send it to Alter as
part of their weekly submission of commitments.  It's hard to argue with
this, but let me know asap if you want me -to.
