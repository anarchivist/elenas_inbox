    For Rahm and Elena to review. We need to makes sure that at least a
    non-practicing attorney glances at this --though I think it's pretty safe.

                       DRAFT STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT
                                 February 23, 1998


This morning the Supreme Court declined to review and, thus, left intact the community
notification provision of New Jersey's "Megan's Law." Megan's Law provides families and
communities with a crucial tool to protect their children from known sex predators. That is why
my Administration has defended its constitutionality, enacted a federal Megan's Law, and
worked with states to establish a national sex offender registry. We will continue to do
everything we can to make sure that community notification and sex offender registration laws
are enforced and upheld throughout the country.
