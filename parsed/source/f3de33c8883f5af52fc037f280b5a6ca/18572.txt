TEXT:
I have talked with Bobby Rozen who agrees with me that we need to make a
strong statement this week in support of the General Counsel's
recommendation that the Commission approve a draft notice of a proposed
rulemaking to virtually eliminate "soft money" fundraising by the national
party committees. While the odds of the Commission taking any action are
slim, they are almost non-existent without some pressure from the
Administration.  In addition, a statement from us, before this draft
notice of a proposed rulemaking becomes public, insures that the President
continues to get credit for his efforts on banning soft money.


Below is a proposed statement and my earlier e-mail describing the
recommendations of the FEC General Counsel:

        "I want to applaud the General Counsel of the Federal Elections
Commission (FEC)  for proposing a ban of "soft money" fundraising by
national party committees.  While this proposed rulemaking does not fully
meet my request for a complete ban of "soft money", it would
significantly decrease the impact of soft money on our political system
and I call on the Commission to adopt the General Counsel's recommendation
at their February 12 meeting.

        I am pleased that the General Counsel has concluded, as I stated in my
petition of June 7, 1997, that banning "soft money" fundraising is within
the FEC's existing statutory authority. I believe this authority should
be fully exercised by the Commission.  Banning "soft money" fundraising by
national party committees will enable our election laws to catch up with
the reality of the way elections are financed today, and along with new
campaign finance reform legislation, will take significant strides toward
restoring public confidence in the campaign finance process.



        But the proposed rulemaking of the General Counsel is not the
total solution. It remains imperative that Congress pass legislation that
deals with other soft money issues such as state party spending and issue
advocacy.  I challenge Congress to pass the McCain-Feingold and
Shays-Meehan bills this Spring. The American people deserve nothing less."

Subject:         FEC Petition

         In response to the President's petition to ban "soft money" and
the petitions of Members of Congress, the FEC's General Counsel is
recommending that the Commission approve a draft notice of a proposed
rulemaking to virtually eliminate "soft money" fundraising by the national
party committees, and require them to defray nearly all of their expenses,
including their mixed activity expenses, with hard dollars.   The proposal
also recommends the following:

1.      Seeks comments to on ways to ensure that transfers of both hard
and soft money from national to state and local party committees and to
non-profit organizations do not circumvent the 1991 allocation rules;

2.      Seeks comments on an alternative approach that would allow
national party committees to raise and spend soft money for nonfederal
candidates;

3.      Describes a number of approaches for ensuring that state and
local committees do not use soft dollars to influence federal elections,
including requiring state and local party committees to pay for their
mixed activities entirely with hard dollars (this is not clear whether the
Commission has the jurisdiction to implement such a rule). Another
approach would involve earmarking;

4.      Seeks comments on the possibility of requring additional
reporting by state and local party committees in order to enable the
Commission to monitory compliance with these proposals, should they be
implemented;

5.      Requires state and local committees to allocate the costs of
generic voter drives whether they are conducted directly by the party
committee or are financed by the party committee and conducted by another
entity;

6.      Establishes new rules to make it clear that all contributions
that result from a solicitation made by a federal candidate or
officeholder are subject to FECA, unless the donor expressly designates
the contribution for an otherwise permissable nonfederal account, sucha s
a building fund account.


        The Commission will consider this draft notice of proposed
rulemaking for publication in the Federal Register on February 12, 1998.
I would recommend we strongly support the Commission taking that action.
While this rulemaking does not completely ban soft money, it would
establish new limits on the fundraising and use of soft money.

        please advise.
