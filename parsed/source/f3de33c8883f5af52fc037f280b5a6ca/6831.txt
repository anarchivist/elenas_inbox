TEXT:
Here is a first cut at draft langauage for a sense of the Senate provision
to be added to Daschle's bill in place of his data collection section.  It
may be that we want to shorten this, but let me know.  Mary

SEC. XXX         SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCREASED INFORMATION ON
WAGE DISPARITIES

        It.is the Sense of the Senate that the Federal Government should
take appropriate steps to increase the amount of information available
with respect to the wage disparity.  In so doing, the Federal Government
should consider ways of collecting this data that:
        (1)     do not jeopardize individualsO, privacy;
        (2)     are least intrusive to businesses;
        (3)     retain confidentiality of corporate data;
                 (4)    are cost-effective; and
        (5)     are least burdensome to businesses and government.
