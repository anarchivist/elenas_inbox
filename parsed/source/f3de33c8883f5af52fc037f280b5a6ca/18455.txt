                          Questions and Answers on Food Safety
                                    January 19, 1998



Q:   What steps is the Administration taking to improve food safety?

A:   Last year we were able to increase spending on food safety by approximately $40 million.
      This year, our budget will seek an even more substantial increase in resources to
     improve food safety. The resources will go to a variety of initiatives, including: giving
     FDA authority to prevent the import of produce from countries without safety precautions
     equivalent to our own; hiring FDA inspectors to improve the safety of our nation's fruits
     and vegetables, both domestic and imported; developing new ways for federal inspectors
     to detect food-borne illnesses in meat and poultry and determine the source of
     contamination; improving educational outreach on proper food handling; and expanding
     CDC's surveillance activities for food-borne illnesses.


Q.   Is this a new issue for the Administration?

A.   No, our actions are part of a continuing effort that has seen real accomplishment every
     year:

     *       October,1997. President announces new initiative to enhance FDA oversight
     over imported foods and to develop guidance on good agricultural and manufacturing
     practices for fruits and vegetables; to seek legislation to give FDA the same authority that
     USDA has to inspect imports; and to seek funds to greatly expand FDA's inspection
     force.

     *      January, 1997. Administration announces comprehensive new initiative to
     improve the safety of nation's food supply detailing a $43 million food safety program,
     including measures to improve surveillance, outbreak response, education, and research.

     *       August, 1996. President signs Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. The law
     requires drinking water systems to protect against dangerous contaminants like
     cryptosporidium, and gives people the right to know about contaminants in their tap
     water.

     *      August, 1996. President signs Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, which
     streamlines regulation of pesticides by FDA and EPA and puts important new
     public-health protections in place, especially for children.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

     *      July, 1996. President Clinton announces new regulations that modernize the
     nation's meat and poultry inspection system for the first time in 90 years. New standards
     help prevent E.coli bacteria contamination in meat.

     *       December, 1995. Administration issues new rules to ensure seafood safety.
     Utilizes HACCP regulatory programs to require food industries to design and implement
     preventive measures and increase the industries' responsibility for and control of their
     safety assurance actions.

     *      1994. CDC embarks on strategic program to detect, prevent, and control
     emerging infectious disease threats, some of which are food borne, making significant
     progress toward this goal in each successive year.

     *     1993. Vice-President's National Performance Review issues report
     recommending government and industry move toward a system of preventive controls.


Q.   A recent story revealed that USDA did not close down a plant despite 1,700
     violations, what are you doing to make sure our meat and poultry are safe to eat?

A.   We do need to keep doing a better job on food safety. And I am committing more
     resources than ever to the problem, and modernizing food safety for meat and fruits and
     vegetables and the water we drink. There are several important facts to remember in
     regard to this specific story. First, in every instance cited in the story, inspectors took
     action to prevent unsafe food from reaching consumers and to correct unacceptable
     practices by the plant. Second, the story is based largely on events in 1996. Since that
     time the Administration has developed the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
     (HACCP) which we began implementing in January 1997. Under this system the Food
     Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) can insist on preventative measures to improve food
     safety before a plant can reopen. Under HACCP inspectors will use non-compliance
     reports to document food safety violations. These actions will lay the groundwork for
     documenting repeated failures. And where there are repeat failures, FSIS can and will
     take formal action to shut down the plant. Finally, the Administration has asked
     Congress for additional enforcement authority to fine companies for violations of food
     safety standards. Currently, USDA can't fine companies that violate food safety
     standards.
