TEXT:
I just got off the phone with Caroline Smith DeWaal -- the NY Times had
already called her and so she called me.   I told her about the change in
the co-chairs, and she was a little apprehensive.   I told her that it
would be a strong group, but she thought that this was a weaker
configuration.   She is not familiar with OSTP.  I tried to allay her
concerns and I think I made some headway by emphasizing that for the first
time that the planning and budget processes will be coordinated; however,
I think she is still a little concerned because she is not familiar with
OSTP.   I emphasized the legislation, etc. and it seemed to help a
little.
