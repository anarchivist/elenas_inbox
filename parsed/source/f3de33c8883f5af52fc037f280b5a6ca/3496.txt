TEXT:
Tomorrow's papers may have stories about the GAO Report on State Child
Support Computer Systems, which says that $2.7 billion federal dollars
have been spent on child support computer systems since 1988 and yet some
states won't make the October 1st deadline for having them up and
running.    (HHS thinks about 40 states will meet the deadline.)  Our
answer is that we are disappointed that some states will fail to meet the
deadline.  Congress gave them funding, HHS gave them technical assistance,
and some states have fallen down on the job. However, the funds spent
weren't wasted: the systems created helped collect $88 billion in child
support over that period.

Remember, these computer systems rules were created by the 1988 Family
Support Act; last year's law merely extended the deadline until this
October to give states more time.

The report was commissioned by Congressman Hyde, who is expected to
introduce legislation calling for a federalized child support collection
system run by the IRS.

I have HHS's Q&As on this if anyone needs them.
