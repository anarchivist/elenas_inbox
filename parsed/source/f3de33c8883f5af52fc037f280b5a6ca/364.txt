TEXT:
I hear it second-hand from Emily. If you want the full story, she
may be at home today at I P6/(b)(6) I
I may have a Medicaid issue for you today -- maybe 2; I assume
you're the person.
Issue 1: The question is in Section 114 of Title I, clause (b)
vs. (d). Clause (b) is the thing that said states have to keep
Medicaid where it was pre-reform, by doing Medicaid eligibility
according to the rules in effect in July 1996-, essentially
requiring dual eligibility systems for Medicaid and TANF.
Clause (d) says that states can use Medicaid eligibility rules
from their waivers instead if they want to. Rumors are that HCFA
may interpret (d) to mean that they don't have to obey (b)
thereby potentially gutting one of the key achievements of the
bill from our perspective by letting states cut Medicaid
eligibility. At least so the advocates (Center on Budget, -Sara
Rosenbaum) say. I am investigating.
