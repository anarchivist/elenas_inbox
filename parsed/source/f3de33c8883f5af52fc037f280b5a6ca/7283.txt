Michelle/EK:

Here's a draft of the statement Rahm requested this morning on the DOJ

but we need to make sure EK has a chance to look at it.  Let me know if
this works or not.

                                  Statement by the President

       The report on jail inmates released by the Justice Department today confirms the urgent
need for government at all levels to pursue a policy of coerced abstinence for drug offenders. It
shows that more than half the the criminals in jails are using more drugs, committing more
crimes, and returning to the streets with dangerous drug habits. The time is now to install a
tough system of testing, treatment and punishment for drug offenders. Congress can take the
lead by adopting my Administration's proposals to promote coerced abstinence throughout the
criminal justice system.
