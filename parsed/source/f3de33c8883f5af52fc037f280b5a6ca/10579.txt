     TEXT:
     Maria (Echaveste) will hold a meeting TODAY at 6:30 p.m. in her office to
     review Presidential initiatives and budget items that relate to efforts of
     the President's Initiative on Race and how we should discuss/highlight
     those issues in the State of the Union and budget rollouts.

     The meeting will cover:
     1)      the substance of those budget items;
     2)      products needed to discuss them; and
     3)      outreach on the items --- who, when, where and how.

     We need to be prepared to discuss these race-related initiatives, themes
     and budget items as we undertake SOTU briefings next week with Members,
     elected officials and constituents.  If you cannot attend this meeting,
     please be sure to send a representative from your office.
