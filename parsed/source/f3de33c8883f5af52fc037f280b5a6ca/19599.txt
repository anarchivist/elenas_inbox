Subject:         Caucus Group on Child Care

Jen:

        Andi King just let me know that the House Democratic Caucus Child
Care group has been set up ("at least on paper"). The first meeting is
scheduled for this Thursday at 2:30 PM in room HC-9 in the Capitol.  I'll
get the list of MC's to you as soon as I get it.

        Andi suggested that the Admin would probably want to have a
presence at this meeting. We should get together and discuss.

           Jen: could you contact whomever needs to know about this.   Thanks.
