Elena,
FYI. After a meeting today between civil rights enforcement agencies and
the CBC, Eleanor Holmes Norton asked Bill White (leg. affairs from EEOC)
why the EEOC had not made a deal with the Republicans on testers.  Bill
let her know that this was a WH issue. Rep. Norton then indicated that
she may want to contact someone here to discuss.
As you know, the EEOC has worked out agreements with the Reps. on the
other five points that Gingrich outlined in his testimony at the oversight
hearing. Also, we (EEOC and us -- including Counsel's office and Leg.
Affairs) have discussed offering a letter from.EEOC to Fawell indicating
that the agency would not use FY99 appropriated funds to employ testers.
Ellen Vargyas (legal counsel EEOC) has had very preliminary discussions
with Fawell's staff about this possibility. Also, Martha Foley and
Broderick Johnson have been talking the Dems. over the past couple of days
to better determine our strength on this issue.
Tomorrow morning (Thurs.) at lOam, Broderick, Martha, Eddie Correia, Susan
Carr (OMB) and I are having a conference call to finalize where we are
with the Dems. and Reps.

Julie
