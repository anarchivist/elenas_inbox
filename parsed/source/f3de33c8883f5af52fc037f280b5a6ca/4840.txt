Quality Commission Preliminary "Bill of Rights". The Quality Commission has finished a draft of
the bill of rights you requested they submit to you this fall. The bill of rights includes a wide
range of consumer protections recommendations that health plans should have including access
to specialists and emergency services, participation in treatment options (e.g. anti-gag rules), and
choice of health plans.. At this point, the Commission will not recommend an enforcement
mechanism for the bill of rights, which will help mitigate the criticisms from the business
community. We expect there may be significant coverage of this in the next week. The
Commission is meeting to discuss their final recommendations and plans to submit them to you
in the middle of November.

Breast Cancer Event. You and the First Lady are taping next week's radio address on breast
cancer at an event with the breast cancer community and the sponsors of PSAs. The radio
address will include a number of new initiatives on breast cancer such as: a new FDA rule
ensuring high quality standards for mammography; a new education campaign at NIH to ensure
that health care providers and women have information consistent with new recommendations
that women 40-49 should have regular mammograms; the First Lady's annual mammography
campaign; new reforms in the balanced budget which provide copayments for mammograms and
new outreach efforts to encourage minority Medicare beneficiaries to get regular mammograms;
as well as this year's PSAs on mammograms.

Children's Outreach. We had an encouraging meeting with the National Governors' Association
on children's outreach. They were very receptive to new ideas on outreach in schools and child
care centers to help target uninsured children. One possible option that most interested NGA
was accessing the $500 million administrative and outreach fund currently allocated for states to
help assure that children moving off welfare rolls do not lose Medicaid eligibility. The new
option would allow this money to go to help children enroll in either Medicaid or the new
children's health care program.

Medicare Commission. The Senate Republican Leadership are likely to appoint two members
and two health policy experts. They are considering Senator Gramm and either Senator Frist
(favored by the Leadership but opposed by some concerned about family ties to
Q:>lumbia/HCA) or Senator Roth (Chairman of Senate Finance who is making a big push to be
on this). The two health care experts are likely to be Debbie Steeleman (Bush Administration
Chair of the Steeleman Health Care Commission) and a health policy expert from the state of
Mississippi. The House Republicans are likely to appoint Rep. Thomas and Rep. Bilikaris (the
two health subcommittee Chairs on the committees of jurisdiction over Medicare). Their two
other slots appear wide open, although possibilities include Gail Wilensky (PPRC), Stuart Butler
(Heritage Foundation), Horace Deets (AARP).

The Senate Democrats are considering Senators Kerrey and Rockefeller, although Senator
Daschle is still sensitive to choosing only members and would still like to trade Rockefeller for
one of our choices. Congressman Gephardt does not seem to have concerns about only picking
                                                                      Au1.0mated ReQord~ Management System

    members and is likely to choose Rep_ Stark and Rep. Dingell, the two health subcommittee
    chairs on Medicare, similar to the House Republicans. The latest nominations we are hearing
    on possible Chair selection by Republican leadership are Rep. Bob Michel (R-IL), former Rep.
    Bill Frenzel (R-MN), and former Rep. Barbra Conable (R-NY).

    Medicaid and Tobacco. In recent testimony before the Senate Labor Committee, Donna Shalala
    indicated that it was our intention to send letters to states who have made settlements with the
    tobacco industry that affirm the Federal government's statutory authority to its portion of any
    Medicaid savings. Under current law, the Federal government is entided to, and consistendy
    claims, its share of dollars that have subsequendy been recaptured by the states in their
    administration of the Medicaid program. We do this for example when states obtain setdements
    in fraud and abuse cases and other provider overpayments all the time.

     Many states reacted quite negatively to the Secretary's comments and are taking the position that
      most if not all of their settlements with the industry have no legitimate Federal claim. They
    . strongly urged us not to send out any such letters that would undermine Federal/state
      relationships. The Justice Department and lawyers at HHS are urging us to proceed with the
      letters for fear that any decision to recant the Secretary's testimony would indicate our willingness
      not to enforce the law. We are now reviewing options within the White House, HHS, and
      DO], Our current thinking is to moderate the tone of the letters to simply notify the Federal
      interest in recapture of Medicaid dollars and to indicate that our mutual interest in assuring that
      any national settlement addresses the Federal/state allocation of dollars from the industry in a
      mutually acceptable manner. It is unclear as of this time whether this kind of modification
      would be determined legally acceptable by Justice Department.
