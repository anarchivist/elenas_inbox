On the cost per AmeriCorps member, here is some info:

Average cost per AmeriCorps member for fiscal year' 1996 -- $17,629.
Agreement with Grassley will reduce that to $17,000 for fiscal year 1997;
$16,000 for fiscal year 1998; and $15,000 by fiscal year 1999.

Most of that goes directly to the AmeriCorps member (or a school on
his/her behalf) :
$6,700 toward a living allowance of $7,600, with the remainder raised by
the local sponsor
$1,200 for barebones health insurance coverage and to assist a few members
with child-care costs       .
$4,725 for an education voucher upon completion of at least 1,700 hours of
direct service
Total Corporation-funded benefits per member: about $12,625.

Remainder pays for:
governor-appointed bipartisan commissions that run annual statewide
competitions among local nonprofit groups wishing to sponsor AmeriCorps
members
equipment, materials, recruitment, training, and oversight-costs that are
being cut as part of the reform agreement with Grassley
the Corporation
