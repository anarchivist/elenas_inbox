TEXT:
I wanted to give everyone a heads-up that the President is currently
scheduled to do 2 education events on Monday, April 19th.

1.   ESEA Event
2.   National Teacher of the Year Event

The President has indicated to the Scheduling Office that he definitely
wants to do an event with the teachers, not just a photo-op.
