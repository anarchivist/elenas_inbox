TEXT:
1. A state that has opted under its medicaid plan to cover non
cash SSI-related groups would automatically continue Medicaid for
qualified aliens after January 1.
2. A state that has not previously opted under its Medicaid state
plan to cover non-cash SSi related groups could, as always, submit
a state plan amendment to do so.
Latter is the problem.
