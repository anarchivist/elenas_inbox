TEXT:
Liz Hyman told me you are reviewing the paragraph in the directive re: the
DOJ/AG study. Bruce came up with the language and I expressed DOJ's concern to
him yesterday.  he said, "This is government. Tell them to work together."   I
let Liz know {in softer terms} that the White House would like them to work
together on this study.  I'm sure Bruce would appreciate it if you concur.
Helen Howell at 6-2702 in staff sec. office is holding up the directive pending
your comments.
Thanks.
