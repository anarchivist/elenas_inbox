TEXT:
The draft Senate SAP for Agriculture FY99 Appropriations was cleared a
couple of weeks ago but held pending floor action.  The Senate now expects
to take up the bill Tuesday (7/14).  Two new sections (bolded text for
your review) have been added concerning FDA/RU 486 and WIC.  Please
provide comments/clearance by noon, Monday (7/13).  Thanks.


S. 2159 -- AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES
                                       APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors:  Stevens (R), Alaska; Cochran (R), Mississippi)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on S. 2159, the Agriculture, Rural Development,
Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY
1999, as reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Your
consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates efforts by the Committee to
accommodate the PresidentD,s priorities within the 302(b) allocation.
However, the allocation is simply insufficient to make the necessary
investments in programs funded by this bill, as discussed below. The only
way to achieve the appropriate investment level is to offset discretionary
spending by using savings in other areas.  The PresidentD,s FY 1999 Budget
proposes levels of discretionary spending for FY 1999 that conform to the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement by providing savings through user fees and
certain mandatory programs to help finance discretionary spending.   In the
recently enacted Transportation Equity Act, Congress -- on a broad,
bipartisan basis -- took similar action in approving funding for surface
transportation programs paid for with mandatory offsets. We want to work
with the Congress on mutually-agreeable mandatory and other offsets that
could be used to increase high-priority discretionary programs, including
those funded by this bill.  In addition, we urge the Congress to adopt the
user fee proposals included in the PresidentD,s budget, which would enable
over $600 million to be directed to important initiatives such as those
proposed for food safety, nutrition programs, rural development, and
conservation.

        Below is a discussion of our specific concerns with the
Committee-reported bill. We look forward to working with you to resolve
these concerns as the bill moves forward.

Civil Rights

        The Administration is working to include in the bill a provision
that waives the statute of limitations for individuals who have previously
filed a discrimination claim against USDA. The President is personally
committed to righting any wrongs committed by USDA employees in
years past, and a great many individuals who were discriminated against
will have no recourse unless the statute of limitations is waived for
them.  We will continue to work to identify appropriate offsets for the
cost of this waiver.

        In a number of areas, the Committee has reduced funds to assist
the most needy farmers and members of the rural community. The Committee
does not provide the requested increase for the Outreach for Socially
Disadvantaged Farmers program, which was a key recommendation of the Civil
Rights Action Team (CRAT) report last year. With the additional $7
million requested, USDA could support 35 projects to assist 10,000 small
family farms and stem the continuing reduction in the number of minority
farmers and ranchers.

        Another recommendation in the CRAT report is to increase the
amount of farm ownership loans, a portion of which are targeted to
minority and beginning farmers.  The Administration urges the Senate to


provide the additional $3 million requested for this program by the
President, which would permit another 290 limited-resource farmers to
finance real estate purchases. This increase could be offset by approving
the request to eliminate the Forestry Incentives Program, which promotes
timber production on private lands.

Food Safety Initiative

         The Administration is deeply concerned that the Committee has not
fully funded the PresidentO,s request for Food and Drug Administration
 (FDA) and USDA activities to enhance food safety, providing only $2:6
million out of the $101 million the President has requested for these
activities, $96 million of which is requested in this bill.    American
consumers enjoy the worldO,s safest food supply, but too many Americans
get sick, and in some cases die, from preventable food-borne diseases.
The PresidentO,s budget increase would expand food safety research, risk
assessment capabilities, education, surveillance activities, and food
import inspections. We want to work with the Congress to explore user fee
options within FDA and USDA that can be used to offset the cost of the
needed increases in these programs as well as provide funds to modernize
further the meat and poultry inspection system.

Food and Drug Administration:    Drug Safety

        The Administration would strongly oppose an amendment that may be offered
that would intervene in the drug safety practices of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and place restrictions on scientific research that
can protect women's health and offer safe medical choices.  We urge the
Senate not to include language that would interfere with the FDA's
continued use of rigorous testing and the highest scientific standards to
protect the public health. [If such language is included in the bill
presented to the President, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services
and Agriculture would recommend that he veto the bill.]

Women,   Infants, and Children

         The Committee bill would freeze funding for the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) at
the FY 1998 level of $3.9 billion, $157 million below the PresidentO,s
request.   This would only support a participation level of between 7.3 and
7.4 million women, infants, and children, and, based on FY 1998 year-end
projections, would mean cutting off over 100,000 needy participants from
the program.   The PresidentO,s request would maintain participation at 7.5
million, fulfilling the bipartisan commitment to fully fund WIC.   The
Administration strongly encourages the Senate to fund WIC at the
PresidentO,s requested level.

        On language issues regarding administration of the WIC program, the
Administration prefers the language included in the PresidentO,s budget,
in order to maintain the viability of infant formula rebates and so that
funds are used to satisfy the highest priority WIC needs first.  The
Administration also supports transferring the Farmers' Market Nutrition
Program to the Commodity Assistance Program, in order to prevent the
diversion of already limited WIC resources from supporting program
participation.

Arms Export Control Act Modification

        The Administration supports section 738, which will ensure that
American farmers can continue to export wheat and other commodities to


India and Pakistan through USDA export assistance programs. As the
President recently announced, in the sanctions the U.S. is applying toward
those countries, we are attempting within the constraints of the Act to
minimize the humanitarian impact on their people and adverse effects on
American agriculture.   Cutting off the supply of U.S. wheat would only
hurt the citizens of Pakistan and India, as well as American farmers,
without furthering the goal of nuclear nonproliferation.

Rural Development Funding

        The Administration strongly objects to the CommitteeO,s blocking
the mandatory Fund for Rural America from being used in FY 1999. The Fund
provides additional resources for rural development and innovative
agricultural research that are vitally needed to improve the quality of
life in rural America and increase the productivity of U.S. farmers.  The
intent of Congress in creating the Fund in 1996 was to boost the overall
Federal investment in these activities, not to offset discretionary
spending in them.  Furthermore, Congress recently extended the authority
for the Fund while increasing its resources.  We urge the Senate to strike
this provision.

        In addition, the Committee has not fully funded the PresidentO,s
request for the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP), under funding
direct loans for water and wastewater and for community facilities.   These
loans provide the community infrastructure needed to improve the quality
of life of rural Americans, and often finance the vital ingredient for
diversifying the rural economy. The Committee bill would result in an
estimated 35 fewer water and wastewater facilities serving 50,000 rural
residents, and 75 fewer rural health clinics, police and fire stations,
and child care facilities being built.   Furthermore, for the RCAP program
to be adaptable to unique local economic development needs, as envisioned
in its 1996 Farm Bill authorization, the Senate should strike the
CommitteeO,s limitation on the flexibility to transfer funds among
programs and allow the program to be implemented as authorized.

Food and Drug Administration

        The Administration strongly urges the Congress to provide the full
$1,251 million in resources to fund the program level proposed for the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the PresidentD,s budget. The
Administration is deeply disappointed and concerned that the Committee has
not funded the presidentO,s request for FDAO,S tobacco enforcement
activities. This funding is vital to the AdministrationO,s plan to reduce
youth smoking. CongressO, failure thus far to pass comprehensive tobacco
legislation should not prevent the Committee from providing adequate
resources for these critical public health activities. We will work with
the Congress to develop the appropriate means of funding.

Agricultural Research

        The Committee bill includes over $50 million in unrequested
earmarks for lower-priority research while funding competitive grants
through the National Research Initiative (NRI) at $33 million below the
PresidentO,s request.  The rejection of additional funds for competitive
research grants for national and regional priorities, in favor of
earmarked grants for more local or industry-specific requests, will slow
progress toward addressing the most pressing needs of American agriculture
and food consumers, and we urge the Senate to reverse this course of
action.  It can do so not only by reducing earmarked grants in the bill,
but by reducing the $9 million in unrequested increases for the


Agricultural Research ServiceD,s buildings and facilities program. A task
force created by the 1996 Farm Bill to review the NationD,s agricultural
research facilities comprehensively is due to report to Congress next
year, and further construction should be minimized until the
Administration and Congress have had the opportunity to review the report.

Climate Change and Clean Water Initiatives, and Conservation Programs

         The Committee has not provided any of the $7 million increase
requested for additional research as part of the AdministrationD,s Climate
Change Technology Initiative. These funds would support high-priority
research to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases caused by agricultural
practices, develop improved feedstocks that can be used to generate
energy, and improve techniques to convert agricultural products to
biofuels. The Administration urges the Senate to provide the necessary
funding.

        The Committee also has not included the AdministrationD,s
requested increase of $23 million for the Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) to implement the PresidentD,s Clean Water Action Plan to
help State and local organizations hire watershed coordinators, document
baseline conditions, and target resources to farmers requesting
assistance. The Plan, developed by USDA and EPA, outlines a strategy on
how to address water quality problems, including polluted runoff, in
watershed areas across the Nation. The Administration urges the Senate to
provide these necessary funds to the NRCS.

        In addition, the Administration is concerned with reductions in
the Committee bill to USDA mandatory conservation programs. The bill
eliminates funds to carry out a Conservation Farm Option program, and
reduces signups under the Wetlands Reserve Program by 25,000 acres, to
140,000 acres.  These programs provide technical and financial assistance
to farmers to enable them to manage their land efficiently while providing
environmentally-beneficial improvements to wetlands, wildlife habitat,
soil erosion, and water quality. Taken together, the reductions in the
bill to conservation and environmental programs are objectionable, and we
want to work with the Senate to restore funding in this area.

Other Issues

  Additional funds are needed for the farm labor housing program to
improve the living conditions many farm labor families endure. The
CommitteeD,s level of $16 million in direct loans is more than 50 percent
below the AdministrationD,s request and, when coupled with the billD,s $3
million reduction below the request for farm labor grants, would mean that
over 350 fewer housing units would be built compared with the request. We
urge the Senate to increase funding to assist these needy members of our
society. This could be achieved by shifting $11.5 million from the amount
in the bill that is in excess of the PresidentD,s request for multi-family
housing direct loans.

 The Committee bill includes a $20 million reduction to the PresidentD,s
request for the mandatory Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which
purchases commodities for individuals greatly in need of assistance.
Given reported increases in need for food assistance through food banks
and soup kitchens, the Administration is concerned that this reduction
from the authorized level would mean less food will reach the most
vulnerable Americans.

The Administration objects to section 721 of the Committee bill, which


would limit Executive Branch review of USDA responses to congressional
inquiries. Congress expects the Administration to be responsible for
agency activities. This provision erodes that responsibility and is
contrary to the widespread congressional view that more, not less,
accountability is needed for improved management results. The
Administration urges the Senate to delete the provision.

 The Administration objects to section 735 of the Committee bill, which
would prohibit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from consolidating
laboratory operations. The proposed consolidation offers the opportunity
for better efficiency and mission coordination, and it is part of FDAO,s
overall streamlining goals. This provision would force FDA to spend funds
on infrastructure that could otherwise be used more directly to protect
public health. The Administration urges the Senate to delete this provis
ion.

 The Committee has provided none of the requested $22 million increase for
the Inspector General as part of the AdministrationO,s law enforcement
initiative. This USDA initiative would save taxpayers millions of dollars
lost through fraud in the food and nutrition programs, in USDA disaster,
multi-family housing, and other programs, as well as improve the integrity
of USDA programs. The Administration urges the Senate to increase funds
for this important initiative.

 The Committee bill provides funding for research on nutrition programs
within the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The Administration is very
pleased that funding for these activities is returned to the FNS, where
research on nutrition programs will occur in the context of the programD,s
administration.
