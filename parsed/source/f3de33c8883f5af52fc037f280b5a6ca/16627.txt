Elena -- please review the SHORT draft response to letters on the
settlement, in bold below.  Sarah Knight in Presidential Correspondence
would like to use it to get a pile of letters out the door tomorrow
(letters listed below) .

Additional letters have come in from farmers, labor unions and others that
seem to merit a more focused response.  Sarah suggests we hold these until
we have something more to say.

Elizabeth,
The pro letters are from:
Gov. Locke
American Academy of Pediatrics
Washington State House of Representatives
American College of Chest Physicians

The con/want changes in the agreement letters are from:
American Lung Association
Attorney General of Maryland
American Society of Addiction Medicine
Gov. Glendening
International Society of Cardiology

I am faxing you samples of the letters re distribution of money from the
agreement and the Kentucky tobacco farmers.

Here is the general language for the tobacco settlement letters:

Thank you for writing about the proposed tobacco settlement.



The recent settlement agreement proposed by the state attorneys
general, the tobacco industry, and others provides another potential
opportunity to build on the progress we have already made in
protecting our children from tobacco.  Congress would have to approve
the agreement before it goes into effect.  I have asked my domestic
policy advisor, Bruce Reed, and the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, Donna Shalala, to carefully review the agreement with
Administration staff, to listen to public health experts, and to help
me ensure that any agreement that goes forward to congress is in the
best interest of the public health, especially the health of our
children.

As we review the agreement, I appreciate your interest and I hope you
will remain involved as we work to create a healthier future for our
children.

Please let me know ASAP if the general language is OK.   Thanks!   Sarah
