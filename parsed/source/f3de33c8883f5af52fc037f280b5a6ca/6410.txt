     STRENGTHENING PUBLIC SCHOOLS BY RAISING STANDARDS, RAISING
              EXPECTATIONS, RAISING ACCOUNTABILITY
                           February 23, 1998
 "Every American who is willing to work and study hard can now afford college", We've thrown open the doors to
higher learning Now, we must continue working to make sure all our children can walkthrough them and seize
the opportunities of the future, That is why in my balanced budget, / am proposing the largest commitment to K-/2
education in history -- a comprehensive plan to raise standards, raise expectations and raise accountability in our
schools, "

                                                              President Bill Clinton
                                                              February 20, 1998

Ending Social Promotions. President Clinton announced that, before the next school year
begins, the Education Department will release a guidebook that will tell every state, school
district and school how to end social promotions -- the practice of promoting students from grade
to grade even if they have not learned the material and met academic standards. The President
called on the Education Department to help schools design programs that (1) prepare students to
meet standards on time (by providing them with grade-by-grade standards and a rigorous
curriculum, smaller classes, and well prepared teachers, and by identifying students who need
extra help early on and providing them the help they need); (2) provide students who do not meet
the standard with immediate help such as after-school and summer school programs; and (3)
provide effective interventions for students who must be retained.

Keeping National Standards and Tests on a Bipartisan Track. President Clinton announced
today that Secretary of Education Riley has appointed Gov. John Engler (R. Michigan) to serve
on the National Assessment Governing Board, the independent, bipartisan body responsible for
overseeing the development of voluntary national tests in the basic skills. Gov. Engler fills the
NAGB seat representing Republican governors, and joins Gov. Roy Romer (D. Colorado) as the
two gubernatorial members ofNAGB. Under Gov. Engler's leadership, Michigan was the
second state in the Nation to announce its participation in the testing program.

A National Effort to Help States Reduce Class Size. President Clinton called on Congress to
enact his proposal for a national effort to reduce class size in grades 1-3 to a national average of
18. Calling for a federal/state partnership to provide smaller classes with qualified teachers so
that every student receives personal attention, gets a solid foundation for further learning, and
masters the basic skills in reading and math, President Clinton praised recent class size reduction
initiatives in state such as California, Nevada and Wisconsin as well as new class size reduction
proposals in Delaware and other states.

President Clinton also pointed to findings from a recent evaluation of Wisconsin's SAGE
(Student Achievement Guarantee in Education) Program, a statewide initiative to reduce the
student-teacher ratio to 15: I in kindergarten through third grade. The first-year evaluation
shows that first grade students in smaller classes, when compared to similar students in schools
not participating in the program, made significant gains in reading, language arts and math. The
study reported that the smaller class sizes provided by the SAGE program were particularly
·.                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

         effective for improving achievement among low income students and African-American
         students. When combined with the widely reported findings from the Tennessee STAR
         program, this study underscores that research, together with the common sense of teachers and
         parents, shows that reducing class size will help improve student achievement.


         Freeing Schools from Red Tape: Accountability and Flexibility in Federal Education
         Programs.        President Clinton announced today that he would send Congress legislation
         permitting each state to waive most statutory and regulatory requirements in key federal
         elementary and secondary education programs. To be eligible, a state must be able to waive its
         own regulations on schools, and must hold schools accountable for results by setting academic
         standards and measuring student performance, requiring schools to public school report cards and
         by intervening in low performing schools. School reports cards must show student progress
         toward meeting academic standards for the school as a whole and disaggregated to demographic
         subgroups.

         The President's proposal would expand the existing Ed-Flex demonstration program, part of the
         Goals 2000 Act, which is now limited to 12 states under current law. It authorizes state
         education agencies to waive most statutory and regulatory requirements in federal elementary and
         secondary education programs, and requires states to provide the same flexibility to local schools
         with respect to their own education regulations.

         President Clinton's proposal will affect all programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education
         Act, including the Title 1 Program that provides extra help to disadvantaged students, the Safe
         and Drug Free Schools and Communities Program, the Eisenhower Professional Development
         Program, and the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. States may not
         waive civil rights requirements or provisions of the Individual with Disabilities Education Act.

         Expanding Ed-Flex is part of a long-standing effort by the Clinton Administration to reinvent
         federal education programs. Since the 1994 enactment of Goals 2000, the Education
         Department has cut elementary and secondary program regulations by 69%, administered new
         programs such as Goals 2000 and School-to-Work without any new regulations; provided
         waivers to federal education requirements for the first time in history in order to allow states and
         school districts to use federal education funds in a manner that best support their education
         reforms. Since 1994, the Education Department has provided nearly 250 waivers to school
         districts in 49 states. In an additional 140 instances, no waivers were necessary for school
         districts to carry out the desired activities. Twelve states--Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,
         Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Texas and Vermont--already
         participate in Ed-Flex.
