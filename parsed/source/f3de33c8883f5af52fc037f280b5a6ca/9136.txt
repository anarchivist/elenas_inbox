         Subject: AIDS, gay groups support Dem's managed care proposals

         WASHINGTON BLADE

         AIDS, GAY GROUPS SUPPORT DEMS' MANAGED CARE PROPOSALS:

         Of four bills floating in Congress which propose reforms to group health
         plans, AIDS and Gay lobby groups say that the two Democratic versions offer
         the most security to people with HIV/AIDS and Gays.

         In recent weeks, GOP leadership in both chambers introduced competing
         versions of the two managed care reform bills introduced in the House and
         Senate by Democrats in March. The House passed its GOP version by a vote of
         216-210 on July 24. The Senate did act on either the House GOP bill or
         either Senate bill before departing for August recess on July 31. GOP
         leadership has said that debate on the bills will be a top priority upon
         returning in September.

         The Democratic versions both explicitly forbid group health plans from
         discriminating against patients and health care providers based on sexual


orientation. Neither GOP version offers this protection. The Human Rights
Campaign has sent letters to legislators in both chambers noting this and
other advantages of the Democratic versions for Gays and people with AIDS.

AIDS Action is also urging legislators not to pass either GOP bill. In a
July 22 letter to senators, AIDS Action head Daniel Zingale registered the
group's support for the Democratic proposals and listed the ways in which
the GOP proposals fail to "meet key quality standards" for people with
HIV/AIDS. Among those critiques were that the bills leave the door open for
plans to deny access to specialists and clinical trials, fail to provide
insurance of confidentiality for medical records, and leave health plans
with the authority to determine what treatments constitute medical
necessities. The National Association of People with AIDS also has
registered its opposition to the GOP proposals and its support for the
Democratic proposals.

Among other patient protections, the Democratic proposals would prevent
health plans from denying access to treatments based solely on plan
administrators' deeming them "investigational," require plans to create an
external appeals processes for patient grievances - including those
grievances related to access to medical treatments, and require health
plans to offer access to specialists.
