Rules Keep Welfare Aid Unspent

                            By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer

                            WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ana Osegueda spends her days
                            helping move people in San Francisco from
welfare to work,
                            but she sends only a handful of clients through
the federal
                            government's welfare-to-work program.

                            The $3 billion program was meant to help people
with the
                            toughest problems -- people who may have been
left in dire
                            straits by strict new welfare rules. But rigid
rules about who is
                            eligible, combined with other problems, have
left some 92
                            percent of the first year's money unspent after
a year and a half.

                            "It's really hard to find someone checking
'yes' in all those
                            boxes, "   Osegueda said.

                            That's been the case across the country.
Michigan, one of the
                            first states to get its money, hasn't spent a
dime due to strict
                            rules. In New York City, where most long-term
welfare
                            recipients live, there is no one enrolled.

                            "This is depressingly slow considering it
started so long ago,


                         but usually once these things start moving, they
start moving, ' ,
                         said John Twomey, who runs an umbrella 'group for
county
                         boards in New York that distribute the federal
money.

                         Clinton administration officials are asking
Congress to change
                         the rules so more people can qualify. They also
want an
                         additional $1 billion in 2000.

                         But local welfare directors are urging Congress
to spend the
                         money elsewhere. And at least one key lawmaker
agrees.

                         --We're certainly not going to put more money
into it, because
                         it's not working,"    said Rep. Nancy Johnson,
R-Conn., who
                         chairs the House Ways and Means welfare
subcommittee.

                         Johnson predicted, however, that Congress will
change the
                         rules to make it easier for more people to
qualify, particularly
                         low-income fathers of children on welfare.

                         Officials in the states and at the Labor
Department, which runs
                         the program, cite several problems,   including
bureaucratic
                         delays getting it started as well as the
eligibility rules.

                         To participate, most recipients must have spent
at least 2 1/2
                         years on welfare or must be nearing their
lifetime limit for
                         benefits. They must also have two of three other
problems:
                         substance abuse, a poor work history and low
educational
                         skills -- defined as no high school diploma plus
poor reading
                         ability.

                         That means someone who has been on welfare for
five years,
                         has a drug problem and can't read wouldn't
qualify i f they
                         graduated from high school.

                         --If you have a high school diploma but can't
read it, we can't
                         serve you, "   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman
complained.



                      Herman wants Congress to ease the eligibility
rules, hoping to
                      focus more on absentee dads.    "We can't finish
the job of
                      welfare reform without doing more to help people
who have the
                      hardest time, "    she said.

                      The federal program also has run into unexpected
competition
                      from local welfare agencies.

                      President Clinton proposed the program in 1997
hoping to help
                      Americans facing tough new welfare rules to find
work. He and
                      others feared those with the toughest problems
would be left
                      behind.

                      But, as it turned out, the new rules and the
robust economy
                      helped the welfare rolls drop faster than anyone
predicted. That
                      left states with fewer clients and more money to
serve them.

                      The program got under way in October 1997, when
the Labor
                      Department released just over $1 billion to 44
states, plus the
                      District of Columbia and three territories, that
opted to
                      participate. An additional half-billion was
awarded directly to
                      communities through a competition.

                      Through March,    just $83.5 million of the state
money had been
                      spent, serving 38,705 participants. And last
October, Labor
                      got an additional $1.5 billion to distribute.

                      States, which must match every $2 of federal
money with $1 in
                      state money, have three years to spend the
grants. What isn't
                      spent goes back to the federal Treasury.

                      There are some success stories. In Philadelphia,
some 2,500
                      are working through the program, thanks in part
to an
                      advertising campaign that urges people to ask
their
                      caseworkers about the federal assistance.

                      Phylis Kelley had been on welfare for five years
when she and
.0




                        her 3-year-old son saw an ad. He asked if she
had a job, and
                        Kelley was embarrassed by the answer.

                        "r didn't have answers for him, much less
myself, "   she said.

                        She found this program different from others
she'd tried. An
                        employment adviser helped her arrange child
care, set up
                        transportation and buy work clothes -- and
promised to stick
                        with Kelley for a year, helping address whatever
problems
                        arose.

                        Kelley is now making $8.75 per hour as a
receptionist.

                        "r had no idea how many jobs were available,
she said.
                        "who knew it would be this easy?"
