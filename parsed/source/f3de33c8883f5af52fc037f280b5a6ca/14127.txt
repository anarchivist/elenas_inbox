I was hoping to avoid this, but it increasingly appears that we
all need a timeline of key dates for welfare reform.   I think we
might have a better chance of avoiding problems if we do.
I have taken a first and very rough crack at it, and would very
much appreciate it if your staff could make any additions or
corrections they find appropriate or necessary.  I know they are
very tied up on a million things, but their input would be very
helpful.
I would hope to distribute this at tomorrow's 3pm meeting of our
subgroup if it is in decent enough shape, and ask the agencies
for their help as well.
I have really tried to keep it to dates that are truly critical
or might generate outside interest/scrutiny. Obviously there are
zillions of effective dates, regs, etc., but to put them all in
the timeline would make it baffling.
I didn't get very far on child support or child care!
Can Keith or Richard.throw some dates/advice my way?
