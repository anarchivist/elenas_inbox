Cloning Update

It appears that the Republicans will introduce a bill in the Senate next
week to prohibit cloning human beings in the public and private sectors.
Although the language has not been finalized, it is likely that the bill
would seek to ban the creation of a zygote (a one-cell embryo) using
somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning technology.  This differs from our
bill in that it would preclude research on the embryo prior to
implantation, while our ban would start at introduction of the embryo into
a womanD,s uterus. Currently, such research is allowed using private
funds.  It is not certain whether or not a sunset provision would be
included. The plan is for the bill to go directly to the floor with the
blessing of Senate leadership and others (Lott, Gregg, Bond, and Frist) .
Kennedy and Feinstein are poised to introduce a bill today that is close
to the PresidentD,s (draft attached).

We have at least five options:   (1) try to work with the Senate majority
on drafting a bill; (2) declare our support for the Kennedy/Feinstein
bill; (3) issue a statement reiterating the principles in our bill in
order to influence the drafting process; (4) wait until the Senate bill
goes to the floor and then issue a SAP; or (5) do nothing and let the
biotech industry and patient advocacy groups continue to fight against
overly restrictive legislation.   Should we choose to act prior to the
floor debate, we will have to move quickly.
