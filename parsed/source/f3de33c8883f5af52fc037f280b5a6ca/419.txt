TEXT:
With about 98.9% certainty the Solicitor General will file a "Friend of the
Court" brief that supports the plaintiff in the Blessing v. Freestone case on
either September 26th or 27th.
Background
The plaintiff (Freestone) is actually 6 individual plaintiffs who sued Arizona
for failure to administer an adequate child support system. The case was thrown


out of District court on August 12, 1993. The plaintiffs found success on
October 12, 1995 when the 9th Circuit reversed the decision. On May 3, 1996
Arizona appealed under the Supreme Court - where we are now.
Freestone's Argument
There arguments range from the state's failure to establish a child support
order to the state's failure to enact wage withholding even when given the
employment information of the non-custodial parent.    The plaintiffs simply want
action.   please note, nothing in this suit entitles the plaintiffs to success,
ie. receiving child support payments. A positive outcome for the plaintiff can
only force Arizona to take some action.
Arizona's Case and APWA's Argument
 (Linda Blessing is the Director of Arizona's Dept. of Economic Security) As you
know, APWA sent a letter to you encouraging the Administration not to file a
brief. The argument of Arizona and APWA is that according to IV-A statutes
states only have to "substantially comply" which means adequately serve 75% of
the population.   (Please note that IV-D does not have compliance language
therefore IV-A is used since states must run a child support system in order to
receive IV-A funds.) APWA is also saying that the federal government is imposing
additional requirements.
HHS General Counsel and Solicitor General Perspective
The dilemma here is that to a certain degree the state is accurate. The
definition of "substantially comply" is ambiguous.    However, since states have
clearly stated Congressional guidelines as well as federal incentives to provide
better services, they should do so. Thus, while the Administration files a
brief that is diplomatic and outlines the complexity of this case it will
support the plaintiff. (HHS Counsel really wants the case to be pushed back to
the 9th Circuit for further consideration, particularly given the new welfare
rules. )
One of the issues is that states currently have no fair hearing requirements.
 (some states may have volunteer systems) So there is no way for an individual to
complain about the system and have action taken on their behalf.    In this
particular case Arizona has had one of the worst child support programs and have
been both penalized and audited in the past by HHS.
I hope this is helpful.   If any additional issues come up during the Sept. 9 -10
conference please let me know.   HHS Counsel stands ready to assist if it becomes
a major issue.
