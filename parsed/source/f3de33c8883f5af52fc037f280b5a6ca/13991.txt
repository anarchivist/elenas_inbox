 Fresh from yesterday's admin contact meeting ....
 1.       Conference Rooms - When making reservations for a
 conference room, please remember to submit a confirmation form
 (it's orange) to Room 1. Also, when meeting in any other room
 besides the Indian Treaty Room, there should be no food or drinks.
 2.       East and West Wing Emergency system will be tested at
 5:00pm today. This is not a drill, merely a system (mechanical)
 test.
 3.       OEOB Deck use - the new deck was built to be used by staff
 for eating lunches and taking breaks.   It was not built to be used
 for birthday parties or farewell receptions. The Office of
 Administration has asked that staff keep in mind the close


 proximity of the new deck to pedestrian traffic and the press.
 4.       Color Copies - A color copier is available in Room 1 to
 handle small runs (25 copies or less). To request color copies,
 you use the same procedure as a regular copy request, but bring
 everything to Room 1, not the copy center.
 5.       New/updated forms for a number of administrative procedures
 will begin to be implemented.   Please call me to get copies of the
 new forms.
 6.       NT Rollout - I think I told you about this a while ago, but
 the rollout for the new computer "desktop" will start October 1
 and is targeted to be fully implemented before January 1.
 Misc". Reminders:
          Local phone books are available in the Supply Office. When
 trying to find a phone number, please refer first to a phone book
 before calling directory assistance.
          The Internet is for official use only.  Many web sites
 record e-mail addresses of their visitors, so please remember that
 your internet use can be traced very easily.
          When you are going out of town, make sure that you leave a
 number where you can be reached with someone in the office. For
 those of you who accrue leave: please, please, please, remember to
 submit leave slips to me BEFORE you take any annual leave whenever
 that is possible.
 One last bit of information (although some of you already know
 this): I have accepted the position of White House Liaison at the
 National Endowment for the Humanities.   I don't know when exactly
 I will be leaving but foresee that date to be sometime next month.
 As always, if you have any questions about any of the above
 information, please do not hesitate to call me.

 Marna   :-)
