TEXT:
Yesterday, Treasury staff raised with Secretary Rubin the idea of
collecting information on ATM and other fees to be published over the
internet by Treasury. Apparently the Secretary went ballistic. He wants
no Treasury involvement in an issue which he believes is not a problem nor
does he feel it is correct to require banks, thrifts, and credit unions to
publish this information and not grocery stores, gas stations, etc. With
regards to the second critique, I would have no problem publishing the ATM
fees charged at non-banks but Treasury does not have the authority nor
does the mechanism exist currently to collect this information.

I still believe this is a good idea. We have a couple of options.   Push
back at Rubin or find another agency (Justice, Commerce) to do the study.

Thoughts.
