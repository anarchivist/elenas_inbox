               SUBTITLE H-EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT USER FEES



SEC. WORK OPPORTUNITY CREDIT AND WELFARE-TO-WORK CREDIT USER FEES.

       (a) ESTABLISHMENT.- Subject to subsection (e), the Secretary of Labor is authorized

to impose a fee on employers submitting applications for certification of individuals as members

of target groups under sections 51(d)(12) or 51A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26

U.S.c. 51(d)(12) and 51A(d)(1)), relating to the Work Opportunity Credit and the

Welfare-to-Work Credit, respectively. The fees imposed under this section shall not be paid,

directly or indirectly, by the individual who is the subject ofthe certification.

       (b) AMOUNT OF FEE.-The amount.ofthe fee imposed under this section shall be

determined by the Secretary of Labor based on the Secretary's estimate of the amounts needed

to fully fund the costs of administering the requirements relating to the certification of target

group members under sections 51 and 51A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 51

and 51A). The Secretary of Labor is authorized to establish a fee for employers with fewer than

100 employees at an amount that is less than the fee established for employers with 100 or more

employees.

       (c) COLLECTION AND DEPOSIT.-The fees imposed under this section shall be

collected by the Secretary of Labor through the designated local agency specified in section

51(d)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 5l(d)(11)) and deposited as offsetting

receipts in the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service Operations account of

the Treasury of the United States.
                             Hex-Dump Conversion

       (d) USE OF FUNDS.-The funds deposited pursuant to subsection (c) shall be available to

the Secretary of Labor to pay the costs of administering the requirements relating to the

certification of individuals as target group members under sections 51 and 51 A of the Internal

Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 51 and 51A). The Secretary of Labor shall allocate the funds

among the States based on the relative workload of the States in processing the certifications.

       (e) APPROPRIATIONS ACTION REQUIRED.- The fees authorized under this section

shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in

advance in appropriations acts. The fees are authorized to be appropriated to remain available

until expended.
                        Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                             DRAFT 4/6/99

                       STATEMENT IN EXPLANATION OF SUBTITLE H
                                EMPLOYER TAX CREDIT USER FEES

        Subtitle H would authorize the Secretary of Labor, subject to approval provided in
advance in appropriations acts, to impose a fee on employers submitting applications for
certification of individuals as target group members under the Work Opportunity Tax Credit
(WOTC) and the We1fare-to-Work Tax Credit (WtW) programs.

         These two employer tax credits are administered by the Secretary of Labor and the
Secretary ofthe Treasury and allow employers to claim a credit for wages paid to individuals
hired by the employer who are certified as being members of one or more target groups specified
in the law. There are eight target groups specified under the WOTC (e.g., qualified welfare
recipients, qualified veterans) and the one target group oflong-tenn family assistance recipients
specified under the WtW credit. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for accepting and
processing applications submitted by employers to certify that an individual to be hired is a
member of a target group. Under current law, the Secretary carries out the certification
responsibilities through the State employment security agencies.

         Currently, employers are not charged a fee for the processing of the application and the
administrative costs are funded from appropriations out of general revenues. However, since
employers are able to claim significant benefits under these programs, it is appropriate that they
assist in funding these administrative costs. Specifically, employers are able to claim a credit of
up to $2400 for the first $6000 in wages paid to a target group member under the WOTC, up to
$3500 for the first $10,000 in wages paid to a target group member under WtW in the first year
of employment, and up to $5,000 for the first $10,000 paid to the member under WtW in the
second year of employment.

        The amount ofthe fee would be based on the Secretary of Labor's estimate of the amount
necessary to fully fund the administration of the certification process. For example, based on
current infonnation relating to the number of certifications processed and related administrative
costs, the fee would likely be an average of$75 per application if the amount was presently
detennined. When weighed against the amounts of the credits, it is unlikely that such a fee would
be a significant burden on employers or deter employer participation in the programs. However,
in order to minimize the burden on small employers, this section would authorize the Secretary to
establish a lower fee for employers with fewer than 100 employees.

         The funds collected would be deposited as offsetting receipts in the State Unemployment
Insurance and Employment Service Operations account in the U.S.Treasury (the account that
contains the funds approriated to carry out the current certification activities and other UUES
activities) and would be available to the Secretary of Labor for the administration of the WOTC
and WtW credit target group certification process. The Secretary of Labor would allocate the
funds among States based on the relative workload of each State. This approach would assist in
providing for a stable source of funding for these administrative activities and in ensuring that
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

funds are distributed based on the relative administrative burdens on the States.

        This subtitle contains one section with five subsections. Subsection (a) authorizes the
Secretary of Labor to impose the fee on employers sUbmitting the application for certifications
under the WOTC and WtW credit programs and provides that the fee is not to be paid, directly or
indirectly, by the individual who is the subject of the certification.

       Subsection (b) provides that the amount of the fee is to be determined by the Secretary of
Labor based on the Secretary's estimate of the amounts necessary to fully fund the certification
process. In addition, the Secretary is authorized to establish a fee for employers with fewer than
100 employees that is lower than the fee established for larger employers.

        Subsection (c) provides that the fee is to be collected by the Secretary of Labor through
the designated local agency under the WOTC (i.e., the State employment security agencies) and
deposited as offsetting receipts in the State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service
Operations account of the U.S. Treasury.

        Subsection (d) provides that funds deposited in the account are available to the Secretary
of Labor to pay the costs of administering the certification processes under the WOTC and WtW
credit. The Secretary is to allocate the funds based on the relative workload of the States in
processing the certifications.

       Finally, subsection (e) provides that the fees under this section may only be collected and
available for obligation to the extent and in the amounts provided for in advance by
appropriations acts. This subsection also provides that the fees are authorized to be appropriated
to remain available until expended.
                              Hex.Dump Conversion



Questions/General Comments on the Legislation:


1.    The draft bill would allow the DOL to charge a lower fee for employers with less
      than 50 employees. Why did the Department of Labor choose this cutoff level, as
      opposed to a larger one (e.g. 500, as is generally used under other statutes)?

      The Department settled upon the threshold of 50 workers since more than 85% of aU
      employers have a workforce of less than 50 employees. However, the Department is
      wiUing to establish an employer threshold at 100 or fewer workers since employers are
      aware that employees are generally covered by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
      Notification (WARN) Act if they have at least 100 employees.

2.     What is the rationale for allowing a smaller fee (as opposed to uniformly
       establishing a smaller fee) for small employers? Why not establish a requirement
       that the fee be waived or reduced by a certain percentage? A requirement would
       provide more certainty for small businesses.

       The Department will establish unifonn non-discretionary nationwide fees -- one for
        large employers and a significantly reduced fee for smaU employers.

3      How would the size cutoff pertain to franchises (e.g. fast food restaurants)? Would
       they qualify based on the size of the establishment or the size of the parent
       company?

       Both tax liability and number of employees will detennine the applicable fee for a
       particular franchisee. In addition, the Department will work with Internal Revenue
       Service, to modify IRS Fonn 8850 to include finn size.

2.     The bill does not state whether the fee would be imposed in cases where an employer
       submits an incomplete form.

       The entire user fee will be assessed upon the employer request for the tax credit, despite
       the submittal of incomplete fonns. Since States incur an immediate administrative cost
       upon initial receipt of IRS Fonn 8850, fragmentary or subsequent payments will inflate
       the administrative cost and will minimize the States capacity to efficiently and
       effectively manage the tax credit program.
