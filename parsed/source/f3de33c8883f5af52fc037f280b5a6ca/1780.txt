TEXT:
Just hooked up with him to get his advice on summit speech.   He said he
thought we are being way too timid in general these days, saying "what
have we got to lose," and pointed to the radio address not calling for the
Maryland graduate requirement to go nation-wide as an example.   He said
that, instead of' searching for another minor executive action for the
summit speech, we should consider' building on and expanding something big
that we have already announced -- i.e., talking about next steps on
America Reads, which is in danger of disappearing from public view.
