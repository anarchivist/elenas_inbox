TEXT:
Steve Warnath and I are concerned that SSA is not on the same wave
length as USDA or HHS in terms of implementing the legal immigrant
provisions.   Since their actual cutoffs don't begin to happen
until next year, we haven't focused on them.   But they keep
sending me stuff for clearance that could foreclose some of the
kinds of options USDA is looking at.   For some reason, they are
very hot to trot on getting paper out to the world.
For example, they are already pushing to put in flyers exactly
what documentation people may have to bring to prove citizenship,
even as USDA is saying that it will probably allow recipients to
sign something attesting they are eligible.
I have talked to Brian Coyne about this, but I am not sure that
succeeded.   I hate to say we need another meeting.  Perhaps we can
meet with them right after (or before) our next subgroup meeting
on Tuesday at 3. We don't necessarily need our whole gang, but
Elena and Steve would be most helpful here.
I would propose this -- unless people think that we need a meeting
focused on the whole subject of interim verification with INS,
SSA, USDA, maybe HHS.
