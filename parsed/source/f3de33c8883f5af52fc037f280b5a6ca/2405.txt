TEXT:
Bruce:     I want to make sure that the VP is doing something public to try

to push the bill along (and so that there are no claims that he and POTUS

were AWOL if the bill flags this week).     I also, of course, do not want to

do anything provocative for our efforts.



What do you think of bringing in some groups to meet with him in the

Roosevelt Room on Thursday or Friday, and then having a pool spray at the

top where the VP just says,    'I hope the Senate will work hard to make as

much progess as soon as possible. '
