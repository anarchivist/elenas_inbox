I never saw Thurm letter -- did you, Cynthia?

Also, have we heard any more about Sharp and other Dems losing heart about
this change, as the unions charged on Friday?

I'm not aware of anything specific. McKinney wrote a rather contrite
letter to Kevin Thurm in response to Thurm's letter of late Feb. Also,
there has been talk of interagency meeting with some members of the Texas
delegation. But you all would know better what the status of that is.
