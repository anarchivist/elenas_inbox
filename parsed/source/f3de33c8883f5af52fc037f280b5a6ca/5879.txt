TEXT:
Scheduling is looking for events to do Monday and possibly Wednesday of
next week.  They don't want to announce another budget item, and would
prefer a values-type announcement. Chris Jennings has the announcement
for a kids outreach initiative, which sounds perfect, but I'm not positive
it will be ready in time.   If it can be ready, should I submit a proposal
on this? Are there other ideas we should propose? Let me know if there's
anything I can do to follow up on this. Thanks.
