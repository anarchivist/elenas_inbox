TEXT:
As you may have noticed, the President once again yesterday mentioned four
counties.  I think we need them to do a definitive count on this and send
the PResident a memo or something so he corrects this or doesn't say it.
I've got a reporter who's getting ready, I think, to write something about
this.

According to the Education Department, there are at least six school
districts where kids from at lest 1000 language backgrounds can be found.
These include:

1. New York City (which is 5 counties itself; I don't have a
county-by-county breakdown.

2.   Chicago

3.   Detroit

4.   Milwaukee

5.   Los Angeles

6.   Montgomery County, Maryland

This list is not exhaustive; the head of bilingual education started
calling around at our request, and stopped at 6.

I still don't know where the President got the idea that there are four
counties with over 100 languages spoken.  Barry, maybe you can pick four
of these as the ones that the President had in mind, and also indicate
that there are several others.

Let me know if we need to go back to Education for an exhaustive list.
