TEXT:
No one knows of a child care proposal to give tax deductions to businesses
operating child care centers at a loss.  Joan Lombardi still thinks he
must mean Kohl. Mark Mazur says that under general tax law, businesses
get a deduction if they operate anything at a loss, but this has nothing
to do with child care centers.
