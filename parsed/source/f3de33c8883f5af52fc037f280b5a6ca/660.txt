TEXT:
We're getting there but Eli is still not comfortable.

Right now we are looking at Marriot and UPS or Burger King and UPS as
co-chairs along with a small, minority company--probably Rachel's Bus
Compnay.  Eli is very uncomfortable with United right now because of the
current labor dispute. What do you think?

Further, we are trying to hone the mission statement. We want to stay away
from comitting to an exact number -- the President's number is all we need
-- but Eli wants something concrete and tough. What we have now is too
soft for Eli ...

We are reconvening tomorrow at 4:15 p.m. at which point a decision will be
made.  Eli would rather not do this now, but feels the President really
wants to go ahead.
