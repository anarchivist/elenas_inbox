HOUSE VOTE ON ANTI-GAY HEFLEY AMENDMENT TO OVERTURN CLINTON EXECUTIVE ORDER
BANNING JOB DISCRIMINATION EXPECTED TODAY

Vote For Hefley Amendment Is A Vote To Legalize Discrimination, Asserts HRC

WASHINGTON -- The House is scheduled to vote today on the Hefley Amendment
to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill which seeks to overturn
President Clinton's May 28th executive order banning workplace
discrimination based on sexual orientation. The passage of this bill would
go against public opinion which recent polls show is overwhelmingly in
favor of job protection for gay Americans, according to the Human Rights
Campaign.
        "This is a flagrant bid to placate religious political extremists
who have threatened to leave the GOP unless they adopt more strident
positions on social issues.  The Hefley Amendment is indicative of the
stranglehold the Far Right currently has over certain elements of the GOP,"
said HRC executive director Elizabeth Birch.
        "A vote for the Hefley Amendment is a vote for legalizing
discrimination, which most Americans adamantly oppose. Republicans,
Democrats, and independents in Congress do not want to add the official
stamp of approval for anti-gay workplace discrimination in federal
agencies," said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.
        The Hefley amendment, sponsored by Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO), is not
in line with public opinion. A new poll released by HRC and conducted by


the polling firm Penn, Schoen, and Berland shows 64 percent of Americans
said they are against Congress overturning the executive order, compared to
only 28 percent who support overturning the discrimination ban.
        A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last week reaffirms
the HRC findings with 72 percent of the American public supporting
President Clinton's Executive Order against anti-gay bias in federal
agencies.
        An April, 1997 poll conducted for the Human Rights Campaign by the
Tarrance Group, shows that eighty percent of the American public says that
homosexuals should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities.
        Before this executive order was issued, many federal agencies had
their own separate policies banning discrimination based on sexual
orientation. This often led to confusion amongst government workers as to
whether or not they were protected. Contrary to the claims of the GOP
leadership, this executive order helps clarify the law for government
workers by bringing uniformity to existing anti-discrimination policies
across the federal government.
        The order adds sexual orientation to the list of protected
categories for which discrimination is already prohibited, i.e., race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, handicap and age. In issuing the
order, Clinton noted that this policy does not add any new enforcement
rights, such as the ability of a civilian federal worker to appeal an
anti-gay job discrimination case before the Equal Employment Opportunity
commission.
          The Human Rights Campaign is the nation's largest national lesbian
and gay political organization, with members throughout the country,
effectively lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the
public to ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and
safe at home, at work, and in the community.
