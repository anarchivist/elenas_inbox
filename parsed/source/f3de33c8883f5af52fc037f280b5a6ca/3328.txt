TEXT:
I've been meaning to tell you that I'm never going to be able to do a veto
message on this, given the Climate stuff that has dropped into my lap.
However, I can provide a hard-copy and disk of last year's message for you
or whoever is going to draft this year's message.  I don't think there's
much urgency on this, since Hilley doesn't seem to think it's coming up
soon, but I wanted to tell you this so people wouldn't be looking at me
to produce a draft.   tds
