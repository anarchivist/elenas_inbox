TEXT:
That would probably be a reasonable back-up (at least in my view), but I
think Rahm, and Ann are aiming for something with a more direct holiday
tie-in -- e.g. lots of families will be taking long drives and going to
barbecues over the long weekend, so here is something to protect average
families ..

Do you think anything is doable in those other areas?   If not, we can
float the child support idea ...
