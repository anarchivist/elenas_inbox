     Cleveland school voucher program. The Administration is opposed to vouchers.
     Has this study caused you to reassess your views?

A.   No, for several reasons.

     First, the New York Times article is misleading. The "evaluation" findings it reports are
     not from the official, independent state evaluation being conducted by Indiana University,
     and whose first report is not scheduled to be released for several weeks.

     Second, this study actually focuses on students in only 2 of the 41 schools participating in
     the Cleveland voucher program -- only 15% of the students involved in the voucher
     program. These two schools are resource-intensive, run by avowed pro-voucher
     advocates, and are not typical of the other private schools participating in the program.

     Further, the study relies on questionable analysis techniques. For example, it uses
     questionable testing procedures and fails to take into acount the background or prior
     achievement of the voucher students.

     Third, our opposition to vouchers is based as much on what happens to students who do
     not participate as on what may happen to the few who do. The fact is that 90% of our
     students attend public schools, and our primary responsibility, especially with limited
     federal resources, is to make sure that the public schools they attend are among the best in
     the world. This means concentrating our time and money on raising academic standards,
     improving teaching, providing schools with technology and other up-to-date learning
     tools, and creating charter schools and other forms of choice within the public school
     system. It means holding schools accountable for the results they achieve -- something
     fundamentally impossible to do with private schools which are, by design, unaccountable
     to the public. Instead, vouchers drain financial resources and energy away from our most
     important task -- improving our public schools.
