EK:

As requested, reasons not to cut COPS, in order of most to least
defensible:

1.  $100 million is for a communications initiative strongly supported by
the VP;

2.   $76 million funds Brady records, the sex offender registry and DNA lab
improvements     all of which were originally in DOJ budget and cannot be
cut;

3. At least $200 million is needed simply to fund the popular earmarks
supported by Congress and the Administration (bulletproof vests, school
safety, Indian law enforcement, meth enforcement, DC initiative, Police
Corps, domestic violence ... not to mention a potential "hot spots" earmark
for the race initiative;

4.  $50 million is needed to fund retention waivers that are strongly
supported by the VP;

5.  $150 million is for prosecutors initiatives that have already been cut
from other parts of the budget (community prosecutors, juvie crime bill);

6.  $100 million is for the only sizable prevention increase in the
Justice budget; and

7.  $600 million is needed if we want to be able to fund a minimum of
10,000 cops per year.

TOTAL: $1.276 Billion
