TEXT:
Here's a bit of feedback from DOL on the calls they've made to Democratic
Governors staffs.  Chiles and O'Bannon agreed that the new draft -goes in
the wrong direction, and they were more comfortable with the original Shaw
draft.  They expressed extreme frustration that the Administration was not
being more helpful on this in general, and specifically that we were not
offering any alternative.
