TEXT:
On Friday Senator Lott rule 14nd the Coverdell bill ( which is pending in
the Labor Committee, and bans federal funding for programs which support
needle exchange either directly or indirectly ) which means that the bill
has been placed on the Senate calendar for consideration·but for the
Kennedy hold.

The Senate Democratic cloak room has notified the Kennedy staff that given
his hold on the bill freestanding he should be prepared for it to be
offered as an amendment to some other pending legislation. Labor Committee
Republicans, including Jeffords and Frist are probably inclined to be
helpful but will be looking for cues from the White House. The Kennedy
folks are also looking for cues from us.

Folks on the Hill are most interested in having Drs. Varmus and Satcher
speak to Jeffords, Frist and others regarding the issue. I also spoke to
Kevin Thurm about this and he, too, was looking for some direction on how
to proceed.

Do we happen to have any cues give them, by chance?

Thanks.
