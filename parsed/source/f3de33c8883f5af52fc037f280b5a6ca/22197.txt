PRESIDENT CLINTON AND VICE PRESIDENT GORE:


A HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO PRESERVING OUR LANDS
January 12, 1999

Today, at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., President Clinton and
Vice President Gore announce a $1 billion Lands Legacy Initiative -- the
largest one-year investment ever in the protection of AmericaO,s land
resources. This FY 2000 budget proposal -- a 125-percent increase over FY 1999
-- expands federal efforts to save AmericaO,s natural treasures and provides
significant new resources to states and communities to protect local green
spaces. To sustain these efforts in the new century, the President commits to
work with Congress to create a permanent funding stream beginning in FY 2001.
In addition, the President calls on Congress to extend permanent wilderness
protection to more than 5 million acres within 17 national parks and monuments.
This landmark initiative charts a new conservation vision for the 21st century,
preserving irreplaceable pieces of our natural legacy within easy reach of
every citizen.

Saving AmericaO,s Natural Treasures. At the start of this century, President
Theodore Roosevelt called on Americans to save the best of our natural
endowment for all time. His legacy is seen across the country, in our parks,
our forests, and our wildlife refuges. President Clinton has continued to
fulfill this vision by protecting Yellowstone Park from mining, creating a 1.7
million-acre national monument in UtahO,s spectacular red-rock country, and
forging a historic agreement to save ancient California redwoods. The Lands
Legacy Initiative expands these efforts with $442 million for federal land
acquisitions. Priorities include:

 - Mojave Desert - Acquiring 450,000 acres within and around Mojave and Joshua
Tree National Parks.
 - New England Forests - Acquiring additional land within national forests and
wildlife refuges in Maine,                      Vermont, New Hampshire and New
York.
 - Everglades - Acquiring lands critical to ongoing federal-state restoration
efforts.
 - Lewis and Clark Trail - Protecting the explorersO, historic route along the
Missouri River.
 - Civil War Battlefields - Acquiring lands within Gettysburg, Antietam and
other battlegrounds.

Protecting our Parks. In addition, the President is calling on Congress to
grant permanent wilderness protection to over 5 million acres within the
backcouritry.of Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Glacier, Great Smoky Mountains,
Cumberland Gap and 12 other national parks and monuments, giving these lands
the highest level of federal protection available.

A Conservation Vision for the 21st Century. A new century poses new
conservation challenges.
Beyond saving AmericaO,s "crown jewels," we must work as well to preserve
natural wonders in our very backyards that grow scarcer every day. Protecting
local green spaces helps improve air and water quality, sustain wildlife,
provide families with places to play and relax, and make our communities more
livable. Lands Legacy, to be coordinated with the Livability Agenda announced
yesterday by Vice President Gore, provides $588 million to state and local
governments, private land trusts, and other nonprofit groups for:

Land Acquisition Grants - $150 million in matching grants for land or easements
for urban parks, greenways, outdoor recreation, wetlands, and wildlife habitat.
Planning Grants and Loans - $50 million in matching grants for open space
planning, and $10 million to support $50 million in low-interest loans to rural
areas for "smart growth" planning and development.


Farmland Protection - $50 million for easements on threatened farmland and open
space.
Urban Parks and Forests - $40 million to maintain and expand urban and
community forests, and $4 million to renovate parks in distressed urban
neighborhoods.
Forest and wildlife Protection - $50 million for easements to protect critical
forest habitat, and $80 million for habitat conservation plans to protect
endangered species.

Protecting our Oceans and Coasts. Lands Legacy includes funds for federal and
state efforts to protect ocean and coastal resources: $29 million to expand and
protect national marine sanctuaries; $90 million to states to protect and
restore coastlands; $19 million to states for estuary protections; and $45
million to restore coral reefs, fisheries and marine habitats.
