TEXT:
The DOJ Conference on Juvenile Justice is being held at the Georgetown
University Conference Center.  Today, Stephanie Streett asked me to try to
move it to DOJ b/c some folks that would send a better message, but
unfortunately it is not possible. DOJ would lose the $11,000 they have
already paid the contractors for the event.  Scheduling has agreed to keep
the President scheduled to speak at G'town, but I wanted you to know b/c
earlier today Erskine was told by Stephanie and Ann Lewis that the
conference was going to be moved to DOJ.

FYI: Rahm, Jose, Leanne and me have always thought it is fine to do the
event at Georgetown. Hope you agree.
