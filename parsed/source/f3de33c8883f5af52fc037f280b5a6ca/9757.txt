  TEXT:
  We are looking to nail down a date for the 1999 State of the Union
  speech.  The dates for previous State of the Union addresses were:

  Tuesday,   January 25,   1994
  Tuesday,   January 24,   1995
  Tuesday,   January 23,   1996
  Tuesday,   February 4,   1997
  Tuesday,   January 27,   1998

  The President is confirmed to greet the Pope on his arrival in St. Louis
  on Tuesday, January 26, and the Vice President has been asked to greet the
  Pope on his departure on Wednesday, January 27.

  Therefore, we would like to look at the following dates as options for
  this year's State of the Union address:

  Tuesday, February 2, 1999
  OR
  Wednesday, February 3, 1999

  Please note that the annual National Prayer Breakfast on Capitol Hill will
  take place the morning of Thursday, February 4, 1999.

  PLEASE EMAIL KARIN KULLMAN WITH ANY COMMENTS OR CONFLICTS WITH THIS DATEBY
  COB TODAY.
