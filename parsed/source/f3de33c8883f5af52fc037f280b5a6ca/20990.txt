ATTENTION SENIOR STAFF!

In an effort to let you know what your colleagues are saying "on the air",
the White House Press Office has created a "Listen-In" Line for radio
interviews.  Radio Outreach is an important (an easy) way to get our
message out there, and listening to interviews is the best way to learn
how to deal with radio hosts!

The Radio Office will update the line as interviews occur and we will
e-mail you when something new is available. We encourage you to call in!
