TEXT:
Here is a draft of the veto letter. I've sent a copy to ED for quick
comments, to make sure I haven't screwed anything up.

A couple of points, small and large:

1.  I dont' know who we send the letter to--Gingrich, Goodling/Jeffords
and ranking members?

2. You know I'm not big on process, but it seems appropriate to get OMB
and Leg Affairs into this.  will staffing out the letter accomplish this,
or is there some other steps I should take?

3. There are some key items in or about the overall Higher Education Act
that need to be sorted out before we send this letter. Chief among them:
We expect an anti-affirmative action amendment from Riggs when this bill
reaches the floor.   Does a veto threat on this bill at this point change
the dynamics on the affirmative action vote, by giving people a "free"
vote since the will think the bill will be vetoed?
The bill as reported out by committee includes our High Hopes mentoring
initiative--passed over Goodling's objections,   POTUS and others should be
aware of this before sending the letter.
The bill adopted the Administration's proposal to reduce interest rates on
student loans, but also increased profits to banks at a cost of $2.7
billion (I think over 5 years).   This is one of the most hotly contested
items in the bill--we are strongly opposed to the committee's move on
this.   I didn't want to cloud this particular letter up with additional
issues, so I put in a general sentence about "reservations about a number
of provisions in the bill" to give us room to come back to this later.
Others may see this differently.
There is also another major higher education issue we are fighting with
the R's about- regarding accountability provisions and the treatment of
guarantee agencies in the student loan program. As on the above-issue, my
concern is that we not -look like we are ignoring central issues to the
student financial aid programs which are at the heart of this bill.   I
think we can address this concern through statements and other actions
outside this letter, but everyone needs to be on board on that approach.

4.  I have been working very closely with the National Board staff over
the past few days, and am scheduled to meet with them at 3:30 today.  They
have the best handle on a legislative strategy.  I would like to talk this
step through with them before we act.

In general, their sense of things is that (1) they don't want a floor vote
in the House because they don't have enough support to win and don't want
a recorded vote; (2) their conversations with Jeffords and others on the

"
    Senate comm·ittee lead them to believe they will not face a similar move in
    mark-up next week, though could when the bill comes to the floor; (3) they
    would in general prefer to keep things low key until they get through
    Senate mark-up, and would probably prefer saber-rattling from the White
    House after that point; (4) Jim Hunt is still the key guy for the Board,
    would love the President's support in this fight, and will gladly take it
    whenever it comes. ==================== ATTACHMENT    l ====================

     DRAFT:

     Dear_ _ __

             Last week when the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee reported
     out the Higher Education Act, it included a provision that prohibited continued federal support
     for the vital work of National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. The National Board
     is a nonprofit, nonpartisan and nongovernmental body devoted to strengthening teaching by
     developing rigorous professional standards. The Board has been at the forefront of bipartisan
     efforts at the national and state level to strengthen teaching in America, and has received
     bipartisan support in the Congress and in two Administrations.

             The recently released results of the Third International Math and Science Study confirm
     that one of the most important steps the nation can take to improve student achievement is to
     strengthen teaching. The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an essential
     tool for our nation's efforts. By defining standards of excellence for experienced teachers, the
     National Board helps to focus and upgrade teacher training, recognize and reward outstanding
     teachers, and keep our best teachers in the classroom where they are needed the most. National
     Board certification helps our best teachers test themselves against the toughest standards for
     teaching ever developed.

            By ending federal support for the Board's research and development, the House
     Committee action jeopardizes the scheduled completion of the development of professional
     standards within the next 3 years. This is the wrong step to take at precisely the time when we
     must work to help every school in America have at least one board-certified master teacher who
     can help lead the effort to strengthen teaching throughout the school.

             The Office of Management and Budget is coordinating a review of the Higher Education
     Act as reported by the Committee. I have serious reservations about a number of the bill's
     provisions, but I am very clear now that the provision ending funding for the work of the
     National Board is unacceptable. It will move our efforts to improve teaching backward when
     we must instead move forward more rapidly. It is early in the legislative process for the Higher
     Education Act, and there is still time to correct this unfortunate step. However, if the Higher
     Education Act eliminates continuing support for the National Board for Professional Teaching
     Standards when it reaches by desk, I will veto that bill.


     Sincerely,

                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                          HeX-Dump Conversion
