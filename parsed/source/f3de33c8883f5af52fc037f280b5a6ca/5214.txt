  Nice job; just a few comments.    Michael says OK by him.

  on page 4, the parenthetical sentence at the end of the first paragraph
  says that DOJ can handle within base any new workload in 1999 created by
  the extension of the Federal hate crimes statute to other classes (e.g.,
  gender). The sentence goes on to say that the DOJ 1999 budget request
  therefore does not include any funds for this purpose.     This may be
  technically incorrect since the budget request was prepared before the
  legislation was approved.    It's a small issue, but it might be better just
  to say that "DOJ is not requesting any funds in 1999 to implement the
  legislation."
  also on page 4, the discussion about the new FBI agents says "30 agents
  and prosecutors" and $13 million. The FBI's 1999 request includes 130
  positions (65 of which are agents) and $12.5 million for hate crimes/civil
  rights activities. There is also another 6 positions (1 agent) for the
  headquarters Civil Rights Analytical Center.     I cannot track the number
  in the memo. Also, I wonder about the advisability of even mentioning a
  specific number as opposed to "we will assign whatever resources are
  necessary to implement an enhanced program"
  Do we need to tell the President the number of rape cases so he has some
  perspective of the potential impact of the legislation?
  page 3--"Satellite site's" Is a word(s) missing at the end? e.g.,
  " ... Board are participants in ... "
            Also on page 3, end of first paragraph on policy announcements--~s
  period missing?

  Thanks again for chance to review.     I know Michael was pleased.
