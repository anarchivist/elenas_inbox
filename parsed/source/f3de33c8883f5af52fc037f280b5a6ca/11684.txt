TEXT:
I love this amendment.   Much stronger than anything I proposed.


"The House Banking Committee today resumed its markup of HR10, Financial
Modernization. Due to last-minute acrimony, the committee failed to
complete markup of Title I, and will resume tomorrow at lOam. The
amendments that passed are:

#29 Sanders, Lee, Schakowsky (amended by Leach) -- Prohibits ATM
surcharge fee unless fees are listed on the machine and the customer can
opt out during the transaction.  Also requires a GAO study of ATM fees."
