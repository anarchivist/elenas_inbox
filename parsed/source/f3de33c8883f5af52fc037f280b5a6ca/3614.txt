TEXT:
HHS may want to raise the bucket as part of the technicals discussion Ron
wants to have.  Here's the story: for many months, HHS could only see
their way clear to a partial fix of the bucket.  Just as we were about to
give up on this, Clay Shaw wrote a letter saying congressional intent was
a lOO% fix of the bucket. This caused HHS to go back to the drawing board
(for months).  They now see a way to do a lOO% fix, but their legal theory
conflicts with OMB counsel's theory, and for the moment it's stuck there.

So HHS wants to throw into the technical mix the possibility that Congress
could clarify this issue, and they may raise it at our conference call
tomorrow. OMB doesn't disagree.   I don't see any downside, other than if
we have to use a chit for it. But Haskins is on our side here, so it may
not use a chit.
