      TEXT:
      Below are the topics for Wednesday's press conference. I have been told
      Sylvia Mathews mentioned in the morning meetings today that it is
      essential that we get the guidance to the President in a timely fashion.
      I'd appreciate if I could get the Q&A's by 10:00am tomorrow. As always,
      the Q&As should be formated as though the President is actually being
      asked and answering the question. Thank you for your help.
