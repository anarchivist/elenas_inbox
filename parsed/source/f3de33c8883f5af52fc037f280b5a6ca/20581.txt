TEXT:
Liz Shogren is working on a long-term piece on our use of executive
actions (such as those we're featuring this week) to implement policy.
She's looking for some technical details, but what she really wants to do
is take some examples of what we've done, look at what we did, a bit on
how we did it, what the impact was, and how we keep track of that impact.

Rahrn, Bruce, Elena -- You're probably in the best position to decide what
examples I want to cite to her that tell the story best. Let's talk.
