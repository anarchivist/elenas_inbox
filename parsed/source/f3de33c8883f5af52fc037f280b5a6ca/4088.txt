TEXT:
As the temporary smokes guy I report: Barry T. talked about the Florida
settlement in the briefing this a.m., CNN described us as supporting the
state by state settlement as a way of helping lead to a national
deal ... They also said the administration was taing a "bit of a go slow"
approach on recommendaitons to the POTUS and he'd get them sometime after
he returns ...
