TEXT:
CEQ has been working with DOJ and OMB to prepare an announcement of an
environmental crimes initiative. Attached is a draft Presidential directive to
the Attorney General for inclusion in the announcement.
The directive focusses on the communities right to know, restitution, and help
from the FBI for local law enforcement.
I think that DOJ is likely to be of the view that a directive is unnecessary,
however I believe that a directive highlights the President's personal
commitment to actions that will protect communities from environmental harm.

Memorandum on Protecting Communities from Environmental Crimes
"

    July xx, 1996
    Memorandum for the Attorney General
    Subject:    protecting Communities from Environmental Crimes
    PRINTER FONT 12 POINT ROMAN
                  -      -
           We have made tremendous progress over the last twenty
    o
    -five
    years in protecting public health and the environment from toxics
    and other pollution.   Most Americans and most companies do all
    they can to protect our environment. Yet a few bad actors still
    endanger families, communities and law enforcement officers by
    violating environmental laws.
            When toxic wastes are transported and dumped illegally the
    harm can extend to police officers, fire fighters, paramedics,
    and to families who live next door.   Pollution illegally dumped
    into a river can contaminate the drinking water of communities
    downstream, and poll ute the fish that people eat from the river.
    In the last few years several spills have devastated the wildlife
    in rivers across America.   Many of these environmental insults
    can persist for months and years-
    o
    - threatening communi ties,
    undermining family security and reducing the value of
    neighborhood homes.

            For too long communities have not had the right to know when
    environmental laws are violated.  People want to know where toxic
    wastes have been found-
    o
    -and what is being done to hold these
    criminals accountable for the damage they have done.
            Law enforcetnent and prosecutors across the country need
    every tool we can give them to protect their communities from
    environmental insul t -
    o
    -large or small. Protecting the environment
    and enforcing our itnportant environmental laws can be the
    province of every local prosecutor. We can do more for
    communities, local law enforcement and victims of environmental
    crimes.
            That is why I am directing you to take a number of important
    measures that will improve protection for communities from
    environmental offenders.
            First, I want you to strengthen the protection for
    communities when the federal government undertakes prosecution of
    environmental cases.    Communities have a right to know about
    environmental violations near their homes, and violators need to

    be held accountable for the harm they have done. Accordingly, I
    am directing you to require that all Assistant United States
    Attorneys seek community notification of environmental violations
    in all environmental prosecutions.
            Second, you should take steps to make victims of
    environmental crimes whole.  In particular, restitution of
    environmental harm should be sought whenever it is in the public
    interest.
            Finally, I want you to work with state and local officials
    -- governors, attorneys general, legislators, district attorneys,
    and judges    to ensure that the federal government is doing
    everything it can to help local officials prosecute environmental
"   /.'



     violators.  In particular you should determine how the FBI can
     provide additional training to law enforcement officials on the
     federal laws and resources available to protect the health and
     environment of America's communities.
             To achieve these objectives, I expect you to identify
     funding where and when appropriate.   You should report to me in
     writing byb December I, 1996 on the specific steps you will take
     to develop this policy.
                                                              William J. Clinton
