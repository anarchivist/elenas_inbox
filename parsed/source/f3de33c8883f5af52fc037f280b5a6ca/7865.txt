TEXT:
We are trying to push for the after-school event for June 11th. Our
understanding is that it is tentavely scheduled for the President, and set
for the First Lady.    Because of the tightness of the schedule for June,
they want to leave it ,as an option for the President.  However, this event
-- which is both the grants announcement and the release of a new report
showing how after-school programs prevent crime and help kids learn --
responds to the President's wish to do an after-school event, and sets us
up for the appropriations process we are entering.   We are basically
trying to get a commitment by the President for the 11th because Ed is
concerned that we can't push the grants announcement much later.

Thanks very much--
