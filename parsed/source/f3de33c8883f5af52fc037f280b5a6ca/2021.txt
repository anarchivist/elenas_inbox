TEXT:
On Friday, the First Lady is going to recognize 12 organizations making a
difference in preventing teen pregnancy.  These groups were chosen by the
National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy as their first honorees.   One
honoree is Gloria Feldt, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of
America.

Elena -- should we have a Q&A for the First Lady and the press office on
partial birth abortion?
