TEXT:
I talked to counsel's office, and here's the story:. we are free to talk
to Treasury's Office of Tax Policy about this matter, but not to the IRS.

I am trying to clarify whether the document the IRS plans to issue (a
notice) is techn~cally a rulemaking.  If it is NOT rulemaking, there are
no restrictions on us (other than not talking to the IRS).  If it IS
ru1emaking, we are still free to talk to Tax Policy, but if I am trying to
influence this substantively, I need your or Bruce's permission to do so
and I need to involve OIRA.

In any case, it means we are free to weigh in on this. So now we have to
figure out what to do substantively. We should talk on Wednesday.
