                                       March 9, 1998

Background:

         Since the 1930s, tobacco prices have been supported and stabilized by the federal
government's commodity support program. The tobacco program operates through a
combination of marketing quotas, which limit supply, and no-net-cost tobacco loans, which help
to balance supply with demand. There are two main types oftobacco, Flue-cured and Burley.
Flue-cured is common in North Carolina, Burley is more popular in Kentucky.

         The settlement agreement with the Attorneys General did not outline a plan to
compensate farmers for the negative effects of diminished domestic tobacco sales that might
result from comprehensive legislation. The President, however, made protecting tobacco
farmers and their communities one of the five key elements of his plan for comprehensive
tobacco legislation.


Status in Congress:

        Thus far, three types of legislative approaches have been discussed. First, Senator Lugar
has proposed legislation that would quickly "buy-out" quota owners from the governmental
system at approximately $8 a pound. In Senator Lugar's plan, tobacco prices would then be
subject to the free market. Second, Senator Ford has proposed legislation that would maintain
the current quota system. However, if prices decline Senator Ford would require the
government to compensate farmers for the difference between the prices farmers would have
enjoyed without legislation and the diminished prices they may experience -- up to a total of up
to $8 per pound. Senator Ford's bill also includes approximately a $500 million a year
transistion fund for communities. Finally, Senator Robb has legislation that would combine
elements of both pieces oflegislation. Senator Robb plans on buying-out farmers, but replacing
the quota system with a production control system based on licenses. Unlike quotas, licenses
would be given only to those who actually grew tobacco and could not be bought or rented.

         No consensus has yet emerged in the tobacco growing community as to which legislation
is preferred. Senator Ford's proposal, the LEAF Act, appeals most to Burley growers like
those in Kentucky who have small farms and want to continue the quota program. Senator
Robb's approach has gained some support from Flue-cure<i farmers (based mainly in North
Carolina and Virginia) who believe the buy-out and license system better fits more
capital-intensive Flue-cured production. Senator Lugar's approach has some appeal to
conservative farmers but has not attracted widespread support, and even those tobacco-state
senators like McCol1I!ell who may philosophically favor this approach likely would not come out
for it publicly.

      Senators Ford and Robb have discussed a compromise bill which would treat Flue-cured
and Burley tobacco differently. Under this approach, Flue-cured growers would be bought-out




          and remaining growers would use a license system like that supported by Senator Robb, Burley
          growers would remain subject to the quota system as favored by Senator Ford in the LEAF Act.
          The Administration has encouraged their efforts at compromise. Many members of the House are
          looking to Ford and Robb for a workable compromise which could then be introduced by a
          tobacco state coalition in the House. The major issue separating Ford and Robb at this point is
          Robb's belief that there should be a decrease in the legislatively-set price of Flue-cured tobacco
          so it can be more competitive internationally. Senator Ford has opposed this, and the
          Administration has expressed concern to Robb's staff that decreasing the price of tobacco, no
          matter how small its effect on the price of cigarettes, is likely not compatible with comprehensive
          tobacco legislation. Senators Helms and Faircloth originally saw Senator Ford's bill as a useful
        . block in place of Senator Lugar's bill, and Ford attracted their initial support along with that of 4
          other Republican co-sponsors. Senator Ford continues to work with Helms and Faircloth in
          crafting a bill that can obtain bipartisan support.
