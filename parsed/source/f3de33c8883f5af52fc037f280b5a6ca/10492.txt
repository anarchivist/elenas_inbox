                     COMBATING THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE

    SUMMARY                                     .'


    President Clinton's FY2000 budget will include $25 million for a new CDC initiative to control
    the spread of infectious diseases, This 31 percent increase over last year's funding level is the
    single largest increase in CDC funds dedicated to this increasing public health problem. The new
    initiative will fund new disease surveillance and rapid response activities, a national educational
    campaign to educate clinicians and the public about the consequences of inappropriate antibiotic
    use, and new research that identifies disease risk factors and creates diagnostic tests that allow
    for the immediate identification ofthese diseases in a clinical setting.

    Once expected to be eliminated, infectious diseases remain as one of the leading causes of death
    in the United States. The long term use and misuse of antibiotics have caused many
    microorganisms to adapt to these drugs, creating 'superbugs' that render current treatments
    ineffective. In addition, the emergence of new infectious diseases, such as the virulent strains of
    influenza identified in Hong Kong last year, pose a serious threat. Approximately one out of
    every six domestic health care dollars are spent on infectious diseases, and infectious
    complications in hospital settings result in an estimated $20 billion in excess health care costs.
    Without additional resources, public health agencies will be unable to meet this challenge.

    BACKGROUND

    Drug resistance causes diseases that we thought conquered to reemerge in stronger, more
    virulent forms (superbugs). A number of diseases once thought to be under control, such as
    cholera, malaria, and tuberculosis, have begun to increase and spread to new regions. The long
    term use and misuse of antibiotics have caused many microorganisms to adapt to these drugs,
    creating 'superbugs' that render current treatments ineffective. In recent years, multi drug
    resistant tuberculosis and drug resistant pneurilococcal infections (the most common cause of
    middle ear infections in children and pneumonia in the elderly) have become common. These
    infections result in longer hospital stays, rising health care costs, and increasing death rates.

    Increasing incidence of new infectious diseases. Between 1973 and 1995, more than thirty
    newly emerging infectious diseases were identified, including AIDS, toxic shock syndrome,
    Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The threat of an
    infleunza pandemic last year in Hong Kong, the recent recognition of the the huge health burden
    associated with hepatitis C, and the emergence of listeriosis over the past few weeks all remind
    us of the ongoing threat and burden that infectious diseases pose to our health and health care
    costs.

    There are substantial costs associated with the spread of infectious diseases.

           Infectious diseases have enormous health consequences. Only 10 years after it was
           discovered, AIDS became the most common cause of death in young adults in the United
           States. Present estimates suggest that one out of every 65 Americans are infected with


                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex.Dwnp Conversion
        cause of liver transplantationand in the next several years, the number of deaths from
        hepatitis C in the United States will surpass those from AIDS. In addition, 60 million
        unnecessary prescriptions are written every year for childhood viral infections that do not
        respond to antibiotics, making several common childhood diseases, including ear
        infections, extremely difficult to treat. This unnecessary use of antibiotics results in
        increased illnesses and deaths, because it reduces our ability to effectively treat the
        individual, their families, and the community at large.

        Infectious diseases contribute substantially to the escalating costs of health care.
        Approximately one out of every six domestic health care dollars are spent on infectious
        diseases, which account for 25 percent of all physician visits and constitute the most
        common reason for outpatient visits in the country. In addition, antimicrobial agents are
        the second most frequently prescribed class of drugs in the United States. Infectious
        complications in hospital settings result in an estimated $20 billion in excess health care
        costs.

 Emerging infections attack our most vulnerable populations. Emerging infections are
 particularly serious in people with lowered immunity, a population that includes those infected
 with HIV or receiving immunosuppressive therapy for cancer or organ transplantation. Children
 are also vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases; for instance, the 11 million children enrolled
 in day care programs are at a substantially increased risk of contracting an infectious disease,
 such as hepatitis A, acute respiratory illnesses, or middle ear infections.

  Without additional resources, public health agencies will be unable to meet this new
. challenge. Because of under-investments in State and local health departments, some public
  health departments do not have the laboratory and communication capabilities to rapidly detect
  and report newly emerging and resistant infectious diseases in an effective manner. In addition,
  technologic advances, evolving priorities, and categorical funding have led health departments to
  build multiple, independent data collection systems to service specific program areas. These
  costly inefficiencies leave critical gaps and compromise the quality of information used for
  public health action. Communication between public health entities is also severely
  compromised. In a recent test, the CDC could not contact nearly half of local public health
  departments within 24 hours.                                                       .

 NEW PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT INFECTIOUS DISEASE

 New disease surveillance and rapid response activities. Like early waming systems that detect
 threats to national security, surveillance with appropriate laboratory support is a critical element
 in the defense against these diseases. CDC work with State and local health agencies to establish
 a new electronic disease surveillance network to facilitate the timely transmission of information
 from reporting physicians and health facilities to State health departments. CDC will also
 enhance aspects of its currently operating surveillance system by increasing the number of active
 surveillance sites and sentinel provider networks and increasing the range of activities they
 conduct to include local investigations, education, and focused disease monitoring.

disease cases that signal the beginning of an outbreak are detected rapidly and that disease
outbreak information is used for immediate public health action. The information collected
through these new surveillance activities can be used to educate physicians about a common
bacterial pattern of resistance, or which strain of influenza is circulating amongst their patients,
reSUlting in patients receiving more appropriate care; for example, physicians will know which
type of bacterium are resistant to antibiotics and prescribe a more effective course of treatment.
In addition, an understanding of which viral strains are common this flu season allows health
care professionals to plan ahead for next year's treatment needs, designing vaccines that can
accurately target the currently circulating strain.

Prevention and education strategies to control the spread of infectious diseases. Studies
have shown that reductions in inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can lead to declines in
antibiotic resistance. CDC will invest in research to determine which health education methods
work most effectively to communicate with both providers and patients on the issue of antibiotic
resistance. The agency will then, together with other Federal agencies such as FDA and Nlli, will
work with private sector partners, including health plans, business coalitions, and professional
organizations to launch a national education campaign to educate clinicians and the public about
the consequences of inappropriate antibiotic use.

Using applied research to improve the public health. As disease strains develop resistance to
current drug therapies and as new ones emerge, CDC will initiate studies to determine the risk
factors for these diseases, such as leisure time activities, sites of exposure, or occupation. This
information will be used to educate providers about the nature of these reemerging or new
diseases and will allow them to provide the most effective course oftreatment to their patients. In
addition, CDC will create new diagnostic tests to that allow physicians to immediately identify
new disease strains in a clinical setting. This information will both ensure the most appropriate
course of treatment for the patient and provide health care professionals and epidemiologists
nationwide with valuable information about the nature of the infections' spread.
