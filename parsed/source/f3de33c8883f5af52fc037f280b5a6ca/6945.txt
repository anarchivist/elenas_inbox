TEXT:
Next Steps with McCain and Hollings
Have either of you spoken to John or Ivan about next steps?

On technical amendments, you may want to ask them if they   need anything
more from us -- we sent them technicals on Tuesday (which   they didn't
incorporate into the package handed out -- Ivan indicated   they were too
rushed), and yesterday they said they would probably need   our help on the
final price language.

There are several policy issues they've indicated that they'd like to work
on before the floor -- perhaps for a managers' amendment?   They are:

        International .issues (they want a Tuesday am mtg with us,
Hollings, Ford, & Wyden staff)
        Licensing/Anti-smuggling -- (McCain staff told me they'd like to
discuss post-markup)

And then there are several areas where our agencies would like to push for
changes:
         Constitutional issues    in particular, to urge them to strip the
lobbying ban
         Liability -- DOJ says the provisions are so poorly drafted as to
be nearly meaningless
         Penalties -- there are various technical changes Gruber has in mind

Talking Points and Q&A
I have asked the agencies to produce our best talking points and Q&A on
the following topics:
         Penalties
         Price/Youth Smoking Estimates
         ETS
        Antitrust
         Bankruptcy
         Smuggling/Black Market

Scoring
I just sent Cathy a note about having a meeting on this tomorrow.     I
assume its us, Josh, and Gruber?
