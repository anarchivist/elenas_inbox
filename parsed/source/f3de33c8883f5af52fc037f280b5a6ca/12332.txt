TEXT:
I'm happy to pull that group together but frankly, I'm more concerned that
we get to them on public charge and/or INS naturalization before NACARA
parity. Which issue do you all think is more urgent.   I'm not sure we
should load up our meeting too much and discuss all these issues.  Please
advise.

Subject: Parity Legislative Proposal- State Dept. rationale

Scott Busby received a draft of the State Dept. rationale for a broad
parity legislative proposal. We would like to pull a meeting together of
the group that has been meeting on this issue that you have convened in
the past to discuss the State Dept. paper and to prepare a deputy level
meeting to decide this issue.    Do you want to schedule or would like me
to schedule the meeting?

Please advise.

Thanks.
