TEXT:
Due to the House Vote, we thought we should try to get folks together to
see about who should say something about this and exactly what should be
said. Ann has offered up her office for 9:30am Thurs morning.    If someone
else besides you should be included, please pass this e-mail on.   Let
Tania or me know if this time does not work for you.  thanks
