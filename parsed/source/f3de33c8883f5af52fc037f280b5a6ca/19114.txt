          Q:   What is your current position on needle exchange?

          A:   Before authorizing the release of any Federal funds for needle exchange programs, the
               law requires the HHS Secretary to make two determinations: First is determining that
               needle exchange programs are effective in preventing HIV; and the second is finding that
               needle exchange programs do not increase drug use. Last year, Secretary Shalala
               released a report that concluded that needle exchange programs have proved effective at
               reducing HIV. HHS is still in the process of determining whether or not they increase
               drug use.


          Q:   What is your reaction to the fact that your Drug Czar and your AIDS Czar hold
               opposing views on this issue? How will you resolve these tensions in your
               Administration?

          A:   Clearly both General McCaffery and Sandy Thurman have strong feelings on these issues.
                They do, however, both share the goal of reducing the incidence of HIV and reducing the
               incidence of drug use. We will work carefully with them and others within the
               Administration to develop a process that reduces the incidence of HIV without increasing
               drug use.
