TEXT:
Q.      Can you say any more about the tobacco settlement now that your
staff have had more time to review it?

A.       The task force reviewing the settlement -- led by Secretary
Shalala and Bruce Reed -- has not yet finished its work or made
recommendations to me.   I've reached a final conclusion on only one part
of the" settlement: the requirement that the FDA make a finding about black
markets before mandating any product change.   That is an unreasonable
requirement, which will too greatly limit the FDA's ability to make
tobacco products safer or less addictive. The task force is making good
progress in reviewing the rest of the proposed settlement and seeing how
we can move forward to protect the health of our children.   I look forward
to their report.

Q.      The industry has been winning recent battles in Congress.
Efforts to fully fund FDA's tobacco program have failed in both the House
and Senate, and a provision in the tax bill allowing industry to count the
new tobacco tax as a credit against its settlement payments. Doesn't this
show that the industry will get its way in Congress on any legislation
and, if so, why pursue a settlement?

A.      First, I urge Congress to fully fund FDA's tobacco appropriation
   those funds will be used to reduce youth access.   As to the tobacco
tax offset provision, it was an industry action of extraordinary bad faith
that we will keep it in mind as we consider the settlement proposal.
