Per DOT, the following is the tort reform provision in the Coast Guard
reauthorization:

(1) retained the provision that allowed cruise lines to assert the medical
malpractice caps of foreign countries in which an injured passenger is treated;

(2) retained the provision which limits passenger suits for pain and suffering
to that related to physical injury only.  This directly impacts rape victims
who are not physically injured in addition to the rape. A court challenge is
expected to determine if rape itself falls under this provision.

(3) dropped the provision which would have limited for seamen's ability to sue
in US courts for injuries. This provision was opposed by both the maritime
unions and trial lawyers.
