TEXT:
Elena, Christa probably mentioned to you that Phil Caplan suggested that
we submit background material for the President as "weekend reading" and
submit everything (i.e. overview memo and materials) at once.  I have the
3 background reports, and am working on the overview memo, which will
require our coming to closure on some agenda items (and announcements for
the 2nd panel) before it can be completed.
