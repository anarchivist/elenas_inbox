Transcript from NPR interview

   Q    So, if you don't get the tobacco settlement, you'll
cut elsewhere?

             THE PRESIDENT:  If I don't get -- in other words, if we
don't get the tobacco settlement, we'll either have to cut the size
of the child care initiative or cut elsewhere, or do something else,
because I will not just, on my own, get up and propose that we spend
the proposed settlement, or part of it, on these programs.  I think
they are terribly important, but right now we've got other fish to
fry.  And we've got to make sure -- the most important thing is to
keep this economy growing, to keep disciplined, to keep strong, to do
what makes sense.  And that's what has gotten us here, five hard
years of that, and we don't want to forget that.

             So we do have new spending in our programs, but it's new
spending within a context of fiscal discipline.  It's new discipline
with the smallest federal government since Kennedy was President and
the size of it continuing to go down.
