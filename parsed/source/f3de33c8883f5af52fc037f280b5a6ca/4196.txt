Welcome back!   I trust you are tan, rested, and ready.   3 items:

1. Tobacco:   I want to invite you to a meeting I am having tomorrow at
lOam in 211 with FTC's Jodie Bernstein, Director of the Bureau of Consumer
Protection, and Lee Peeler, with the Bureau's Division of Advertising
Practices, to discuss the tobacco settlement, particularly the anti-trust
provisions.  I have also invited HHS. Should I invite anyone else?
Justice?

2. Food Safety:   I need your advice and help with an impasse with Sally
Katzen on FDA food safety enforcement legislation.    At my request, after
clearing it with Bruce, DPC is insisting on changes before the White House
sends up the FDA bill. The USDA bill was already sent.    Issues with
Justice prevented the two bills from being sent together.   Please call me.

3. Air Bags: We are being heavily lobbied to meet with a broad coalition
of outside groups opposed to NHTSA's proposed rule.  I want to make sure I
follow the rules about White House meetings concerning pending regulatory
matters. Please call me.
