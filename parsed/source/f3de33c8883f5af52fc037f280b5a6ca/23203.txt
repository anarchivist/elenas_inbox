          I spoke with Chuck Loveless today and this is what we agreed the event
          would be:

          10:40 am                 arrival at Omni Shoreham Hotel
          10:45 am - 10:55 am      Meet and Greet w/20 leadership/escort committee
          11:00 am - 11:50 am      Speech - Open Press - 350 guests

          He mentioned that the group would be lobbying on the hill regarding Saving
          Social Security and Medicare and would like Potus to speak about these
          issues.

          Let me know if you have any concerns.      Thanks.
