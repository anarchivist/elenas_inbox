Subject: NC5360: FRC blasts Phelps

    WASHINGTON, Nov. 10 /PRNewswire/ -- The Rev. Fred Phelps, who
brandishes signs such as "God Hates Fags" and declares that homosexuals
are beyond redemption, "is promoting a viewpoint that conflicts with
Christian teaching,"  Family Research Council's Director of Cultural
Studies Robert H. Knight said Monday.  "Mr. Phelps' public pronouncements
were seen most recently outside the Human Rights Campaign dinner on
Saturday night and magnified by national media coverage.  His contention
that certain people are automatically excluded from the possibility of
God's grace is unbiblical.  In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, homosexuals are
included in a list of sinners, who, if unrepentant, will not inherit the
kingdom of God.  Verse 11 says, however, 'And that is what some of you
were.

     "The implication," Knight added, "is clearly that the apostle Paul's
followers included former homosexuals.   So where do Mr. Phelps and his
group come off saying that these people are unworthy of the same salvation
that he claims to have? God does condemn homosexuality, but he doesn't
'hate' homosexuals.   We believe that he wants them to change -- like any·
other sinners.

          "We regret that Mr. Phelps has offered the media a crude
caricature of Christian resistance to the homosexual agenda.   His views do
not represent those of Family Research Councilor any other pro-family
organization with which we work.  While we share Mr. Phelps' opposition to
homosexual activism we believe that homosexual individuals deserve
compassion and are capable of hope, healing and salvation.   We also call
on the leaders of the Human Rights Campaign and other homosexual activists
to expunge the word 'hate' from their regular discourse.   We respect them
as individuals even though we are compelled to resist their agenda.   Their


personal attacks on people who disagree with their point of view are
unwarranted and divisive," Knight said.  "Recasting a sincere policy
disagreement as simply a form of 'hate,' as some participants at the White
House Conference on Hate Crimes this week have often done, is a flagrant
breach of civility and an attempt to intimidate individuals who merely
seek to exercise their freedoms of speech and conscience.

          "Personal testimonies from former homosexuals can be seen and
heard on our new video documentary: Hope & Healing: Stories of Coming Out
of Homosexuality. A companion booklet, also entitled Hope & Healing,
offers an authentic Christian approach of ministering to people struggling
with homosexuality," Knight concluded.
