TEXT:
I think its time to bug Bill Corr again. Rich Tarpelin was supposed to
talk to Dodd to temper him before the press conference on the DeWine-Dodd
bill and didn't.  According to Tim Westmoreland of the Pediatric AIDS
Foundation, DeWine was fine and Dodd wasn't (went on and on about how we
should do this through the market, not by regulation).  So, now it will be
even harder for us to do this by regulation.  Grrrr!!!!

Call me if any of this rambling doesn't make sense.
