TEXT:

I believe that it is a mistake to require in our interim procedure
the type of year-by-year sliding scale income estimates that we
have in the draft letter now.  It is simply too complex. This
level of complexity conflicts with the reason for the interim
procedure, which is to establish a reasonable approach to protect
eligible individuals who may have moved around alot, had numberous
employers and have very incomplete records. This also means that
estimates of income year-by-year over a ten year period would be
extremely difficult (and would be exacerbated if the individual
needed to rely upon spouse or parent records).
On the State end of this, I think this would be extraordinarily
complex for State workers to implement.  If States howl about the
interim procedure, we have not gained anything.
I certainly recognize the argument that we don't want this to be
viewed as lax by some members of Congress or the public, but 1)
we will be able to point to procedures for claims for overpayments
and 2) this is an interim measure. Also, perhaps we can set
something up so that will less formally work to help individuals
accurately judge whether they are likely to meet earning
requirements -- perhaps working with groups to help people
understand that there are escalating minimum earning levels and
they should take care before making their attestations.
thanks
