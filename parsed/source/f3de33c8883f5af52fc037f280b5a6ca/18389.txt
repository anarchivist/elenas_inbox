TEXT:
Rahm, Bruce, Elena:

Just a quick note on tomorrow's COPS meeting. While one part of the
meeting will be an update on the program from Joe Brann and John Hart,
there are 4 things we need to cover. They are:

1.  Stick by the 100,000 goal (semper fidelis).  Rahm and Bruce, I need
you to do a brief introduction that makes clear to everybody that we
haven't backed off of this goal.  As you know, Justice was planning an
"exit strategy" for 75,000, and we need to make sure that the new
Associate AG (Ray Fisher) gets this message.

2. Work Out Policy Issues.     Bruce and Elena, we need to make sure that
Justice and OMB understand the need to generate some fresh options on some
of the outstanding policy issues (retention, waivers, targeting, etc.).
COPS isn't doing enough innovative thinking on how to keep demand up ... OMB
doesn't want to change the program guidelines if it screws up the 100,000
count ... and Main Justice is more beholden to its appropriators than us
when considering some "tweeks" to the program. We need to push Justice
and OMB to solve these problems to our satisfaction -- not theirs or the
Hill's.    I suggest that we commission a WH-OMB-DOJ group work to do some
trouble shooting.

3.  Draft A Communications Plan. Lastly, Rahm, we need to get Justice and
COPS to think strategically and suggest 8 to 10 events over the next year
to promote the COPS program. Having 2 to 3 days notice when the next set
of grants is coming out is not enough. We should look for major law
enforcement forums and milestones to do events.

Many thanks -- and please don't forget to attend,



Jose'
