RE:            DOJ DEBT COLLECTION

DATE:          NOVEMBER 21, 1997

SUMMARY

        There is approximately $6 billion in uncollected federal criminal debt. A project that
would have created anational database to oversee the collection has been terminated because it
was behind schedule and plagued with problems. Only $2 billion of the $6 billion can reasonably
be collected.

       DOJ currently has two projects ongoing to address some of these issues. First, DOJ
expects to award a contract in January 1998 to develop software to collect only federal civil debt.
 However, the software is being developed to include data fields for criminal debt, so that
criminal debt collection can be implemented in the future This software would be installed at
the Executive Office of the U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Attorneys' Offices, Main Justice, and any
DOJ field office. Second, DOJ has proposed legislation to address some of the problems the
Government has in enforcing and collecting primarily federal criminal debt.

BACKGROUND

        The National Fine Center was authorized by the Criminal Fine Improvements Act of
1987, PI. 100-185, 101 Stat. 1279. The Criminal Fine Improvements Act of 1987 contemplated
that the director ofthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) would establish a
single national center within the judicial branch for processing fines, restitution, and special
assessments.

       There is a great need for a collection service for criminal fines because many fines are not
recovered. For instance, as of early 1992, DOJ estimated that the total amount of unpaid
criminal debt exceeded $l.6 billion. By late 1996, the amount of unpaid criminal debt had
ballooned to nearly $6 billion.

       Once the criminal debts were collected, the National Fine Center, via the Treasury, was to
make payments to either the victims (e.g. federal agencies, private corporations, banks, or
individuals) or to the Crime Victims Fund. The Crime Victims Fund was established by the
Victims of Crime Act, P.L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2170. Virtually, all criminal fines, special
assessments, and bail bond forfeitures are deposited into this fund, which is administered by the


                                                 1
                                                                        Hex·Dump Conversion ·

Office for Victims of Crime in the Department of Justice. Ninety percent of the Crime Victims
Fund is distributed to states for compensation programs such as rape crisis centers and child
abuse centers that provide financial assistance to victims and survivors of victims of criminal
violence.
                                         .
        The National Fine Center was closed on November 15, 1996. Debt collection will revert
to the decentralized system employed by each federal judicial district in the country, which, in
many districts, involve catalog cards or ledger books.

        Part of the reason that the amount of uncollected debt is so high is that "vanity fines" stay
on the books. Vanity fines are fines with no realistic expectation that they will be collected. In
fact, Kathleen Hegerty at the Department of Justice estimates that two-thirds of the current $6
billion in criminal debt is uncollectible, or, in other words, approximately only $2 billion can
reasonably be collected. In fact, one of the recommendations of a May 1995 GAO report was
to establish procedures for determining the collectibility of criminal debt accounts .

      . Despite the uncollectibility of much of the accrued criminal debt, there is still potentially
a surplus, given a few criminal defendants with large fines and penalties that do have the ability
to pay such as ADM and Daiwa, the Korean bank.

II.    THE PROPOSED DOJ LEGISLATION

       DOJ has drafted a bill that would improve the ability of Government a~tomeys to collect
the approximately $6 billion of debt owed to the United States. This legislation would require
no additional cost to implement. As an initial rough estimate, DOJ expects that this legislation
will improve collection of approximately $200 million of the outstanding debt.

       The bill is already drafted but needs some final vetting by DOJ.

       Title I of the draft bill amends the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990 (the
"Act"). Title II of the bill, in large part, amends Title 18 of the United States Code. The
provisions in Title II are largely the same as the restitution provisions in a draft bill that DOJ
proposes to transmit on victims' rights.

·      Surcharge. The bill amends § 3011 (a) of the Act to clarify that the United States is
       entitled to recover a surcharge anytime it is required to bring a legal action to collect a
       debt. The surcharge provision is intended to compensate the United States for the cost of
       litigation and is in lieu of attorney's fees.

·      Discovery. The bill makes it clear that discovery is not limited to cases in which the
       United States has sought a prejudgment or postjudgment remedy.

·      Assists in determining a debtor's ability to pay a judgment through disclosure of


                                                  2
                                                                      Hex·Dump Conversion

    grand jury {"mancial information and better access to other financial information at
    the time of conviction and after judgment is entered.
    ·      Disclosure of grand jury information regarding financial condition. This
           section ofthe bill will modify a Supreme Court decision that did not pennit a
           criminal government attorney (the attorney in the grand jury proceeding) to
           disclose financial infonnation to the civil government attorney (the attorney
           responsible for enforcing the fine or restitution imposed by the court in a criminal
           case).

·   Investigative power. The bill pennits investigation prior to the institution of a civil
    action by authorizing a civil investigative demand. Such a procedure is available in
    other civil contexts, like antitrust and FTC investigations.

·   Provides nationwide standards for property that civil debtors can protect from
    seizure.

    ·      Uniform federal law exempting property. This bill creates a unifonn federal
           exemption law that applies to all federal debts collected under the Act.
           Previously, exemptions for certain property was detennined by looking to state
           law.

·   Eliminates limitation on value of property that may be used to satisfy a debt.
    Section 131 of the bill clarifies that any of the debtor's property may be seized and used
    for satisfaction of the judgment debt, subject to the applicable exemptions. The
    amendment eliminates a confusing limitation on the value of the property that may be
    seized and sold. The limitation currently conflicts with § 3203(h) which clearly
    contemplates that an execution sale will yield a surplus on occasion.

·   Installment payment order. The bill increases the discretion of the court to fashion an
    appropriate remedy by pennitting the court to issue an installment payment order
    notwithstanding that the debtor's wages are subject to an order of garnishment. A wage
    garnishment is limited to 25% of the disposable earnings paid by the debtor's employer.
    However, a debtor's salary may be only a small fraction of the debtor's total income.
    Furthennore, a debtor may manipulate actual salary by negotiating to receive less salary
    and more benefits such as living expenses.

·   Eliminates impediments to seizure of wages and bank accounts while preserving the
    debtor's extensive due process rights.

    ·      Waiting period for garnishment. The bill amends § 3205(b)(1) of the Act so
           that the 30-day waiting period applies only to garnishment of the judgment
           debtor's earnings rather than other assets such as bank accounts. The amendment
           is necessary to prevent the fraudulent transfer of non-wage assets during a

                                             3
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion ·
           previously afforded 30-day window of opportunity.

·   Garnishment notice by mail. The bill permits the service of a writ of garnishment by
    first class mail or in any manner provided under § ·3004. The amendment eliminates the
    delay often associated with other methods of service and reduces the burden on the
    United States marshals.

·   Authorizes injunctive relief to prevent the dissipation of the debtor's assets while a
    debt to the United States remains unpaid.

    ·      Restraining notice. The bill adds a new enforcement procedure, the restraining
           notice. This provision would require a judgment debtor to preserve his
           nonexempt assets while the judgment remains unsatisfied. The restraining notice
           does not restrain the transfer or disposition of any property necessary for the
           support of the debtor or the debtor's dependents, or property necessary to operate
           the debtor's business. Service of the restraining notice freezes the debtor's
           property to prevent its transfer or dissipation.

·   Clarifies the court's authority to prevent the debtor from evading, hindering, or
    delaying debt collection efforts by the United States.

    ·      Court may aid in enforcement of judgments. The bill makes clear that the
           United States may enlist the aid of the court in the enforcement of its judgments.
           For instance, if the debtor has placed property outside the jurisdiction of the
           United States by transferring funds to an offshore bank, this amendment will
           permit the court to issue an order directing the debtor to wire transfer the funds to
           the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Similar turnover powers are authorized
           in the Bankruptcy Code.

    ·      Enhancement of enforced collection of criminal debts. Without this
           amendment, the United States cannot invoke any procedures under the Act until
           the defendant has been sentenced to pay a financial penalty. The new provision
           permits the court, after a verdict, plea agreement, or decision in favor of the
           United States, to order the examination of any party and to issue a restraining
           notice with the same effect as if the restraining notice had been issued after
           judgment. The ability to examine the defendant immediately after an adverse
           decision, coupled with a restraining notice, will assist in preventing fraudulent
           transfers.

·   Extends the time for undoing collusive transfers of property when made to avoid
    paying criminal fines and restitution. (Makes the property available to pay the
    debt.)

                                                                      Hex·Dump Conversion
    ·      Statutes of limitation for fraudulent transfer actions. Under current law, the
           United States is often time-barred in seeking to set aside a fraudulent transfer
           because the United States could not implement an action until a debt was actually
           created at the time of sentencing. Even when the right to set aside the transfer is
           not time-barred, there are other enforcement difficulties like the jurisdiction of the
           enforcement transferring to the probation service during any period of probation.
           The bill amends the statute of limitations to mitigate these impediments to the
           enforcement of restitution and fines.

·   Eliminates impediments to the enforcement of criminal monetary penalties, and
    strengthens the rights of victims of crime.

    ·      Enforcement of criminal monetary penalties. The bill improves the
           enforcement of criminal monetary penalties. The bill allows the Government to
           seek accelerated payment of criminal monetary penalties if the court ordered
           deferred payment or payment in installments, and it is later determined that the
           debtor has the ability to pay a greater amount.

·   Clarifies that the United States may enforce victim restitution rights under the
    Federal Debt CoUection Procedures Act.

    ·      Restitution enforcement. The bill conforms the restitution enforcement
           provisions in the Child Support Recovery Act of 1994 with those authorized for
           other types of restitution under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act.

    ·      Restitution not dischargeable in bankruptcy. The bill clarifies that orders of
           restitution, like criminal fines, are not dischargeable in federal bankruptcy
           proceedings.

    ·      Restitution as part of plea agreement. The bill requires the court to order
           restitution as agreed to by the parties in the plea agreement. In the past, despite
           any agreement that the debtor has made in the plea, the court has not included this
           restitution as part of its order.

    ·      Restitution with large number of victims. The bill provides the court with a
           variety of options when the number of victims or the complexity of the victims'
           losses may prolong or overly complicate the sentencing process. The bill
           permits, among other options, the court tp create a reserve fund for restitution to
           victims when the aggregate loss is known or agreed to by the parties in the plea
           agreement, but all victims cannot be identified at the time of sentencing. After
           all identified victims are made whole, any surplus funds remaining in the reserve
           fund will be deposited in the Crime Victims Fund.

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

    ·     Joint and severable liability for restitution. The bill adopts the principle of
          joint and severable liability with respect to restitution among co-defendants,
          making each debtor potentially liable for the full amount of each victim's loss.
          The adoption of this basic principle of tort liability streamlines the enforcement
          process arid promotes prompter recovery of the victim's full losses.

    ·      Disclosure of information to enforce restitution. The bill permits the
           Government to assist victims in enforcing restitution orders by disclosing certain
           information about the debtor that might otherwise by protected from disclosure by
           the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.c. § 552(a).

·   Eliminates the need to sue student loan debtors twice before enforcing collection.

·   Assists in stopping federal payments and privileges (such as small business loans,
    hunting licenses) to debtors with outstanding federal civil and criminal judgments.

·   Sections Related to the Elimination of the National Fine Center.

    ·     The bill provides that the payment of fines, restitution, special assessments, and
          bail bond forfeitures shall be made in accordance with procedures established by
          the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. This
          change is necessary because of the elimination of the National Fine Center.

    ·     The bill repeals what was widely regarded as a mandate for a National Fine
          Center. The new wording requires the Director of the Administrative Office of
          the United States Courts to maintain oversight of the management of criminal
          debt information.

    ·     The bill completes the termination of the National Fine Center by eliminating
          mandatory annual funding transfers to the judicial branch from the Crime Victims
          Fund for the operation of a National Fine Center, and by requiring the return of
          unspent funds from the National Fine Center. The amendment permits the
          Director of the Crime Victims Fund to use the funds returned to the Crime
          Victims Fund for the benefit of crime victims in the federal criminal justice
          system.
