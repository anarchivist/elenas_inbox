TEXT:
I spoke with Reyes, Becerra, and Guitierrez separately on this yesterday
and have been in touch with Alan Erenbaum (INS/Leg). This is what I've
gathered: Reyes is actually a little nervous about the reaction to the
proposal but felt that Rogers was driving action on this and on him very
hard in order to get it up at his Commerce, Justice, State Mark up next
week.  The fact is that Rep. Lamar Smith is not excited about doing this
either but Rogers is really pressuring him to act before the approps.
mark-up as well.  So late Wednesday evening they came up with the modified
Reyes proposal.  Reyes told me he believes its better to go with this
proposal than with the Rogers proposal and feels like he has made a
significant contribution by pulling Rogers off his original bill.   Becerra
and Guitierrez both understand the shortcomings in Reyes' proposal but
really wanted the Administration and groups to take the lead on
highlighting these problems first.   Reyes has actually said that he's not
totally comitted to the proposal and wants to see what reaction he gets
from the Administration, Hispanic Caucus and the groups.   But the fact is
that the most important response for him will be what the rest of the
Hispanic Caucus has to say about the proposal. Becerra and Guitierrez
have agreed to talk to Reyes over the weekend.    I know that Peter Jacoby
was also trying to ensure that Gephardt speak with Reyes to pull him off
as well. We should-try to meet on Monday (or earlier) both internally and
with the groups.  Should I set this up or do you want to? Let me know.
Janet.

naturalization bill in full committee is scheduled for Tues--the groups
will try to get it postponed--unclear what will happen--we need to regroup

Maria,
I spoke with Marisa Demeo from MALDEF late yesterday.   The advocates had a
conference call last night to determine next steps.   All of the groups
oppose the Reyes bill. When he first introduced it, he said he would add
additional provisions (chiefly dealing with the services side of the
operation) before it moved forward.  However, as we can see, he has not
done that.

The CHC is on the fence.   Becerra and the rest of the caucus signed on to
the original bill, and it will take a lot of convincing to persuade them
not to go with Reyes.  Right now, the CHC is trying to set up a meeting
for today before 2pm to discuss their position. Neither Reyes nor Becerra
will be in town on Monday.   The groups convinced the caucus to invite INS
to their meeting today so that they could be briefed on the
Administration'S plan and why it is better for their constituents.
Becerra has indicated that if the groups can come forward with specifics
about what makes the bill bad (including policy and politics), the caucus
could be persuaded. Also, Reyes'S staff has indicated that he might be
willing to lift the Administration's proposal on services into the bill +
create a Director of Services equivalent to the Director of the Bureau of
Enforcement ..

According to Marisa, Smith is scheduled to mark this up on Tuesday.
Rogers will then take this as a signal to allow him to make this part of
his CJS appropriations package.
MALDEF is very concerned about the CHC.  If they support this bill, it
will really move.

Julie
