        TEXT:
        So that eveyone is on the same page or near it, here's a recap of
        yesterday's meeting.  (Please let me know of any omissions/mistakes.)
        Thanks.

        DOT/DBE regs will be rolled out possibly sometime in April, but in any
        event, prior to the Senate ISTEA conference. However " Tracey is to check
        with members on whether this is the right timing.

        Richard and Tracey will work together on Senate briefings for DOT/DBE
        roll-out

        After the ISTEA conference and vote, expected in May, we will proceed with
        the roll-out of the benchmarking regs (i.e., FAR and SBA regs and Commerce
        numbers) in June/July.  Subcontracting regs will be rolled out in October
        or later.

        Sylvia and Richard will hold a conference call with David Lane to discuss
        roll-out.

        The Vice President will do the Hubzones announcement on April 3/4.

        The Vice President and Secretary Rubin will do the mentoring announcement
        in the near term also, probably while the President is in Africa.

        A POTUS affirmative action event (education/business) will be decided at a
        later date.
