TEXT:
1. On press invites, Elaine would like Bruce's advice in deciding which
reporter would be more appropriate from papers/outlets where they have
more than one name.  Here's the list:

ABC News:        Mark Halperin, Rebecca Chase
Boston Globe:    Peter Gosselin, Roslyn Jackler
Business Wk:     Howard Gleckman, Mike McNamee, Paul Magnusson
LA Times:        Ron Brownstein, Melissa Healy, Gayle Pollard
NYTimes:         Jason DeParle, Robert Pear
USA Today:       Rick Wolf, Walter Shapiro
US News:         David Whitman, Susan Dentzer
Wall St. J:      Chris Georges, Dana Milbank, Laurie McGinley
Wash Post:       Judith Havemann, Barbara Vobejda

2.  Elaine says that Eli may be open to managing this coalition to
mentor/retain jobs after it's announced.  Since we had talked about a
separate group to do this, I just wanted to make sure this was OK with you.

3.   The VP's office is putting together a little booklet on the federal
hiring initiative, with a cover letter from the VP to the President
reporting on what agencies will do, followed by an agency-by-agency
description and a photo of each Cabinet secretary.   They want to
distribute this at the 5/20 launch of Eli's group, but Cynthia and I are
telling them that the federal hiring news may be a distraction from the
main message of that day, which is private sector hiring.   Let us know if
you disagree.
