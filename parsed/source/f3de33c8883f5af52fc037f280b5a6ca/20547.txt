     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
     RADIO ADDRESS ON FOOD SAFETY
     JULY 4, 1998
             Good morning.   I have just returned from my trip to China, a great
     and a~cient nation that is undergoing historic change.   I saw evidence of
     that change in the faces of people free for the first time to work in jobs
     of their own choosing '"   in the new private businesses that are helping
     ChinaD,s economy to grow ... and in the first free elections of local
     leaders in Chinese villages.   I was able to speak directly, not only to
     the Chinese government, but to the Chinese people, about the importance of
     freedom and what it means to us in America.

             Seeing once again the power of ,these ideals makes me even prouder
     to be home in time for Independence Day, when we celebrate the freedom our
     founders fought for more than 220 years ago.

·
            The Fourth of July is also a time for families and friends to come
    together, at backyard barbecues and public parks all across America.
    Today, I want to talk to you about what I am doing to make sure that the
    food and drinks we serve to our families this Independence Day and every
    day are safe.

            AmericaO,s food supply is the most bountiful -- and the safest --
    in the world.  For nearly six years, I have worked hard made food safety a
    top priority.  I signed into law legislation to keep harmful pesticides
    off our fruits and vegetables. We put in place strong protections to
    ensure that seafood is safe, and we are modernizing our meat and poultry
    safety system. Last year, we launched a nationwide early warning system
    to catch outbreaks of food-borne illness sooner, and prevent them from
    happening in the first place.

            But as much as we have done, we know we must do more to keep our
    families safe and strong. We know that older people and children are
    especially vulnerable to contaminated food.  That lesson was driven home
    tragically last year, when apple juice contaminated with a deadly strain
    of E. coli bacteria caused the death of a 16-month-old child in Washington
    State, and led to the hospitalization of more than a dozen children.

            Today, we are taking two important steps to ensure that our food supply
    is as safe as we can make it, especially for our children.   First, I am
    pleased to announce .a new rule that requires warning labels on all
    packaged juice that has not been pasteurized or processed to kill harmful
    bacteria. These warnings will help families make better decisions about
    the juice they buy -- and they will help us to prevent thousands of
    Americans from becoming ill every year.

            Second, I am directing the Department of Health and Human Services and
    the Department of Agriculture to report back to me within 90 days with a
    plan to create a new national institute for food safety.  This institute
    will bring together the talents of the most esteemed scientists in the
    government, universities, and business to develop cutting edge food safety
    techniques.

            I am doing what I can to protect our families from contaminated food.
    But Congress must do its part to ensure the safety of AmericaO,s food
    supply.  First and most important, it must fully fund my $101 Million food
    safety initiative, which among other things will pay for 225 new FDA
    inspectors and. employees, to keep unsafe food away from our borders, out
    of our stores, and off of our dining room tables.   It must give the FDA
    greater authority to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, and other food
    products that are produced under safety conditions that do not match our
    own strict standards.   It must give the USDA new authority to impose tough
    fines on food producers who violate those standards -- and to issue
    mandatory recalls of unsafe meat and poultry before it reaches our
    tables.   And it should confirm a repected, experienced scientist, Dr.
    Jane Henney, to lead our food safety efforts as commissioner of the FDA.

            Food can never be made entirely safe, and every parent has a
    responsibility to handle food carefully. But we must do everything we can
    to protect the food Americans eat and to keep our families strong. WeO,re
    working to give families a little more peace of mind. ThatD,s one way to
    keep our nation strong as we move into the 21st Century.

            Happy 4th of July, and thanks for listening.
