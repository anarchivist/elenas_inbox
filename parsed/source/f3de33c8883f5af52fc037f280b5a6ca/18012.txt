TEXT:
I am faxing you a draft of a letter written by the NSC (Scott Busby) from
Hilley to Lamar Smith reo Haitians.  I think that it speaks a little too
generally about "Haitians" rather than more specifically about Guantanamo
Haitians, and then makes a sort of overbroad foreign policy statement (i
suppose to support our possible use of DED later on).  I left a message
for Scott so that I could discuss this with him, but I wanted to get your
reaction to this.  Thanks.
