Hi Elena. I've just come on board as Sylvia Mathew's Special Assistant
and was wondering if you could help me out on a project she's asked me to
staff.  I had the pleasure of meeting you briefly at the Mexico City
meeting the other day.

Sylvia will be addressing the American Association of Adverstising
Agencies next Tuesday and she expects certain questions. One of them has
to do with the Tobacco Settlement.

Sylvia asked that I call you and get your input/advice/ assistance on
getting background information on this subject.

If it's not too much to ask, could you think through what can of
information/paper I could get to 1) get up to speed on this issue as well
then 2) prep her for the speech on Tuesday.   Any information/ advice you
can offer will be greatly appreciated.

I'm at 456-2016 or you can get me by email.

Thank for your assistance and I look forward to seeing you at the Mexico
City meeting today at 5PM.
