                    PRESIDENT WILLIAM: J. CLINTON
          REMARKS FOR WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON CHILD CARE
                          THE WHITE HOUSE
                           OCTOBER 23, 1997

       Six years ago today, at Georgetown University, I proposed a new vision for America, a
new partnership between our people and our government to provide opportunity for all, demand
responsibility from all, and restore a sense of community to this great nation.

        Strengthening families was and remains at the core of this vision. Time and technology
have fundamentally altered the way we live, work and do business. But the toughest, most
rewarding and most important job in the human experience remains the same -- that of being a
parent.

        As the Catholic Conference has noted, no government can love a child and no' policy can
substitute for a family's care. But there is much that our society can do to help all parents meet
their duties to their children .- even as the demands of work and the expectations of society shift
all around us.

       That is why we are here today. Ifwe are to keep families strong in the next century, if
we want to keep living in an America that honors our values as it brings greater prosperity to all
people willing to work for it, then we must address the urgent problem of child care in our
country.

        Over the past five years, we have done much to help working families. The Family and
Medical Leave Act ensures that no parent has to choose between caring for a loved one or
keeping a job when a family member falls ill. The expanded earned income tax credit ensures
that parents who work do not have to raise their children in poverty. Our expanded Head Start
programs are now serving more families than ever before. We have collected record amounts or
child support, making sure that more parents take responsibility for their children. We have
worked to increase child care assistance by nearly 70 percent, helping families pay for care for
one million children. The historic balanced budget I signed this summer provides a $500 per
child tax credit and helps parents save or pay for their children's college educations through tax
free IRAs, expanded loans, grants and other tax credits.

       But we must do more. I believe that strengthening child care is the next great frontier in
empowering all Americans to fulfill their greatest promise as parents and as workers, as
guardians of the next generation and as citizens whose labor and ingenuity in the workplace will
keep America strong into the next millennium.

       Our workforce does not look like it did a generation ago. Over the past half-century,
millions of women have chosen to pursue careers that have enabled them to take economic


                                                 1
                                                                   Hex-Dump ConversIon
charge of their own lives, boost family income and contribute their talents and energies to
society. At the same time, economic shifts have forced many families to rely on a second
income to make ends meet. So, as more women continue to work outside the home, whether by
choice or necessity, child care has become a fact oflife.

        The quality of care a child receives in his or her earliest years can have lifelong
consequences. Stable and stimulating care can lead to stronger academic and social skills, build
self-esteem and a capacity for trust and relationships. For children in high-risk environments,
high quality care in the earliest years can mean the difference between a life full of hope and
accomplishment or one diminished by crime, difficulty at school, and despair.

         But even as demand for child care grows and even as we leam more about the important
role it plays in child development, our child care system is failing too many families. Too often,
child care is unaffordable, inaccessible, or simply unsafe.

        Child care costs today strain millions of family budgets, draining as much as a quarter of
a working family's income. Government assistance meets just a quarter of the need. Last year,
we fought and won the battle to expand child care assistance as part of welfare reform. This
new funding -- $4 billion over six years -- has given states an unprecedented opportunity to be
leaders and innovators in our efforts to make child care more affordable to the working poor. If
we expect all welfare recipients to go to work, then we must help them afford the high quality
child care that will make work pay ... that will enable them to leave their children in care that is
safe and secure.

        But even for those who can afford it, good child care is often hard to find. Waiting lists
take months or years to move, forcing many parents to cobble together unstable child care
arrangements. The child care shortage puts older children at risk, as well. Today, five million
children between the ages of five and fourteen are left to fend for themselves after school,
increasing the chances that they try drugs, alcohol and tobacco or be victims of crime.

        Finally, studies have shown that many child care arrangements are unsafe. The tragedies
that have befallen so many families who depend on child care continue to make headlines all
across America. We must make sure that no more families suffer such needless heartbreak.

        This conference is an important step toward addressing all of these problems. What we
learn today should spur us to find ways to help all parents afford the type of safe, high-quality
child care that best suits their needs -- whether it's at home, a child care center, or a neighbor's
house. In the coming months, my Administration will develop a plan, which I will unveil in my
next State of the Union and budget, to improve access, affordability and assure the safety of child
care in our country.

       In the meantime, I am announcing four new actions we can take today. First, I arn asking
Secretary Rubin to oversee a working group on child care. I arn charging the group, which will


                                                 2
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

consist primarily of business leaders, to work with labor and community representatives to
examine ways businesses can help employees afford high quality child care. It's simply good
business practice to help workers become better parents. Few people can give 100 percent to
their jobs if their hearts are weighed down by worry about their children.

        Second, I am transmitting to Congress the "National Crime Prevention and Privacy
Compact" which will enable states to share criminal history information for a few specific
purposes besides criminal investigations, including background checks on child care workers. I
urge Congress to pass and states to ratify this legislation. We know that the quality of care our
children receive is directly related to the competence of our child care providers. That is why
we must weed out those people who have no business taking care of children in the first place.

        But at the same time, we must help exemplary caregivers provide even better care for our
children. So I am establishing a new scholarship for child care education. The scholarship will
help students earn degrees in exchange for a promise to remain in the child care field for at least
one year.

       Finally, I am announcing a Administration effort to bring more community service
opportunities to after-school programs across the country. Service can be an enriching part of
any child's life. Through a new how-to manual and technical assistance from National Service
volunteers, we will help after-school programs devise curriculums that include service.

        For centuries, the American Dream has represented a fundamental compact between all
Americans and society: Everyone who works hard and plays by the rules can build better lives
for themselves and their families. For too many Americans, child care has become a stubborn
obstacle to that Dream. Too many parents have been forced to make impossible choices
between work and family, between putting food on the table and providing adequate child care
for their children. These are choices America's families should not have to make. With the
committed efforts of all of us, they will no longer have to. By strengthening child care, we can
help our parents fulfill their most sacred duty -- to raise strong, healthy and moral children -- and
keep the American Dream alive for today's and future generations.
