Squeamish on needle exchanges

    Boston and Cambridge have had a needle exchange program for four years
now, and despite opponents' warnings, intravenous drug use has not
increased as a result. What has happened is that drug addicts have reduced
their chances of getting and spreading AIDS while increasing their chances
of getting into treatment. According to the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health, about 600 addicts enroll in the program each year,
receiving not just sterile needles but drug education, HIV prevention
materials, and referrals to detox centers or other treatment options. Many
addicts simply drop in for the needles and skip the counseling, but the
program is a crucial bridge to treatment when they are ready for it.

   At the federal level, a 1992 congressional ban on funding needle
exchange programs expired yesterday. Unfortunately, the Clinton
administration has not taken the lead in restoring funds for this
life-saving plan. The administration is split, with drug czar Barry
McCaffrey opposed, Clinton's AIDS adviser, Sandra Thurman, in favor, and
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala - who is charged with
deciding the question - determinedly straddling the fence.

     McCaffrey argues that the government should be sending an unambiguous
  "no use" message and that the money is better spent on treatment.
  Certainly needle exchange programs cannot be a substitute for drug
. treatment or prevention. But they are a proven means of AIDS prevention.
  Sources as reliable as the Centers for Disease Control, the National
  Institutes of Health, and the General Accounting Office have concluded


that needle exchange efforts reduce HIV transmission without increasing
drug use. Still the administration calls for more study.

   In the meantime, needles are speeding AIDS infections. Intravenous drug
users, their sexual partners, and their children represent the largest
segment of people with AIDS in Massachusetts: 46 percent. Fortunately,
needle programs are cheap, and local funds and private donations can fill
in. But the real message the Clinton administration is sending is that
clean-needle programs are somehow tainted. That is not just wrong; it is
deadly.
