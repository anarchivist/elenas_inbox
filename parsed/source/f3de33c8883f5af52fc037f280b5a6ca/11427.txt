                            A NATIONAL EFFORT TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE:
                         SMALLER CLASSES WITH WELIrPREPARED TEACHERS
                                                February 23, 1999


AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIPARTISAN PROGRESS IN EDUCATION Last year, President Clinton
proposed a historic initiative to reduce class size in the early grades -- when children learn to read and get a
solid foundation in the basics -- by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers over seven years. Congress
enacted a down payment on this request last year with bipartisan support, providing a one-time $1.2 billion
appropriation to help communities hire approximately 30,000 teachers nationwide. This week, Congress
has the opportunity to build on its bipartisan efforts to reduce class size and finish the job by passing
legislation authorizing this initiative for the next six years.

SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE LOCAL PLANNING. Under the initiative enacted into law last year, school
districts will begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin reducing class sizes this
fall. While last year's one-year appropriation provided an important start on President Clinton's seven-year
initiative, Congress has the chance to support effective local planning by giving school districts the
confidence they need that funding will be available under this initiative for years to come. Rejecting this
legislation this week will send a dangerous message to school districts about the prospects for continued
funding just when they are beginning to make decisions about how to implement this new initiative.

INCREASED FUNDING FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION                                In this year's budget,
President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed $1.4 billion to hire a total 38,000 teachers.

·                This initiative would provide [STATE] with [STATE ALLOCATION] to support
                 [NUMBER OF TEACHERS] to reduce class size in early grades across the state.


SMALL CLASSES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide
more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result students learn
more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. According to studies, students from smaller
classes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana, Tennessee, and across the nation outperformed their peers in
larger classes.   Moreover, research shows that reduced class size makes the greatest difference for
minority and disadvantaged students. For example, a national study of 10,000 4th graders and 10,000 8th
graders found the greatest impact of smaller classes on innefcity youth.

SUPPORT FROM MAJOR EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS. Major education organizations have said
that the President's class size initiative is the kind of initiative that has the potential to make a real difference
in raising the academic achievement of young Americans. These organizations include the American
Association of School Administrators (AASA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the Council of
Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the Council of Great City Schools (CGCS), Federal Advocacy for
California Education, the National Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), the National
Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE), the National Association of State Directors of Special
Education, the National Education Association (NEA), the National Parent Teacher Association(PTA), the
National School Boards Association (NSBA), NAACP, the National Association of School Psychologists,
the International Reading Association (IRA), and the Executive Director of the Council of Scientific
Society Presidents.
