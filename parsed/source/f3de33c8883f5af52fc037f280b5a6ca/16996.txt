FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      SEPTEMBER 17, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today approved, with
some modifications, the Chafee/Warner/Baucus highway bill.   Chafee
indicated that Lott has scheduled floor action around October 1.

         [DOT letter sent 9/16: D&commend you ... for the thoughtful compromises
that are clearly reflected in ... S. 1173 ... 1 am especially pleased that the
bill is a 6-year measure that conforms to the bipartisan balanced budget
agreement ... 08; the letter also identifies concerns with specific
provisions)

AS required by the Item Veto Act, S. 1144, the D'Amato/Moynihan item veto
disapproval bill (disapproving cancellation of the New York Medicaid
provision) was discharged from Senate Finance Committee yesterday, 9/16.
The bill is now on the Senate calendar; a motion to proceed to the bill is
nondebatable, but there have been no ··indications yet that the Leadership
will take up the bill.

Conference action completed on FY1998 Agriculture and Legislative Branch
bills.

Senate Budget Committee Republicans have decided to move ahead with three
special task forces:   (1) social security and private savings (chaired by
Gregg) ;  (2) 150 spending (chaired by Gordon Smith);  and (3) education
(chaired by Frist) .   At the moment, it appears that there will not be a
credit task force chaired by Abraham.     Domenici plans to involve GAO in
much of the task forcesD, work.    Lautenberg has not yet decided whether
committee Dems will participate.
