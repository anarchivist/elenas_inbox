I don't know enough (and it is not in my PAD-dome) to know for sure, but
my take is that the reg is not a big enough winner issue for the
disability or immigrant community for us to promote.  If it were more to
their liking, we still probably wouldn't want to promote it because of the
likely heat on the Hill.
