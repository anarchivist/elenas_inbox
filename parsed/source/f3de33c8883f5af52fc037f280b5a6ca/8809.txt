 Antitrust
 Senate will Take Up Issue
 Of Major League Baseball's Exemption
 The route to rectifying a "76-year-old aberration" is cleared as the
 Senate plans to take up the Curt Flood Act of 1997 in an effort to clarify
 that major league baseball player relations are covered by federal
 antitrust law, according to the bill's sponsors, who July 29 announced the
 agreement of the players and the owners to the bill.
 Sens. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) characterized
 the agreement between the players and both major and minor league club
 owners as an "historic milestone in the history cif professional baseball."
 Hatch pointed out that, because of "an aberrant Supreme Court decision in
 1922, labor relations in major league baseball have not been subject to
 antitrust laws, unlike any other industry in America." Hatch attributed
 the frequent work stoppages, "including the disastrous strike of
 1994-1995," to the exemption based on Federal Baseball Club v. Nat'l
 League of Prof'l Baseball Clubs, 259 U.S. 200 (1922).
 "With this historic agree;ment," Hatch expressed confidence that the bill
 will "assure baseball fans across the U.S. that our national pastime will
 not again be interrupted by strikes."
 Leahy, concurring, noted that the trust of baseball's fans "has been
 violated over the last several years, ... most memorably in connection
 with the work stoppage of 1994-95 and the cancellation of the 1994 World
 Series. It is clear to me that the existence of an antitrust exemption
 contributed negatively to those developments."


Baseball's recovery from this low point in its history, Leahy observed,
"is being driven by the attraction of the game itself and the outstanding
skills being demonstrated by today's great players."                    .
Leahy maintained that, while Congress can't solve, and should not solve,
every problem or heal baseball's self-inflicted wounds, Congress "can pass
legislation that will declare that professional baseball can no longer
operate outside the law that applies to others."
Leahy expressed hope that, by putting this issue behind it, baseball can
continue to restore public confidence.
Hatch and Leahy surmised that Congress would take up the issue when it
returns in September, and both senators expect the bill will gain passage
with support across the board.
