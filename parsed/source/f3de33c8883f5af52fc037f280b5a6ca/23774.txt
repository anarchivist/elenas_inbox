     TEXT:
     The President departs on Friday for the west coast --- on Thursday he will
     be giving a speech about Kosovo to Veterans, we are looking for a current
     subject matter for a departure statement on Friday.  Similarly, Saturday
     is armed forces day -- the radio address could be about the troops --
     although if we have another policy issue we are open to it.  If there is
     anything to announce on Monday w/o an event -- the President will be Las


     Vegas Nevada on Monday.

     please let me know.   thanks
