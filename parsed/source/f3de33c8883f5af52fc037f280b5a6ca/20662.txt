                           REMARKS BEFORE GIRLS' NATION
                                  THE WHITE HOUSE
                                    JULY 17, 1998

       Acknowledgments: AG Reno; Sec. Shalala; My Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs,
Janet Murguia, who represented the great state of Kansas in the Girls' Nation Class of 1977;
Alana Aldag, President, Girls' Nation 1998; Jennifer Hall, Vice-President.            .

        Welcome to the White House. I hope you've had a good week in Washington. Later, I
will be attending the 35th reunion of my own Boys Nation class. It's difficult for me to believe
that so many years have passed since that summer. The people I met then -- from my fellow Boys
Nation senators to President Kennedy -- made me believe that anything was possible -- that by
staying involved in our communities and in our democracy, we could change the world.

        I believe this is true for you, too. You are living in a time of even greater possibility,
perhaps the most exciting in the history of America. Just think of all the revolutionary changes
that have taken place over the course of your short lifetimes: The Cold War, which cast a
shadow over your parents and older siblings' childhoods, has ended. Technology has advanced at
a breathtaking pace -- fundamentally altering the way we all live, work, and learn. A typical
laptop computer today has more computer power in it than the world's largest supercomputer did
in the year you were bom.

        And so many of the barriers that kept women from making the most of their potential and
contributing their talents to our society have fallen away: Today, a lawyer in America is 12 times
more likely to be a woman than a lawyer in 1963 -- the summer I was a Boys Nation Senator.
Women are eaming more college degrees than men and even outnumber them in graduate schoo!.
 Women-owned businesses are growing faster than the national economy. 41 % of my own
administration appointees -- beginning with Sec. Shalala and Atty. Gen. Reno -- are women, by
far the highest percentage of any Presidency. And I look forward to the day when I read in the
paper that America's new president has invited her own Girls Nation class for a reunion
celebration at the White House.
        We must seize this moment of unprecedented opportunity to strengthen America for the
21 st Century. Today, I want to talk to you about our shared responsibility to fight one of the
greatest threats to the future of our young people -- the national epidemic in teen smoking. I
want to talk about what my administration will do and what you, as some of America's leading
young people, can do to win this fight.
        Every day, 3,000 young people take up smoking. 1,000 of them will die early as a result.
 Today, millions of young people will never reach their greatest potential because of a deadly
addiction that could easily have been prevented.
        That is why we cannot rest until we have passed comprehensive, bipartisan legislation to
raise the price of cigarettes, give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco as a drug, stop

                                               Automated Records Management System
                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
drives, and protect farmers and farming communities. And that's why, even as I work to pass
this legislation, I'm going to do everything I can as President to stop teen smoking.
        For decades, the tobacco companies have sought to hide the truth about the dangers of
smoking and about their own efforts to target children. Even as they publicly denied the
addictiveness of nicotine, they conducted secret research in their labs, devised secret marketing
strategies in their boardrooms to addict children to smoking for life. How do we know this?
Because the tobacco company executives and scientists left a paper trail.ofmemos and reports
detailing these strategies and findings --- never thinking that they would see the light of public
scrutiny.
          With the help of the courts, these documents are becoming public. The documents tell
 us -- in the tobacco companies' own words -- how children and minorities became pawns in their
 efforts to recruit new customers. There are memos admitting in plain English that "the base of
 our business is the high school student." Memos saying that "creating a fad [in the 14-20 year
 old] market can be a great bonanza" for the tobacco company. And even as industry
.spokespeople insisted that young people were off-limits for advertising strategies, one company
 document from 1984 recommended targeting "younger adult smokers" because they were the
 only source of "replacement smokers" in the future.
       Let's agree on at least one thing: Children are not the future of our tobacco companies.
They are the future of America. And we must not let their future, or America's future, go up in
smoke.
        These documents contain a treasure trove of information -- information that can be used
to save lives. Public health experts can design more effective anti-smoking strategies by
studying the marketing plans in the documents. Scientists can look to the documents for findings
that can aid their research into nicotine addiction and tobacco-related illnesses. And all
Americans can understand the role the tobacco industry has played in hooking our children to the
deadly habit of smoking.
       There are tens of millions of pages of these documents. While some of them are already
posted on the Internet, most are stored in depositories all across the country -- and as far away as
England. They are not easy to find. That is why I am directing the Secretary of Health and
Human Services to report back to me within 90 days with a plan to make these documents more
accessible to all Americans. The plan should include a strategy for indexing the documents and
for making that index -- as well as the documents themselves -- widely available to the public
through the Internet and other methods. The plan should also propose a strategy for a broad and
rigorous analysis of the information contained in these documents.
        I am also pleased to announce that the Attorney General will file a brief in support of the
State of Minnesota's efforts to make the tobacco industry's own, currently-existing,
computerized index to these documents available to the public.
        We must lift the tobacco industry's veil of secrecy so that all Americans can know the
origins of our epidemic of teen smoking -- and the history of our national addiction to tobacco.
Let us use the industry's darkest secrets to save a new generation of children from this deadly
habit. Armed with the facts, we can and will win this fight.

                                                                 Automated Records Management System

working to make sure this -- and all the other challenges of our time, from global warming to
greater access to education to Social Security -- do not become the intractable problems of your
future. But let me also say that you, too, can also make sure they don't diminish your futures by
taking action today. Many of you are already very involved in your communities -- as mentors,
Big Sisters, math and reading tutors, Sunday School teachers -- it's one of the reasons you were
chosen for Girls' Nation. I encourage you to stay involved and get even more involved -- help
raise public awareness of the issues you care about, propose solutions to our challenges, lobby
your elected leaders and participate in our political process. Our democracy is only as strong as
our citizens.
         As you have seen firsthand during your week in here Washington -- this is a city of
monuments to America's greatest heroes. Washington. Jefferson. Lincoln. FDR. Very few
Americans will ever be able to match their accomplishments, to leave behind as many gifts for
generations to come. But every American has the same capacity to love this country, to believe
in, to take part, to serve our democracy as much as they did. I call on you to love, to believe, to
serve America. Have faith that you, too, can make this world a better place.
