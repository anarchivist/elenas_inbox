Subject:         Senior Staff Coverage/Leave for the holidays

I will be collecting information on senior s'taff office coverage for the
upcoming holidays: December 22 - January 2. The'Chief of Staff has
requested a complete list of senior staff (Assistants to the President and
Deputy Assistants to the President only) who will be working, as well as
the names of those senior staff on call and how they may be reached during
the holidays.

Please submit your names to me as soon as possible. We will be submitting
this information to the Chief of Staff on Friday afternoon.

Also, please remind any staff members who plan to take time off for the
holidays that they are required to take annual leave for those days that
are not federal holidays.

Remember to provide the WHCA Signal Switchboard with information on how
senior staff may be contacted during the holidays.

Thank you.
