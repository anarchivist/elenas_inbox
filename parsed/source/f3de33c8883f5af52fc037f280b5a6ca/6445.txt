I just heard that these will be unveiled at a press conference at 10 a.m.
tomorrow!   Sounds like Shaw will introduce a bill, with strong
encouragement from Archer.   This comes as quite a surprise given that no
one seems to have had any specifics as of a week ago.  HHS Congressional
folks are trying to track down more information.
