Subject: announcement regarding GFSA

Bill M. sent me a cc-mail about the possible WH interest in doing an
announcement on a morning news show next Friday, June 4, on the Gun Free
Schools Act numbers of expulsions for the most recently available school
year.  This is very troubling.  Sens. Feinstein and Dorgan met with the
Secretary a few weeks ago. Feinstein was very concerned with the apparent
lack of compliance with the Act at least in California'. We indicated to
them that the Secretary would be willing to do a press event with them
linking the new numbers to efforts to prod better compliance. As you know,

    ·
the Congress is not in session next Friday and Feinstein is in California
and Dorgan is in N. Dakota with a very full schedule.

Since some of Feinstein's concern about lack of compliance stems from a
court ruling that invalidated the Gun Free School ZONES Act (which has
since
been remedied and is back in effect), we had even thought an event with the
two Senators, Secretary Riley and AG Reno might make sense.

Any way, next Friday is very troubling.   If it is going to happen -- which
I
would hope could be delayed until they are back in town on Tuesday, June 8
-- we should determine how we can do a follow up event with them and get it
locked in before this announcement so they don't feel left out of it.

For the Congressional angle of this, please get back to Tom Kelley in OLCA
since I am on travel.
