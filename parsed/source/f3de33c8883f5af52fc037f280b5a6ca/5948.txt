      The enhanced match was added in the Family Support Act when states were
      first required to meet federal standards for establishing paternities, so
      it pre-dates us.  I think we can argue that the enhanced match for these
      blood tests was necessary to get states to begin testing, but is no longer
      needed (this proposal will drop the federal match from 90 to 66%, the
      percent we pay for all child support enforcement costs).  I'm not wild
      about it but I think we can justify it.

      OMB may push back on our proposal to say we "will invite Congress to work
      together to prepare legislation" instead of "will prepare legislation to
      be transmitted to Congress." But I'll send this to them and let's see
      what they say.

I guess that's OK. Was the enhanced match for paternity establishment a
Clinton achievement, or does that pre-date us?
