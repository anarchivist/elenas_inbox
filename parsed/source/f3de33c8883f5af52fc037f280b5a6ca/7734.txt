TEXT:
I asked Gotbaum what % of all spending Lugar's bill would be for the first·
3 years (which is when he puts all his spending). Given that Lugar
yesterday increased the size of his package to $18 billion, Josh says it
is about 50% of all spending -- displacing much else.   One of the
appealing elements to Helms, Faircloth etc is that the money comes all at
once, but it may not be feasible.
