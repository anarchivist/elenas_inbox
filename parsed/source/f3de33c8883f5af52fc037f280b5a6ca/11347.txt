A   few things on the seven-year estimates:

1) The class amendment will be offered by Parry Murray,

2) The language for the amendment will definitely be taken from S.7 that
she and other Senators introduced earlier in the year.  This includes
year-by-year authorization levels and, absent a very strong and quick
request from us, they are not planning to modify that language.

3) We did fax one copy of the I-pager to the hill, but it wasn't
distributed, and we had the only copy there torn up.

4) Once we get clearance from OMB, we can send the seven year estimates
out to members and the groups. Kennedy's staff will send a packet to
members including the documents we already gave them and will add or
substitute anything else we send them in the morning.  They also are happy
to fax out any new materials to all of the groups tomorrow, though there
were apparently a few concerns raised at the mtg about using the
seven-year figures.

I have to leave for the evening shortly, but feel free to page me through
signal on my skypager.
