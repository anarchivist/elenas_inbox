TEXT:
Cathy, will you let his office know about the new time, and can you clear
him in for the meeting? I'm waiting to hear back from staff secretary,
but for now I assume we need to do a briefing on this. Has he written a
letter asking for this meeting or is there someone I can talk to about the
general items he'd like to meet with the President about? Or, if you all
can let me know the basics, I'll take a stab at it. Thanks.
