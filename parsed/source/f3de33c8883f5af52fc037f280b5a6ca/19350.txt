TEXT:
I believe it is important to get the Unz memo to the President this
weekend; staff secretary says this is our best shot to get him to read it
before he gets tied up with traveling next week.  I will be out of town
tomorrow, 'so I hope we can finish it today.

I believe the ball remains in your busy court.  I don't know if you've
read the draft yet, nor where you are as a result of yesterday's meeting.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.
