TEXT:
On the 2 issues:

1. on allowing 10 hours of job search:   Ken says he feels very strongly
on this, and keeps asserting that we already may have made this public.  I
haven't been able to confirm this, but his staff told Hill staff we want
to do this.

2. on changing the waiver trigger from 10% to 8%:      he doesn't feel so
strongly about this, and is open to discussion.

In any case, he says they need to know right away.
