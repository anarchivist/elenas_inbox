      Karen,
      I generally agree with. the comments I've seen (from Nick Gess, Nancy
      Scott-Finan, Neal Katyal ... ) A couple of other suggestions: Make section
      one about data collection -- briefly describe the type of information that
      should be collected without enumerating it in all circumstances that you
      now have in section 2 (put the onus on the AG/Treas. Sec'y to report back
      within six months on details as you mention in section l(a))   Make section
      2 a directive that the AG/Treas. Sec'y will compile the data from all affe
      cted agencies and make annual reports to the
      President that include recommendations about how to improve fair
      administration of federal law enforcement activities. Move section l(C)
      to be part of section 2.

      Sorry to be responding so late in the day ....

       As discussed at our meeting on Wednesday, attached is a rough first
      cut for an executive order that would require federal law enforcement
      agencies to collect data on the use of race and national origin in covered
      law enforcement activities. We would like to circulate something to folks
      at Treasury late today, if possible, so please forward me your comments
      today so that they can be incorporated.   My fax number is 514-9962,
      Thanks.
