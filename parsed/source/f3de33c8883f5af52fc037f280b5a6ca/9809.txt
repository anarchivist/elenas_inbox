TEXT:
Tomorrow is the first day of a two day conference sponsored by DOJ on
nursing home fraud and abuse. The conference is not being held to discuss
specific initiatives around fraud and abuse, although some may be
developed subsequent to it. We anticipate that substantive intiatives may
be developed following the conference from both DOJ and HHS. Should that
be the case, we will determine the feasibility of holding an event around
their release. While we don't anticipate much media coverage of tomorrow's
conference, Eric Holder will probably do everything in his power to
attract attention. (We write this only to cover us in the event that there
is any media coverage.)
