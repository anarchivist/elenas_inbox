        DRAFT Statement by the President

        I commend Representatives Hansen and Meehan for their hard work to put together a strong,
        bipartisan comprehensive tobacco bill designed to reduce youth smoking in this country. The
        Hansen-Meehan bill contains a substantial price increase, strong industry and company penalties
        for failure to reduce youth smoking, full FDA authority to regulate tobacco, strong restrictions on
        advertising and youth marketing of tobacco products, and strong protections against exposure to
        environmental tobacco smoke. I look forward to working with them to ensure that their
        legislation adequately protects tobacco farmers and to pass a comprehensive tobacco bill this
        year.
