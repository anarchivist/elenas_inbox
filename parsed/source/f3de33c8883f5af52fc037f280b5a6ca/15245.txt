GUIDANCE ON SEC REPORT ON SECURITIES LITIGATION
April 16, 1997


Background

      The SEC is releasing to the public on Wednesday a report to the President and Congress
on how last year's securities litigation legislation has played out.

        The report was written at the President's request. He asked for it last year after the
legislation went into effect over his veto. It examines questions like whether the number of
federal court suits has gone down and what effect there has been on state court litigation.

       The report's major conclusions are summarized in the attached two pages from the report.

Possible Questions and Answers

Q.     What's your take on the report?

A.·    We just received the report last night, and have only begun to look at it. We're pleased
       that the SEC has done this work, and look forward to analyzing it, along with the work
       that has been done by others concerning the impact of the law.         As the SEC report
       points out, it is still very early in the law's history and firm judgments on its effect are
       difficult. We're pleased that the SEC report is as broad as it is -- considering not only
       the impact of the law on litigation, but also its impact on investor protection and
       information.

Q.     So does this mean that the President was wrong to veto the bilI?

A.     No, it doesn't mean that. The President's veto was based on his concerns about whether
       the legislation would unfairly raise the bar for injured plaintiffs to get into court. We want
       to study the report to see what the SEC leamed about how the pleading standards in the
       bill are operating in practice. The concern is still there; we want to see how it has played
       out.

Q.     During the campaign, the President told some Silicon ValIey CEOs that he thought that
       California's Proposition 211 should be preempted if enacted. Some of the CEOs thought
       that he was gung-ho about this and wanted to do it right away, even if Prop 211 didn't
       pass. Where does he stand now, and what influence will this report have on his
       thinking?

A.     When he was in California, the President was speaking against the backdrop of Prop 211,
       which subsequently was roundly defeated. The SEC tried to answer the question of
       whether the Act is playing out in a way that requires further legislative action at this time.
        They concluded that this is not the case. If that case is to be made on the basis of other
                                Hex-Dump Conversion

data, we certainly would listen, and White House staff, with the help of the agencies will
do just that.

Q.    Who's in charge of this issue in the White House?

A.    Counsel's Office and the National Economic Council are coordinating the process.

Q.    Is the SEC involved?

A.    They are involved as technical advisers to our process.

Q.    How soon is the President going to make a decision about whether to support legislation?

A.    We are in the posture of reading, absorbing and analyzing the available information and
      data to see whether there is a case that something more needs to be done at this time.
      We are not on a specific timetable to conclude this work.
