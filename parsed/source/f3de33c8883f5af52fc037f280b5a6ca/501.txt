TEXT:
HHS had a meeting on the bucket with the Secretary. They decided
they advocate an alternative between the advocates' position that
it can be done administratively and the alternative view that it
must be done legislatively.  Based on some obscure legal
authority, they believe they can tell (require?) states to
continue to give Medicaid to those losing SSI for a year (?), and
that beyond that they need legislation.
I am allegedly going to get some paper on this, which I will
forward to relevant parties.
All of this, of course, puts aside the budget issue.
Elena, it would be helpful if you could talk to Anna about this,
to see if we can come to a resolution on the legal end of things.
