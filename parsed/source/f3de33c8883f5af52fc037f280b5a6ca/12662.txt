TEXT:
Education would like to release the ESEA Fact Sheet tomorrow.  OMB staff
said that the fact sheet normally accompanies the legislation -- which
isn't going up until Friday.

OMB per Barbara is ok     with letting the Dept release the Fact Sheet early
-- if you are. Given      that the Department will also release its 100-plus
page prospectus/guide     to ESEA tomorrow, there doesn't seem to be much harm
in releasing the fact     sheet.

Please let me know how you want to proceed and I will get back to OMB.
