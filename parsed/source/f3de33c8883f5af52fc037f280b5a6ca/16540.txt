TEXT:
Elena, Laura started to set up this meeting on the disability executive
order but got the word that Seth is out for 3 weeks.  Laura, I think we
have to meet without him, with Kitty Higgins there, and whoever under Seth
is appropriate.  But it will make it harder to make progress since he has
been thoughtful on this.

By the way, John Lancaster told me he and Tony Coelho met with Secretary
Herman on this last week, and she was supportive in a vague way.
