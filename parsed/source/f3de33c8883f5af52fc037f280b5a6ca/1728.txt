TEXT:
I've looked into this briefly and think it's worth pursuing -- I'm meeting
with American Heart Assn. Friday. But I have no time to -- and I don't
think we need to -- come up with an administration policy on this by AHA's
conference next Friday.  If the conference gets widespread coverage, any
action we take within the next few weeks will still resonate.  I'd like to
put something together over the next month.  Let me know if that's not
acceptable.
