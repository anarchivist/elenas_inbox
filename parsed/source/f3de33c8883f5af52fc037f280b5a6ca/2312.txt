 TEXT:
 I am scheduled to appear with APWA and GAO on a welfare reform panel
 before the Appalachian Regional Commission from 9:15 to 10:00 that
 morning.

 My options are:

            1) Leave the EB briefing in your capable hands.

            2) Ask Diana to fill in on the Appalachian panel
 Suggestions?

 Ok folks, we're goin back to Texas. Virgina and Janet have the meetings
 going for Wednesday afternoon at 2:15 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., back to back on
 the Hill.

  Erskine would like to do a prep meeting at 10:00 a.m. Wednesday morning.

 Of course, if there is any new paper you think Erskine should read,       I
 would love to have it.


 THANKS.

 Jason
