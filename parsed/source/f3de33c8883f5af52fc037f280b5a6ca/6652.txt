      Subject: VP's Tobacco Forum

      Per your request, here is some information on the VP's tobacco forum in
      Boston tomorrow.

      The VP will host his fifth regional forum to discuss the issue of reducing
      youth smoking. We expect at least 300 7-10th grade students, their
      parents, elected officials and public health advocates from around


Massacusetts to attend the forum.

The VP will moderate a discussion with the young people and other guests
about the most effective ways to discourage young people from smoking and
the need for comprehensive federal legislation that meets the President's
five priniciples.

The VP will also show several anti-smoking advertisements currently airing
in Mass, and will preview a new advertisement with fashion model Christy
Turlington.


Special Guests Include:

Secretary Shalala
Senator Kennedy
Senator Kerry
Rep. Meehan
Rep. McGovern
Rep. Joe Moakley
Attorney General Harschbarger
Mayor Menino
Dr. Kessler
Cristy Turlington, fashion model

Other Forums the VP has hosted since October -- Tampa, FL, Waterloo, IA,
Cleveland, OH and Seattle, WA.

Also, C-SPAN is coming to cover the forum.

Please let me know if you need anything else.
