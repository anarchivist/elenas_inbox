TEXT:
I have read through the materials on Auto-Choice Insurance.  I have
long-supported no-fault insurance legislation, since my days working on
the House Banking Committee.  I believe the Auto-Choice proposal is
stronger, since no driver wouble be deprived of his right to sue.

If you agree, I would like to discuss this proposal with Mark Mazur and
Ellen Seidman.

Please advise.
