Chairman
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Goodling:

I am writing to provide you with the views of the Department of Labor
on H. R. 1381, the "Rewarding Performance in Compensation Act. " This
bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to exclude from
the definition of "regular rate," payments made to reward employees
for meeting or exceeding productivity, quality, efficiency, or sales
goals as specified in a gainsharing, incentive bonus, commission,
or performance contingent bonus plan.    The regular rate is the basis
for calculating overtime premium (time-and-a-half pay). As I
previously advised Subcommittee Chairman Ballenger in my letter of
May 19, 1999, the effect of this amendment would be to diminish
employees' entitlements to overtime premium pay under the FLSA.
Accordingly, if H.R. 1381 were presented to the President, I would
recommend that he veto it.

This bill would substantially reverse the FLSA's long-standing
overtime policy and drastically weaken existing protections for
workers to receive true time-and-a-half overtime premium pay.
Moreover, H.R. 1381 does nothing to guarantee that workers would
ever share in their employers' gains from their having to work
excessive overtime hours.

The bill would allow an employer to pay artificially low hourly wages
and structure a compensation scheme with "excludable" bonus pay that
is based upon production or efficiency, enabling an employer to
effectively transfer much of its risk to the workers.  The bill would
not guarantee workers the right to receive any incentive
compensation, but it would guarantee employers the right to exclude
any such pay from overtime.   Workers' only rights would be overtime
at time-and-a-half of an artificially reduced hourly wage, not their
true regular rate.  This bill would encourage employers to have their
employees work for longer hours at lower earnings, the opposite of
the original intent of the FLSA's overtime standards--to limit the
detrimental impact that long work hours can have on the health,
efficiency and general well-being of workers.



                                              Automated Records Management System
                                              HeK-Dump Conversion




           This bill would undermine workers' rights and the 40-hour workweek.
            These requirements, which have been in place for over 60 years,
           provide vital worker protections that discourage employers from
           having employees work excessively long hours and ensure fair
           compensation to employees for the burdens of working extended hours
           for their employer. The Department of Labor strongly opposes H.R.
           1381 because it is contrary to the best interests of the Nation's
           workers who would be affected by it.

           The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no
           objection to the presentation of this report and that enactment of
           H.R. 1381 would not be in accord with the President's program.

                                       Sincerely,



                                       Alexis M. Herman
