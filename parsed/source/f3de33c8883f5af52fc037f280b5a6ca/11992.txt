     The tobacco recoupment bill Rep. Waxman introduced yesterday allows states
     to keep all tobacco settlement funds so long as they spend 25 perent of
     funds on tobacco control and 25 percent on other health activities.

     Tobacco control is defined as cessation, counteradvertising, enforcement,
     community and school based programs, evaluation, research, activities to
     assist farmers and farming communities, and funding for a national tobacco
     use prevention program.

     States shall contribute to the national tobacco use prevention program on
     a pro-rata basis based on their share of the settlement for a) $500
     million a year to HHS to fund a national public awareness campaign; b)
     $100 million a year to HHS to implement the Surgeon General'~ 1998
     recommendations on tobacco use among minority groups; and c) $5 million a
     year for 6 years (2000-2005) to the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate
     regulations requiring tobacco product manufacturers that purchase foreign
     tobacco to maintain domestic tobacco purchase levels through 2004.

     Health includes but is not limited to Medicaid outreach and state
     expenditures for Medicaid expansions made by State plan amendment approved
     on or after 1/1/99.

     If you want a faxed copy of the language, email me back with the fax
     number you want me to send it to. Thanks.
