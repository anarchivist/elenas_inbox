TEXT:
The latest from Ashley Raines (Office of Administration) this evening:  in
an effort to decide whether NEC would build an office like the one planned
for Elena, Kathleen Wallman called Sylvia Matthews.   Now Sylvia is
deciding whether any construction should take place on the second floor
with respect to both Elena's office and NEC. Ashley thinks the CoS may
make the final decision.

Bruce:  it would be helpful for'you to call Sylvia and weigh in with her
on how important building the office is to you, DPC operations, etc.

The bottom line for now is that the construction is definitely off for
this weekend.

Of course, I will be keeping in close contact with Ashely on this.  If
there is something more I can do, please let me know ASAP.  Thanks.
