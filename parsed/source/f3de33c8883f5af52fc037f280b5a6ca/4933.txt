TEXT:
I've been thinking about this since you raised in Monday.     Here's what I
think the group has too look like

From Education:
Dalia Pompa, Director of Bilingual Education
Mike Smith
Terry Peterson

From WHo
Me, you, Tanya and anyone else you want
Sperling/Shireman
Mickey Ibarra
Janet Murgia
Maria Echeveste
Karen Skelton or whoever watches California politics for us


I don't think we need OMB in this, and I presume that COS office and Rahm
weigh in later, or whenever they want to.
