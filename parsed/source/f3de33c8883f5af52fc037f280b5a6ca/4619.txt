TEXT:
I have a long-standing request for Bruce to return a phone call to Gov.
Thompson (R-WI) regarding our position on FLSA and workfare. The Governor
called the President on August 4. At that time we determined not to have
the President return the call but rather to refer it to Erskine or Sr.
Staff. We have determined that the Thompson staff would consider a call
from Bruce as adequate to close the loop. Given our position on FICA and
FUTA taxes this will provide an opportunity for us to convey our message
clearly. We can not depend on others to do so.

Please let me know if you are willing to fulfill this request and if you
need any more information from us to help. Emily is out until Monday. I am
hoping this could be accomplished this week. Thanks.
