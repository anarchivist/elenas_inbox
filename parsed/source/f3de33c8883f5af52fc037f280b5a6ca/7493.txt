TEXT:


TO:                 DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
                    DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                    DEP. DIRECTOR FOR MANAGEMENT ED DESEVE
                    EXECUTIVE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR JOSH GOTBAUM

FROM:       OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:       MAY 6, 1998

,SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT

 ISTEA: Conferees met for 15 minutes this afternoon.  Shuster complained
 that the meetings on the House side which need to be happening in order to
 resolve the funding levels have not yet occurred; he expressed concern
 that the conference wonO,t be able to complete action by Memorial Day.
,The conferees then adopted a minor package of staff recommendations.    The
 conference will not meet again until next week.   Also today, House Ways &
 Means Chairman Archer announced he would vote against the ISTEA conference
 report (and declined to serve as a conferee) when Speaker Gingrich
 appointed Ways & Means conferees who are committed to extending the
 ethanol subsidy through 2006. Archer wants to let the subsidy expire in
 2000.

The House Science Committee held a hearing today to review the status of
NASA's Space Station program, and, in particular, the Administration's
response to: 1) A NASA commissioned independent report ("Chabrow report")
that claims the Station program is underfunded by $130 million -$250
million/yr, and 2) the continuing funding shortfall in Russia that is
delaying the delivery of the Service Module, a critical component for the
early assembly of Station. Witnesses included Duncan M09re (OSTP), Dan
Goldin (NASA), and Jay Chabrow (chairman of the independent cost,
assessment task group) .

'During questioning, Sensenbrenner was critical of OMB's statement for the
 record that additional cost growth for Station should be offset within
 NASA's budget. He was particularly bothered that human space flight was
 the area cited first for reduction, as he strongly supports this area. He
 asked Dr. Moore to identify specific offsets. Moore said the
 Administration would respond by June 15th, a deadline set in the recent
 supplemental, as to whether any additional funding is required for Station
 for FY,1999 and, if so, where the offsets will be.

 CONGRESS -- TODAY (5/6):
 SENATE:
 continued consideration of H.R. 2676 - IRS Reform Bill
         [SAP sent, 5/5: Administration supports passage, with modifications
         and has serious          concerns about costs]
 While under consideration, the Senate took.the following action on the
 bill:
 o Rejected (voice) Kennedy alternative amendment which would have paid for
 the bill by extending Superfund taxes.
 o Adopted (56-42) Roth amendment that allows taxpayers with incomes over
 $100,000 to convert their traditional IRAs to so-called Roth IRAs, which
 allow individuals to withdraw both contributions and investment earnings
 tax-free upon retirement.
'0 Rejected (25-74) Bond amendment that would have replaced language to
 establish a nine-member part-time IRS oversight board with provisions to
 create a five-member full-time IRS Board of Governors.

 HOUSE:


Passed (403-16) H.R. 1872 - Communications Satellite Competition and
Privatization Act of 1997      [No SAP]
