 TEXT:
 Dan Mendelson has a new idea of a fall-back on Hutchison: to add language
 enabling lawsuits on the federal portion of the Medicaid costs and stating
 the settlements to date were for just state costs. He's going to get the
 OMB GC to look into the legality and whether such a provision would be
 possible and likely upheld as constitutional if done on a retroactive
 basis.

 I would much prefer to have states devote a portion to youth smoking, but
 what do you think?
