TEXT:
FYI -- Lyn, Diana, and I are going to make a concerted effort to review
all welfare materials OMB is planning to send to the Hill as part of the
balanced budget bill.   We will pull together all those issues for which
we need your guidance (hopefully not many by now) and consult you all at
once.
