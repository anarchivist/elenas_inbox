Elena,

I am leaving for Phoenix early tomorrow morning.  If you give the green
light, Secretary Herman is prepared to announce the Youth Opp. Grants.  I
will have a skypager, so if you do decide that she should incorporate
something into her statement, just let me know.  I can be reached at
1-800-SKYPAGE, pin # 2168036 or at the hotel at 602/967-6600.  See you
Friday.

Julie
