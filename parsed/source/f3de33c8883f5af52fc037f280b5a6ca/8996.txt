TEXT:
The Vice President is on vacation this week, and will not be doing any
public events. Also, it is not definite that the President will do a
message event on Friday.   Currently, the only public event scheduled for
the President this week is tomorrow -- he is going to Andrews AFB to greet
the arrival of the bodies of the Americans who died in the bombings in
Africa.  I think it is a pretty safe bet that elder abuse will be
scheduled for Friday, but right now it is not.
