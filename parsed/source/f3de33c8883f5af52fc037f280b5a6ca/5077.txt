Subject: It's Official -- Kennedy-Hatch

I've heard that Hatch announced that he and Kennedy would be putting in a
tobacco bill before Congress adjourns at today's Judiciary Cmte hearing on
anti-trust portions of tobacco legislation.  It appears staff were taken
by surprise. Hatch sketched out some details including the use of an
industry licensing fee as opposed to a tobacco tax to raise the money.   He
asked the witnesses to provide ideas on anti-trust before the end of the
week so that he could incorporate their ideas.
Kennedy's staff were among those surprised by Hatch's announcement.
Kennedy's staff still maintain that there is only a 50/50 chance they will
introduce a bill before Congress adjourns.
