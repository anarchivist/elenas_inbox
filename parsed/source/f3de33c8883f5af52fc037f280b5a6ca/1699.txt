TEXT:
I think Dennis mentioned to you that I will be setting up a demonstration
of computer crime mapping technology. NIJ has offered to bring a laptop
and show us how the technology is used to track crime hotspots and analyze
the data so the police can better target their resources.

I will probably schedule this within the next couple of weeks so Jose can
attend.  If any of you are interested in seeing the latest in anti-crime
technology, let me know and I will try to accomodate schedules.

Thanks.
