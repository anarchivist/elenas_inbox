TEXT:
Elizabeth Newman in press is asking for the q&a asap.   Mike Cohen has
cleared. Thanks.

Why is the adminstration's proposal to hire 100,000 new teachers through a
federal program a better approach than the Republican proposal to send
money directly to the schools?

 The adminstration's proposal is to help local schools hire 100,000
additional well-prepared teachers in order to reduce class size in the
early grades and to improve student achievement in the basic skills.
Research clearly shows smaller classes and well-prepared teachers increase
academic achievement.

The Republican proposal is to use these funds for any purpose ranging from
buying more computers, buying textbooks, or taking kids on field trips.
Their approach has no accountability and offers no assurance the money
that is spent will result in smaller classes or higher student achievement.
