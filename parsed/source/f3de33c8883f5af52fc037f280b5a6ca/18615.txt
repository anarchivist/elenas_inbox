 TEXT:
 Elena,

 We should know by the end of the day today whether Justice is going to add
 the "would recommend veto" language to their testimony.   We will have
 until the end of the day Monday to review their language. According to
 Ingrid, Peter has given some thought to an accompanying Senior Advisor's
 veto threat.   Ingrid does not think that we need to make any decisions
 about that piece asap, but we probably should make our decision sooner
 rather than later.

Julie

Subject:         H.R. 1428 -Voter Eligibility Verification - HOUSE FLOOR ACTION

H.R. 1428 - Voter Eligibility Verification - is scheduled for House floor
action next week (probably Wednesday). H.R. 1428 would require the
Attorney General and the Commissioner of SSA to establish a voter
eligibility verficiation system to confirm the citizenship of voter
registration applicants. The bill also would permit election officials
to:   (1) require voter registration applicants to provide proof of
citizenship; and (2) verify the citizenship of voter registration
applicants through the system established by the AG and SSA.

The Department of Justice and SSA strongly opposed H.R. 1428 in testimony
before the House Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee on June 25, 1997. The
testimony stated that the bill may raise barriers for U.S. citizens to
exercise their right to vote and would require a cumbersome verification
process dependent on the SSN and databases not suited for determining
voter eligibility.

We are working with Justice to produce a draft SAP which will be
circulated for WH and interagency review.   Because this legislation is
clearly moving through Congress, SSA now wants to change its earlier
position of "strongly oppose" to "would recommend veto" (Justice is


 checking to see if the AG intends to join in the veto recommendation) .
