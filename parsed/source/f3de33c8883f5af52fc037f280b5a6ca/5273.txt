TEXT:
Did I behave well in Chuck's meeting?

I thought Chuck did an outstanding job in moving ED along, especially
since the ED position appears to be (have been?) that single sex sChools
are not permitted if they offer opportunities beyond what other schools
do, and just as impermissible if they don't.

At the next meeting, we need to make sure that we have a clear agreement
about what kinds of understandings and arrangements we can reach with
NYC--and need to capture that in a page or so that everybody agrees to.

I also think we ought to push for Riley, rather than Norma, to call Rudy
Crew and begin the next round of discussions.  We probably ought to
suggest that Riley invite Crew to come and meet with him for the first
conversation, with Norma there. And Riley ought to Crew that he should
feel free to call him personally if follow-up conversations appear to be
heading off track.
