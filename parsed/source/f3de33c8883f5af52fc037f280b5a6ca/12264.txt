RADIO ADDRESS ON ELDER ABUSE
DETROIT, MICHIGAN
April 17, 1999

        Good morning. Of all the duties we owe to one another, our duty
to our parents and grandparents is among the most sacred.   Today I want to
talk about what we must do to strengthen the safety net for Americal_J, s
seniors, by cracking down on elder crime, fraud, and abuse.

        For more than six years, we have worked hard to keep our families
and our communi ties safe. We have made remarkable progress, with violent
crime dropping to its lowest levels in twenty-five years.

        For elderly Americans who once locked themselves into their homes
in fear, the falling crime rate is a godsend.   But the greatest threat
many older Americans face is not a criminal armed with a gun, but a
telemarketer armed with a deceptive rap.  And our most defenseless seniors
-- those who are sick or disabled and living in nursing homes -- cannot
lock the door against abuse and neglect by the people paid to care for
them.

        AmericaD,s senior   citizens are especially vulnerable to fraud and
abuse -- so we must take    special. steps to protect them. That is why the
21st Century Crime Bill I   will send to Congress next month includes tough
measures to target people   who prey on elderly Americans.

        First, we must fight telemarketing fraud that robs senior citizens
of their life savings and endangers their well being. Every year, illegal
telemarketing operations bilk the American people of an estimated $40
billion -- and more than half the victims are over 50. ThatD,s like a
fraud tax aimed directly at senior citizens.

        Last year, we toughened penalties for telemarketing fraud -- but
we should stop scam artists before they have a chance to harm AmericaD,s
seniors. My Crime Bill will give the Justice Department authority to
terminate telephone service when agents find evidence of an illegal
telemarketing operation or a plan to start one.   This new law will send a
message to telemarketers: if you prey on older Americans, we will cut off
your phone lines and shut you down.

        Second, we must fight nursing home neglect and abuse.  Nursing
homes can be a safe haven for senior citizens and families in need.   To
make sure they are, we have issued the toughest nursing home rules in
history and stepped up investigations of facilities suspected of neglect
and abuse.  But when one out of four nursing homes in AmeriCa does not
provide quality care to their residents -- and when people living in
substandard nursing homes have as much to fear from abuse and neglect as
they do from the diseases of old age -- we must do more.

        My Crime Bill gives the Justice Department authority to
investigate, prosecute, and punish nursing homes operators who repeatedly
neglect and abuse their residents.  with prison sentences of up to 10
years or more and fines of up to $2 million, these new provisions make
clear that we will settle for nothing less than the highest quality care
in AmericaD,s nursing homes.

        Third, we must fight health care fraud.  Every year, health care
fraud costs American tax payers billions of dollars, draining billions of
dollars from programs that provide vital care to senior citizens.  As Vice
President Gore announced last month, my Crime Bill will allow the Justice


Department to take immediate action to stop false claims and illegal
kick-back schemes, and give federal prosecutors new tools to tackle fraud
cases.

        Finally, we must fight retirement plan rip-offs.   My Crime Bill
will toughen penalties for people who steal from pension and retirement
funds.  To borrow a line from Senator Leahy - - who is working closely wi th
us to strengthen the safety net'for AmericaD,s seniors -- the only people
who should benefit from pensions are the people who worked a lifetime to
build them.

        I look forward to working with the Congress in the coming days to
give AmericaD, s senior citizens the security they deserve. That is how we
will protect our parents and grandparents, protect our values, and build a
stronger America for 21st Century.

       Thanks for listening.
