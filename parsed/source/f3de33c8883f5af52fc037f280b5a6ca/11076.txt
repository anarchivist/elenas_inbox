MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                      Bruce Reed
                           Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                   DPC Weekly Report

        Health Care -- Medicare Update: The Republicans have apparently decided that for
the time being, they would be well advised to remain generally quiet about your proposal to
dedicate surplus dollars to Medicare. They still do not feel comfortable contrasting Medicare
with tax cuts and in 'fact, in a Ways and Means hearing on the budget, they did not raise the
Medicare issue. Your speech to AARP effectively highlighted this issue, but it is clear that we
will need to raise it repeatedly to ensure that it is able to break through to both the media and
the public. The four Medicare principles you released comforted the Democratic base, but
also succeeded in not alienating Senator Breaux. Senator Breaux has indicated that he
believes the Commission's recommendations will meet these principles and is also suggesting
that your comments raising the profile of the challenges facing Medicare have been
constructive. We will have to follow the activities of the Medicare Commission extremely
closely over the next few weeks, as its final reporting date is March 1st.

        Health Care -- Hearing on Disability Bill: On Thursday, there was a hearing on
the Jeffords-Kennedy-Roth-Moynihan Work Incentives Improvement Act that you
included in your budget. There is growing bipartisan support for the bill, which was
introduced on January 28 with 40 cosponsors, including about a dozen Republicans.
Senator Kennedy, in his remarks, thanked you for your support of the legislation, your
mention of this important issue in the State of the Union, and your other disability
initiatives (tax credit, assistive technology increase, and long-term care initiative).
Senator Dole, who also testified, made an appeal to the Republicans. He said that this is
about "good government" ~n response to the prevalent criticism that this is an
entitlement expansion. Tommy Thompson's Secretary of Health also testified in strong
support of the bill. It is slated for a mark-up in the Finance Committee in early Spring,
and possibly Nancy Johnson and Ben Cardin are planning to introduce it in the House.

       Tobacco -- Medicaid Recoupment: As you know, current Medicaid law requires
HCFA to recoup the federal share (on average 57 percent) of all Medicaid reimbursements
from third party insurers or Medicaid-related lawsuits, such as the recent tobacco settlement.
This week, a bipartisan group of 25 senators, led by Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Bob
Graham (D-FL), introduced legislation that would prevent the federal government from
recouping tobacco settlement funds. A similar bipartisan bill introduced earlier in the House
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                    2

by Rep. Michael Bilirakis (R-FL) now has 31 cosponsors. We have made clear that we
oppose the legislation because it gives up the federal share of the states' tobacco settlement
without any commitment by the states to use the funds to prevent youth smoking, protect
tobacco farmers, improve public health, or assist children. We are working with the Hill and
the public health community to stem support for the HutchisonlBilirakis legislation and at the
same time foster bipartisan legislation that would resolve the federal claim to settlement funds
in exchange for a commitment by the states to use the federal share of tobacco settlement
funds to support these shared state and national priorities.

       Education -- New NAEP reading scores: The Education Department and National
Center for Educational Statistics will announce next week small but statistically significant
gains in reading since 1994 in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades, according to the 1998 National
Assessment of Educational Progress. 4th and 12th grade scores returned to 1992 levels, after
a drop between 1992 and 1994; but 8th grade scores have increased since 1992. Scores are
up since 1994 for African-American students in 4th and 8th grade, and up for Hispanic
students in 12th grade. The report also shows that 8th and 12th grade students are reading
more pages per day, and that fewer students at each grade level are watching more than six
hours oftelevision a day, than in 1994.

        Service -- Americorps Event: On Wednesday, February 10, you will go to the
University of Maryland, in College Park to (1) mark the milestone of the 100,000th
AmeriCorps member (2) launch AmeriCorps' Call To Service Campaign -- an unprecedented
effort to ask young Americans to serve their community and country and (3) highlight the
$133 million increase in the budget to support 69,000 AmeriCorps members next year,
growing to reach 100,000 members per year by 2002. You will be joined on stage by over
100 current and past AmeriCorps members -- some of whom will share their stories -- at a
large youth-oriented Call to Service rally. The University of Maryland has a long history of
service and involvement with the AmeriCorps program, and the state requires high school
students to perform community service as a requirement of graduation.
