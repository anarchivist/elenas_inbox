Proposed edits to race book:

Page ill.4-3

First paragraph after third sentence, insert: "In some instances, minorities are benefitting most
from decreasing crime rates. For instance, since the early 1990's, homicide victimization of
young black males declined the most as compared to all groups. Hispanic households
experienced the greatest decreases in property crime rates between 1993-96, and the greatest
declines in violent crime victimization rates between 1995-96." This helps make the point that
overall crime going down is not only helping everyone, but frequently minority communities the
most.

Pge IDA-14

First full paragraph, replace third sentence with: "Today, we have nearly reached our goal of
funding 100,000 more police, and we have helped expand community policing to over 11,000
police departments across the country." This clarifies that we are close to reaching the 100,000
funded mark, not 100,000 on the street.

Same paragraph, final sentence: "And I have asked Congress to extend the program by adding up
to an additional 50,000 officers."


Page 111.4-15

First full sentence on page: "To fully achieve these goals, we should build on that foundation by
applying the lessons learned from community policing in other areas of the criminal justice
system, such as prosecutors' offices, our courts, probation and parole offices, and local jails."


Page IDA-16

Second bullet, first sentence: "To be eligible for this pool oftargeted funds, communities will be
asked to bring all the actors to the table ... " This deletes reference to "requiring" this
coordination, which is a much higher burden than required under current grants, and could
significantly delay the application process in communities that need funding the most urgently.

Delete third bullet, or at least the last sentence. Again, this creates an enormous burden to apply
for grants, and could have the effect of cutting off federal funds to those communities with the
most serious crime problems if progress isn't met by goals.


Page IDA-17

First full parpagraph, last sentence: Delete reference to "positive results needed to receive




                                                                           Automated Reeoms Management System
                                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

    continued federal support" for same reasons listed above'.

    Page ill.4-21

    First full sentence, replace with, "Many policing agencies are beginning to identify high-crime
    places through computer mapping ... " We shouldn't imply that the "best" law enforcement
    strategies necessarily require complex and costly computer crime mapping.

    Page ill.4-23

    First paragraph, last sentence replace with the following: "Brady Act background checks have
    helped to prevent gun sales to over a quarter of a million convicted felons, fugitives from justice,
    and others prohibited by law from buying guns. Promising approaches to build on this effort
    include increased seizures of illegally carried guns at crime and gun hot spots, law enforcement
    "tracing" of guns used in crime to the original purchaser to crack down on illegal gun traffickers,
    and prosecution initiatives to target gun-carrying felons and armed criminals." This takes the
    Brady Act --which we believe has been successful--out of the "promising" category and adds
    additional detail to the promising approaches sentence, including new reference to prosecution
    initiatives as recently highlighted by the President.


    Page ill.4-24

    First paragraph, first full sentence: "The result was an immediate decline in the number of
    juvenile homicides with guns in Boston for two consecutive years." This statistic refers to gun
    homicides, not overall juvenile homicides.

    Page ill.4-24-2S

    It seems that as we discuss the use of drugs and persons who commit crimes under the influence
    of drugs, we should promote efforts to increase drug testing and treatment for offenders under
    criminal justice supervision and the expansion of drug courts. Possibly add to the last paragraph
    on Page IIIA-24, after the first sentence, or as a separate bullet:

    "Studies tell us that the vast majority of all prisoners report drug use, and many prisoners commit
    their crimes to get money to feed their drug habit. We must do more to ensure increased drug
    testing and treatment for offenders throughout the criminal justice system -- prioners, parolees,
    jailees and probationers --- to help end the destructive cycle of drugs and crime.

    Moreover, we should look to expand alternatives to jail for nonviolent drug offenders, such as
    drug courts, that both promote accountability and responsibility, and provide essential drug
    treatment. Drug courts give drug offenders an opportunity to stay out of jail if they submit to
    drug testing, enroll in court-supervised treatment, and stay clean. Not only to drug courts
    provide closer supervision and more treatment than most other alternatives, they have also been
    found to be successful in substantially reducing future drug use and criminal behavior. We
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

should continue to expand the number of drug courts, which have grown from a handful to more
than 400 today."


Page 1II.4-26

Second paragraph, third sentence: " Since 1993, the number oflaw enforcement agencies
implementing community policing has increased from hundreds to more than 11,000."
