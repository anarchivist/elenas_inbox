Legislative Issues: The Labor-HHS appropriations conferees are expected to meet next week.
 In addition to securing adequate funding for your priorities, we are working to make sure that
the final bill provides the funding and authority to proceed with the national tests, and does not
contain the Gorton Block Grant provision. Our overall strategy involves convincing the
Republicans t11at they will pay a heavy price, again, for opposing your efforts to improve public
education. Your radio address and charter schools event on Saturday were key steps in that
strategy, and will be followed in the coming days and weeks by additional events we are now
developing, involving the Vice President, Secretary Riley, and others. We are also encouraging
business leaders and opinion leaders like Finn and Ravitch to help make the case for the Senate
provisions that place NAGB in charge of the tests. We are continuing to look for steps we can
take to reduce the concerns of the Black and Hispanic caucuses, either through adjustments to the
testing proposal or agreements on other issues. Our strategy on the block grant is simply to hold
tight; given the close vote in the Senate and the inability of sponsors of a comparable amendment
in the House to generate support, we think we can win without giving ground.

Voucher Study: Thursday's New York Times carried a story on a Harvard University study of
the voucher program in Cleveland. Though the story provided a favorable view of the voucher
program in terms of student achievement gains and parental satisfaction, the Education
Department's analysis of the evaluation study points out that the study examined students in only
two of the fourty one schools participating in the voucher program, and that these two schools
were better financed and in other ways not at all representative of the other voucher schools.
Later this Fall, the Ohio Department of Education will release the results of the      .
state-commissioned evaluation of the voucher program, which will cover all participating
schools. We do not know what this study will show.
