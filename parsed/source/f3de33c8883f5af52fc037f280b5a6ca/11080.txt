 PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
 REMARKS FOR ANTI-DRUG EVENT
 THE OLD EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING
 WASHINGTON, DC
 February 8, 1999

         Acknowledgments: VP Gore; AG Reno; Sec. Shalala; ONDCP Dir. Gen. McCaffrey
   Jessica Hulsey [HULL-see]; Rhode Island AG Sheldon Whitehouse.


        I want to start by thanking Jessica Hulsey for sharing her story.
Just finding the courage and strength to survive and even thrive in a home
where drugs -- not parents -- are in control is remarkable.    But your
commitment to make sure that no other child has to live through the fear
and uncertainty you endured is an inspiration for us all.   You are a truly
exceptional young woman, and I thank you for being here today.

        I know from my own experience what it feels like to have a family
member caught in the deadly grip of drugs.  My own brother nearly died of
a cocaine addiction -- and I have asked myself hundreds of times why I
didnD,t see it -- and what I could have done to stop it if I had.  I know
that my experience is not unique -- that thousands of families suffer
through that nightmare of powerlessness and frustration.

        But one of the most important things that JessicaD,s story and the
ads from our media campaign teach us is that we do have the power to fight
drugs.  If each of us takes action, at every level of government, in every
community, in every house of faith, and in every home ... if we reach out
to our young people -- as parents, mentors, and peers -- before drug
dealers reach them ... if we join forces, united and relentless in our
determination to win this war, we can make our nation stronger than ever
in the 21st Century.

        For years, it seemed that crime was an insurmountable and ever-increasing
problem. But we put in place a tough, smart anti-crime plan, with police,
tougher punishment, and better prevention.  Six years later, we know that
our strategy is working -- beyond our expectations. Around the country,
in cities large and small, crime is down to its lowest rates in 25 years.

        We are beginning to win the war against crime, and we can win the
war against drugs -- by marshaling the forces and resources of our
nation.  Year after year, my administration has secured the largest
anti-drug budgets in history, with more money for drug enforcement agents,
for border and customs control, for education and outreach, for treatment
and prevention. Under the leadership of General Barry McCaffrey at the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, our efforts have begun to pay
off. Overall drug use by adults has dropped to more than half of its
highest levels in 1979. Even drug use by our young people -- which seemed
to be getting worse every year -- has finally begun to decline.

        But when drug dealers still roam our streets and rob our children
of their dreams, when drug-related crime still ravages our neighborhoods,
we know we must do more. With our economy the strongest in a generation
and our confidence rising, we have a rare opportunity -- and an obligation
-- to redouble our efforts in the war against drugs.

        We must start by recognizing that our nationD,s drug problem was
not born in isolation and does not exist in a vacuum.  It is an
interconnected problem -- so our solutions must also be interconnected.

        To deal with the drug problem, we need to do more to expand opportunity
and create jobs for young people, especially in communities that have too
often been passed by in good times.  That means bringing the spark of
enterprise to inner cities, with more tax incentives for businesses and
investors, and expanded credit for low-income entrepreneurs.  It means s
trengthening the summer jobs programs that help so many young people build
a brighter future.

        To deal with the drug problem, we need to do more to improve our schools
and help all of our students to reach high standards. We need more


  afterschool and summer school programs to keep young people learning in
  the classroom in the hours between when school lets out and parents come
  home from work -- the hours when young people are more likely to fall prey
  to drugs.

          And to deal with the drug problem, we need a comprehensive anti-drug
  effort that fights drugs on every front and uses every weapon we possess.

          That is why I am so pleased to release our 1999 National Drug
  Control Strategy. This is not a short-term plan designed to produce
  short-lived results.  It is a comprehensive, long-term strategy, with more
  money for drug testing and treatment ... better drug-law enforcement in
  our communities and better drug control on our borders ... and better
  anti-drug education for young people, including our media campaign.

         And our plan is backed by the largest anti-drug budget ever
 presented to the Congress: My balanced budget for 2000 -- the first budget
 of the 21st Century -- includes nearly $18 billion to keep drugs away from
 our borders, off of our streets, and out of our childrenO,s reach.

         I want to say a special word about our National Youth Anti-Drug Media
 Campaign.  We launched this campaign last year because we knew that when
 it comes to fighting drugs, attitudes drive actions.  Young people who
 understand the damage drugs can do to their lives -- and the lives of the
 people they love -- are simply less likely to use them.

         since we kicked off the campaign in July, we have reached
 literally millions of young people with a powerful message: drugs are
 illegal, drugs are wrong, and drugs can kill you.  Although it is too
 early to fully measure our success, we are seeing evidence that our
 anti-drug message is getting through. And with ads in 10 languages, we
 are reaching young people of every ethnicity and national origin.

         One big reason for this success is the remarkable response of the private
 sector to my challenge to join our fight against drugs.  In six months,
 our campaign has generated more than $165 million in matching
 contributions for paid anti-drug ads. Virtually every major network has
 produced high profile anti-drug public service announcements with their
 best known celebrities -- you just saw a few of those -- and donated air
 time to scores of non-profit organizations for their own anti-drug PSAs.

         I am very proud of everything we are doing -- especially at the
 ONDCP -- to fight drugs.  But making our anti-drug strategy work is not a
 job for just one agency, but for every agency, 365 days of the year.  That
 is why I have called on my Cabinet to redouble their efforts in our fight
 against drugs.

          I have asked Education Secretary Riley to build on our efforts to keep
 our schools safe, by strengthening the Safe and Drug Free Schools
 initiative, and encouraging more school districts to start afterschool
 programs.

         I have asked Health and Human Services Secretary Shalala to help our
 young people stay off of drugs by increasing our efforts to promote drug
 treatment and prevention programs around the country.

         I have asked Attorney General Reno to push forward with more drug testing
 of prisoners and parolees, and more police on the streets of our
 communities, to break the deadly cycle between crime and drugs.  I have
 also asked her to redouble our efforts against drug trafficking by


  organized crime groups.

          I have asked Transportation Secretary Slater to maintain the vigorous
  maritime interdiction operations against drug traffickers that are such an
  important part of our supply-side anti-drug strategy.

          I have asked Treasury Secretary Rubin to step up anti-money laundering
  efforts and work harder than ever, along with the Justice Department, to
  keep drugs from crossing our borders.

          I have asked Defense Secretary Cohen to intensify his on-going efforts to
  use the unique capabilities of our military to support our drug law
  enforcement efforts, especially along our Southwest border.

          And I have asked Secretary of State Albright to continue our partnership
  with other nations -- particularly in the Western Hemisphere Drug Alliance
  -- to fight the global drug problem.

          Next week, I will travel to Mexico, one of our strongest and most
  important partners in the fight against drugs. A major portion of the
  drugs that come into our country come through Mexico, across the 2,000
  mile border we share.   This illegal drug trade endangers Mexicans and
  Americans -- and it is in our nationsD, mutual interest to work together
  to shut it down.

           The Alliance Against Drugs that President Zedillo and I adopted
  together in 1997 is beginning to make progress -- and I am committed to
  building on that progress, sharing resources, information, and
  experience.    I am very pleased that last Thursday, the Mexican government
  announced it will be spending $400 to $500 million over three years to buy
  new planes, ships, radar and law enforcement equipment.   I look forward to
  discussing ways we can extend our cooperation when I meet with President
  Zedillo.

          Our battle against drugs is a fight to the finish -- and it is not
  a job for government alone. It will take all of our efforts and energy,
  all of our courage and compassion.  It will take everyone of us, looking
  ahead to a day when the scourge of drugs no longer threaten our children,
  our communities, or our collective future.   I believe that we will reach
  that day, working together, and I look forward to working with all of you
  to build a stronger nation for the 21st Century.

          Thank you.
