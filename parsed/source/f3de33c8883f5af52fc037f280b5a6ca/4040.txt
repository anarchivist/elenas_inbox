           Elena --

        Here's a heads-up to a heads-up memo we will circulate tomorrow.
Please call if you have questions before then. This will get some
visibility in light of the illnesses (e-coli) caused by children drinking
Odwalla unpasteurized juices earlier this year-.

Subject:         FDA Notice on Fruit Juice HACCP and Labeling

We are completing our review of an FDA notice announcing FDA's plan to
propose rules on both fruit juice HACCP and mandatory fruit juice
labeling. These two rules are part of a comprehensive program to address
the incidence of foodborne illness related to consumption of certain fresh
juices. I will be sending you a heads-up memo later today.
