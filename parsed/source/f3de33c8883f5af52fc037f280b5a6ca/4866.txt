MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                        SYLVIA MATHEWS AND JUDY WINSTON

SUBJECT:                     President's Initiative on Race


This memo provides events and announcements that we will make over the next 2% months.
Over the past few weeks, Erskine Bowles has convened White House staff and Race Initiative
staff in an effort to pull together planning and implementation on concrete actions. In order to
carry this out, working groups were established to achieve progress in these specific areas: 1)
Policy; 2) Recruiting Leaders / Outreach; 3) Promising Practices; 4) Hard Questions; 5)
Dialogue in Communities; 6) Living Report; and 7) Youth.

In the next few weeks, we would like to meet with you to discuss the goals and activities of the
race initiative. Our meeting with you will allow you to provide input on those activities that we
have planned.

OCTOBER

Promising Practices: By October 31, we will place ten promising practices on the web site.
This placement will be the start of regular po stings whereby promising practices will be added
monthly basis. By December 3, we will add fifty more promising practices.

North Carolina Racial Reconciliation Conference: On October 27 and 28, the Governor of
North Carolina, James Hunt, Jr., is hosting a conference on racial reconciliation. The
conference grew out of federal funds set aside for thirteen southern states that experienced church
arsons in 1996. On October 27, Attorney General Reno will address the conference and
highlight the Race Initiative and the importance of the Justice Department's work to enforce the
nation's civil rights laws, particularly those laws against hate crimes.

Secretary Glickman: On October 27, Secretary Glickman will give the keynote address at the
Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities' (HACU) 11 th Annual Conference in San
Antonio, Texas. HACU represents more than 200 accredited colleges and universities that
collectively emoll two out of three Hispanic Americans attending college in this country. Also,
on October 27, Secretary Glickman will address the 11th Annual Indian Agricultural Symposium
hosted by the Intertribal Agriculture Council in Chandler, Arizona. The Intertribal Agricultural
Council is charted by 84 tribes with a membership that represents 80 percent of all US acres
owned by Indians and Indian tribes.
                                                                     I-~\!kp\jmj) Conversion

Inter-Agency Youth Taskforce: On October 20, the first meeting of the federal agency youth
taskforce was convened at the White House. The youth taskforce consists of one youth
representative per Cabinet agency. The youth taskforce will meet once a month. The taskforce
members primary responsibilities will be to ensure youth involvement in the race initiative within
their agencies and reach out to youth groups on behalf of the race initiative.

NOVEMBER

WH Conference on Hate Crimes: On November 10, we will host this conference which will
be both symbolic--unequivocally signaling the Administration's opposition to and abhorrence of
violence against those who may be different from others, and proactive--bringing key
constituencies together to identify commonalities and possible solutions.

Pell Grant Policy: In mid-November, [NEC/DPC to add paragraph].

At the Table Discussions: On November 7, we will kick off"at the table" discussions hosted
by Cabinet and Sub-Cabinet appointees. Much like the effort during the first term on women's
issues, Presidential appointees will be encouraged to host At the Table sessions on their visits
throughout the country. This is a great way to engage the Sub-Cabinet, generate press and
promote dialogue in the communities on the topic of race. The information from the "at the
tables" will be compiled into a report for the President. Also, promising practices and
community leaders will be gathered and reported to the race initiative this way.

Challenge to Youth: By November 15, we will have prepared a letter from you and Dr. John
Hope Franklin that provides a call to action young Americans across the country. Attached to
this letter will be a "how to" action sheet. The letter will be targeted to community leaders, high
school and college leaders and youth organizations. As part of this effort, we would like to
conduct a White House briefing for members of the media who target young people through their
magazines, radio stations and or newspapers. (i.e. Rolling Stone Magazine, Latina Essence,
Ebony, VIDE, MTV, VHI, Univision, BET Teen Summit, Latina, Vanidades, Moderna, "A" ,
Flip etc.) Further, during the week the letter is released, we recommend that you dedicate your
radio address to his call to action to youth. We will use extra measures to ensure that college,
hip-hop, and specialty radio stations are targeted for the radio address. As a follow-up, we
would like to recommend that the Vice-President host an on-line Q&A. By the date the youth
letter is released, we will develop a sub-link to the White House website that will be devoted to
young Americans titled: One America: KEEPIN' IT REAL.

Website: By November I, new features will be added to the race initiative website that will
make the site more dynamic and engaging, especially in ways that educate the public about our
work and help people become actively in the Initiative. This feature will allow us to create a
national on-line dialogue, giving the public an opportunity to share their best Initiative related
thoughts and ideas with the rest of the country. At least five messages will be posted each week.
 Also, this website will include the Advisory Board Members with an on-going opportunity to


                                                2
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
talk directly to the entire American public. One member will be highlighted each week. After
this initial period, board members will be offered the opportunity short letters updating the work
and experiences they have had working on the Board. If the Advisory Board members are
interested, this feature could also allow visitors to pose questions to them for responses. Also,
we will add a "The Face of America" feature will post concrete, factual information (such as
demographic data and research reflecting attitudes on race) that our Policy Planning and
Research Division believes is important to our education outreach efforts. The information will
be updated weekly. A calendar of events that highlight up-coming Initiative-related events will
be added to the website.

Secretary Babbitt: Secretary Babbitt will serve as Chair if the National Congress of American
Indians that is being held in Santa Fe, New Mexico November 16-21,1997.

DECEMBER

Town Hall Meeting: On December 3, you will host a town hall meeting. By October --, you
will receive a memo providing options for the location and theme of the town hall meeting.
Generally speaking, this town hall meeting will be set up as a model meeting so that it may be
replicated throughout the country. Among other things, it will highlight what is working in the
community that the meeting takes place.

Corporate Group: In December, we will convene a group of corporate CEOs for the race
initiative. These CEOs will recruit other corporate leaders and work among their companies and
industries to engage in actions that help build One America.

Health Disparities: In December, we will announce a "closing the gap" policy announcement
on health disparities [Elena to insert paragraph].

Fact Book: By December 3, we will have developed a fact book, which will provide a the
positive and negative statistics in which the race initiative hopes to impact.

MLK Bond: In mid-December, the Treasury Department will issue the $100 savings bond
which will bear a portrait of Martin Luther King, Jr. This portrait will mark the first time that a
minority portrait will mark government currency.

Interior Discussions: Beginning in December 1997, Interior will be convening the first of six
panel discussions in targeted locations that will focus on the role race has played in our history,
its influence on our cultural heritage, and DOl's role in educating the public about the nation's
history in addressing race relations in the National Park System and the many other natural
resources, tribal and cultural heritage challenges that the DOl finds in its trust.
