Subject:         Re: POTUS statement Mon. a.m. on tobacco -- what should
he say re farmers? Call Cynthia D. 67871.

The President could say:
I am commited that this legislation protect tobacco farmers and their
communities.  Farmers and their communities have done nothing wrong.   The
measure proposed by Senators Ford and Hollings would preserve the tobacco
program and give these communities some economic stability. Keeping a
program also means that we will keep controls on the amount of tobacco
that is grown in the United States. If we get rid of the program, the
price of tobacco will drop, and the companies will make a windfall of at
least $800 million a year. So I hope that the Senate will look carefully
at this measure, and work for a proposal that protects these farmers and
the public health.   We need to break the impasse and get a bill that
meets both of these important goals.
