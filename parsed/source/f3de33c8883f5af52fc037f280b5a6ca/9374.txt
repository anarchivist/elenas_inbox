Medicare home health update. Following your direction, we have been providing technical
assistance to the Congressional Committee's of jurisdiction in their efforts to develop changes to
the BBA's home health care reimbursement provisions that the industry (Val Halamandaris)
feels are harming providers and their ability to provide quality service to Medicare beneficiaries.
On Tuesday, Ways and Means Subcommittee Chairman Bill Thomas unveiled a new and fairly
creative policy alternative that has some potential. It would raise per beneficiary and industry
payment rates and begin to moderate geographical reimbursement disparities. Although not
everything the home health folks wanted, Val (Elena: Val is a good friend of the POTUS and the
President asked us, as you will recall, to be helpful where we could) sent generally positive
signals about it. The primary problem with Mr. Thomas' approach, however, is that it would
cost $1.4 billion over 5 years and, rather than use Medicare program payment offsets, he now
says he wants his fix to be paid for with the budget surplus. Following on the heels of the
Democrats' strong vote against surplus-funded tax cuts on Thursday, we believe our Democrats
(and us) are likely to take a similar opposing position on the proposal's financing. Although we
might be able to sustain this position, it will place great pressure on us to help produce Medicare
offsets -- most of which are politically unviable. We will be meeting with the Democrats on
Friday and early next week to determine if we can come up with an acceptable savings package
and, regardless, how best to position ourselves on this politically sensitive issue.
