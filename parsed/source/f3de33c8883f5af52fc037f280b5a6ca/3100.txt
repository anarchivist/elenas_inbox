TEXT:
I understand that you received this information by fax so it's not all
new, but I thought I would send it on anyway. Chris has been calling and
I am interested in your availability for these projects. Where do you
guys stand on getting together tomorrow and Thursday?

Chris is keenly interested in getting together.   However, he doesn't have
much room on Thursday due to commitments with Urban League. He is
particularly interested in getting started on working with particular·
agencies (including CEA) , and would really like to have a good chunk of
time to brainstorm on the policy research!development workplan with some
group of people on Wednesday, at a time other than 3-Spm.   He says that it
doesn't have to be an exhaustive group; and he is happy to go through it
twice if everyone who ought to be involved can't make one meeting; and he
is happy to do it with Jose or someone else on DPC staff if Elena can't
participate.

I will forward his e-mail from yesterday in its entirety, but would like
to make some progress on this issue in particular.

Thanks.
