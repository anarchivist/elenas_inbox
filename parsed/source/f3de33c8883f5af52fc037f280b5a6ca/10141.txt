TEXT:
Chris -- Nicholas Wade, the NYT reporter on this stem cell/cow/human
story, called yesterday indicating he wants to do a follow-up story on
NBAC's response.  I stalled by saying I thought NBAC was still working on
its draft reply, but that there might well be some activity on Friday.

We could try to repeat the process that resulted in the positive story in
last Sunday's NYT   (maybe also give it to the WP's Rick Weiss). Wade said
as much that he felt his mid-week story fell short of the mark, but blamed
it on a Miami stringer.

Wade's numbers are: 212/556-4302    (0), L-~P~6~/(~bll§c==J (h)

Let us know how, or if we can help.
