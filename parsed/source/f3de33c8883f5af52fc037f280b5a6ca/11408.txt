TEXT:
Q: Was the President's comments suggesting that the Medicare drug benefit
not be given to "people who may not need it" meant to imply he no longer
supports a drug benefit that is accessible to all Medicare beneficiaries?

A:  Not at all. The President was reflecting that it is possible to
design an acceptable drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries that is
optional.  This would address the decreasing number of Americans who have
a comprehensive retiree health drug benefit who might not want to opt for
the new Medicare benefit.  Under such a design, the,drug benefit would be
subsidized to make certain the coverage was affordable and accessible to
all Medicare beneficiaries, and that it was made available through the
traditional fee for service plan as well as Medicare HMOs and other
private options.
