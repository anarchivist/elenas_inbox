Hi Elena,
I have faxed you this incoming (to fax# 61647) reo the Uniformed Division of the
Secret Service.  Per Jennifer O'Connor, you are the contact person for language
I could use to respond to Mr. Reddy.  Please let me know if your office can
provide talking points/draft/language or if I should contact someone else (and
if so who?). Thanks!
P.S:
No word on TEAM Act response?
