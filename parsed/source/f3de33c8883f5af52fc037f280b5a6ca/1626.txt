TEXT:
Elena: I thought today's meeting was an excellent airing of agency
concerns. The broader children's initiative we have been working on is
moving through final NSTC clearance and addresses the concerns of DOJ that
the definition in the EO should be broader to include child abuse, etc.
Clearly, research associated with the impact of child abuse and other
negative influences on children's physical and emotional development are
part of this larger initiative.  I would narrow the definition in the EO
further to address USDA and HHS concerns and focus the regulatory impact
of the EO on EPA issues (environmental contaminants), at least initially,
since that is where most of the concern lies.  please keep OSTP in the
loop when it comes to EOP clearance of the decision memo.   Cliff
