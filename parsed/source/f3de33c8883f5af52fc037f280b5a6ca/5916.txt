TEXT:
        As a follow-up to the Podesta meeting. I spoke wi Gerry Shea he is
prepared to have a dialogue about this issue and will pull together a very
small group of labor policy people to engage on the is·sue and discuss
options/principles etc.   I informed Sec Herman we would be moving ahead
and she wil·l send someone to the meeting.  I will try for next week.
