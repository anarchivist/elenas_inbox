TEXT:
Elena,
INS agrees that VAWA self-petitioners are exempt from the public charge
analysis. According to AYUDA there is misunderstanding within the
community about this, though they could not say whether it was
misrepresentations by district directors or just generalized confusion.   I
have asked AYUDA to determine which it is.  If district offices are giving
out wrong information, INS will issue guidance to clarify.  If it is more
a case of general confusion within the battered immigrant community, INS
will send a letter (in response to an inquiry by AYUDA) clarifying the
correct interpretation of the statute.
