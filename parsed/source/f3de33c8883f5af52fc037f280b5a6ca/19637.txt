 This sounds like a good idea to me -- congratulating IOC/OSOC for their
 action - positive way to make an antidrug, pro-healthy young statement
 --what do you think ?

 Olympics and Drugs

   The Executive Board of the IOC announced today a ban on marijuana and
 other non performance enhancing or social drugs.
  This is a huge step forward that will not only impact the Olympics, but
 also the entire world of amateur international sport (which typically
 adopts the Olympic rules).
  We should make a strong statement in support of this effort of the IOC
 and the USOC, which has been a true leader in making this happen.
  The PresidentO,s meet with/remarks to provide the perfect opportunity to
 do so -- hitting strong on the values embody by sport, O&ensuring that no
 medal gold or other is tarnished by drugs.08

 Note
  The athlete who had the marLJuana incident is a Canadian; he is not
 invited tomorrow.  I have checked the lists to be certain of this.



  Double Bonus
   This would be a big blow to Gingrich who has hauled out the Olympics as
  part of his bash the President on drugs event -- a total thunder steal.

  Option
   ONDCP has a new Athletics Initiative that could also be announced --
  O&working with the leagues, coaches, soccer moms and Dads, and most
  importantly kids to use athletics to build values and send the right
  message to kids about drugs: Users are losers. Be a winner.UB
