TEXT:
I'm a bit anxious because Rubin has still not signed off on doing the
business group. He wants to make sure that they have a useful function,
but that they don't come back with something that we hate.  I told Mike
Fromman that I think we can work that out, and he agreed to make sure that
the group would be ready to be announced by the 23d while we continue to
hash this out.   Should I do anything else?
