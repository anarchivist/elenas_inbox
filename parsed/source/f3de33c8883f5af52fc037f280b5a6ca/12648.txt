TEXT:
There are several proposals in play to reform the Property Act so that
agencies will have the ability to sell excess property and keep some of
the proceeds, an ability they currently do not have.   Currently, if an
excess property is suitable for homeless. use, the agencies have to offer
the actual property to the homeless.  The proposals under consideration do
not retain the option to let the homeless receive the property but rather
permit these groups to receive 10 percent of the proceeds of the sale.
The homeless advocacy groups, HUD, and Democrats on the Hill vigorously
oppose any proposal that no longer permit the homeless to receive the
actual property.

The two main proposals are:   (1) a VA demonstration project that would
permit VA to sell 30 properties over 5 years and keep 90% of the proceeds
and give 10% to the homeless; and (2) a broader GSA proposal to allow all
agencies to keep 90% of the proceeds and give 10% to the homeless.

Everyone agrees that the current system for giving excess property to the
homeless is not as efficient as it should be (time frames could be
shortened, etc.).  In addition, there is a general feeling that there are
no incentives for the agencies to get rid of excess property because they
do not get anything in return.   We are currently in the process of trying
to come up with an Administration proposal that would try to take into
account everyone's concerns but still allow homeless groups the first
option to receive the actual property, but allow agencies to sell the
property in a timely manner.

The issue is that this week VA will be testifying on an omnibus bill that
includes the VA demo language, but that does not allow the homeless to
still get the property.   We should work to make sure that we do not box
ourselves in before we come up with an Administration position.
