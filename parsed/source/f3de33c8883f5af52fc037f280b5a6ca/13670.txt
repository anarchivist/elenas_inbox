TEXT:
could someone forward me the final letter to the Episcopals.
We've started collecting articles/editorials, etc.  If you have
any to put into the central list, please forward them as well.
By Monday, I will circulate a list of op-eds, editorials, etc.
with recommendations on which to respond to.  I also will send at
that point a draft for your review of a proposed standard response
that can be a starting point.
Thanks.
