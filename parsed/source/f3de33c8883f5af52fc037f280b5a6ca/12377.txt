                                         BEFORE THE

                  COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND THE WORKFORCE
                          HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                                         APRIL 27, 1999


I am pleased to be able to offer my remarks today in strong support of the President's proposal to

increase the minimum wage. For more than 11 million American workers, increasing the

minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $6.15 a hour over two years is not an academic debate

among economists. Instead, it is about paying the rent, buying the groceries, and keeping the

kids in clothes. Seventy percent ofthose who would benefit are adults, 20 and over. Three-fifths

are women, many of whom are the sole breadwinners in their families. Mr. Chairman, these

hard-working Americans - some of whom work 2 and 3 jobs -- deserve a raise.



When we last raised the minimum wage and expanded the earned income tax credit, we took

important steps to reward work and help millions of Americans raise their families with dignity

and move off welfare. Because of our actions, a full-time working parent with two children does

not have to live in poverty. But more must be done to ensure that all working families are lifted

out of poverty.



The minimum wage is not enough to make ends meet for many families. Working 40 hours a

week, 50 weeks a year, a minimum wage worker still earns just $10,300 a year. For these



                                               -1-
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
workers and their families, a one-dollar increase would make a real difference. It would mean

another $2,000 a year. That's enough to buy a family of four groceries for 7 months or pay for 5
                                                            ,

months' rent.



Opponents of an increase in the minimum wage overlook these benefits, and claim an increase

will hurt those it's intended to help. When we last raised the minimum wage, opponents claimed

that jobs would be lost throughout the economy -- especially in lower-wage sectors such as retail

stores and restaurants. They predicted that unemployment rates would skyrocket for teenagers

and disadvantaged workers. Some claimed that inflation would go through the roof.



The facts have proven the critics'were wrong. Unemployment and inflation are the lowest they

have been in roughly 30 years. Since President Clinton signed the last increase into law, over 7

million new jobs have been added. More than one million new retail jobs have been added, and

restaurant jobs have grown by over 270,000.



Unemployment has also declined significantly over the same period. The unemployment rate

for African-Americans has dropped froni 10.6% to 8.1 %. Unemployment for Hispanics is at a

record low of5.8% -- down from 8.3% in September 1996. For high school dropouts,

unemployment dropped from 8.2% to 6.1 % -- another record low. Teenage unemployment

declined from 15.7% to 14.3%, while African-American teen unemployment went from 33% to

31%.




                                               -2-
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
Employment has increased dramatically as well. Employment among African-American women

has risen from 57.2% to 60.9%. And employment for welfare recipients and single mothers with

children is continuing to climb, at least partly because of policies that "make work pay" such as a

higher minimum wage.



Some critics claim that these employment increases might have been even greater in the absence

of the minimum wage increases, but it is hard to take these claims seriously. Many surveys of

employers currently show that, instead of facing pools of qualified applicants whom they refuse

to hire, they are having difficulty finding applicants to fill jobs that they've already created.   This

simply doesn't fit the picture of an economy in which moderate increases in the minimum wage

have led to fewer jobs and lost employment opportunities.




The minimum wage increase would help, not hurt, poor families. Most studies show that

minimum wage increases disproportionately benefit workers in low-income families. While a

majority of those who earn' the minimum wage live in families with incomes above the poverty

line, these incomes are often below the average level of family income in the United States. An

increase in the minimum wage would therefore help a wide range of families with low-wage

workers who need a raise.



Mr. Chairman, we know who will benefit from this bill. We see minimum wage workers every

day when we buy a cup of coffee on the way to work.          We see them cleaning our offices as we            I
                                                  -3-
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
leave. We see them as we pick up our children from the child care center, or visit our parents in

the nursing home. Our nation's extraordinary prosperity rests on the efforts of all these workers.

 They deserve to be treated with dignity. They deserve a fair share of our prosperity. They

deserve an increase in the minirimm wage, and I urge you to adopt the President's proposal.




                                               -4-
