TEXT:
Steve held a productive meeting today on the interim verification
of citizenship status guidance that DOJ will be issuing -
hopefully by the end of the year.
There will be follow-up meetings on Tuesday on a couple of key
questions and Steve will really need the input of some of you at
that time -- particularly around the charitable organization
exemption and the definition of "federal public benefit."
He will get back to you about exact meeting times.
On Means Tested Benefits -- it appears DOL has signed off on the
HHS letter. but we were now told that apparently SSA has yet to

COO off    Ihey o;Wl tiM"   "";.,:~   ,"",   by ,.","'"   o.   ":J
Next steps: SSA signs off; Letter goes to DOJ; DOJ approves.
THEN -- DOJ is drafting language that will be available Tuesday to
go in this document. We need all of you to look at that language
closely.
AND OMB has committed to compiling the list of programs that would
count as means tested benefits to bring on Tuesday as well.   KEN:
We have to have a discussion over whether that list should go in
the document or not.

I hope this is all clear. Please call me or Steve if not.              Please
try to come to the Tuesday meetings so we can get this all
finalized by the end of the year.
Thanks.
