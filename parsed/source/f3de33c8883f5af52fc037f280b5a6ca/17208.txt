EARLIER THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED THAT THE INCOME OF THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY HAS
INCREASED NEARLY $2,200 SINCE 1993, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION SINCE PRESIDENT CLINTON
TOOK OFFICE, THE PRIVATE SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY HAS GROWN 3.6 PERCENT PER YEAR AND
BUSINESS INVESTMENT HAS GROWN BY 11 PERCENT PER YEAR -- THE FASTEST FOR ANY
ADMINISTRATION SINCE KENNEDY WAS PRESIDENT.       THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE
ROBUST GROWTH, STRONG INVESTMENT, AND LOW INFLATION

EXPERTS AGREE THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONG:
·   Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, 7/22/97: "The recent perfonnance of the economy,
    characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional--and better than most anticipated."
·   David Berson, chief economist, Fannie Mae, 6/14/97: "What we have now is the best combination of
    sustained growth and low inflation that we have had in at least a decade."
·   Fortune, 6/9/97: "Business is booming, inflation is falling, jobs are plentiful, and American industry is way out
    in front. The U.S. economy is stronger than it's ever been before."
·   Business Week, 5/19/97: "Clinton's 1993 budget cuts, which reduced projected red ink by more than $400 billion
    over five years, sparked a major drop in interest rates that helped boost investment in all the equipment and
I systems that brought forth the New Age economy of technological innovation and rising productivity."
