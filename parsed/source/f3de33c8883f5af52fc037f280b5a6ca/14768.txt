Hatch and Hyde have scheduled a joint Judiciary hearing on "Partial-birth" for
next tuesday at 9:30.  They've tentatively set-up two panels: advocates and
medical types.  This is a complete sneak attack.  The R's sent letters to
groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood asking them to testify and also asking
them to product and "public documents" they diseeminated about the procedure.

Kennedy's staff wants us to provide the CDC numbers on abortions.
Leahy's staff has gone back to Hatch's folks making "process" arguments about
how unfair and unilteral this thing has been.
