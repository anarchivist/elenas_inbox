                While we have not made a final determination on scoring, we believe that
                the Federal share of savings from such a provision may be about $15
                million in FY99. More on this to follow.

                Proposed position

                The amendment sets a dangerous precedent for the selective choosing of
                drugs that can be covered by Medicaid.  For instance, states may try to
                extend such language to exclude coverage of protease inhibitors for AIDS
                treatment.  Many states were initially resistant to covering this drug
                because of its costs.

                The Secretary currently has the authority to limit coverage of Viagra if
                the use of the drug is subject to clinical abuse or inappropriate use.
                Thus, under current law, should research show the drug is being used
                inappropriately, the Secretary can limit its availability. We can and
                would use this authority if we get evidence that Viagra is being used
                inappropriately.

                States currently have broad latitude to limit the use of these drugs under
                federal law through drug utilization review and prior authorization
                programs. They use this authority frequently (e.g., for drugs prone to
                abuse, such as human growth hormone) .
