TEXT:
Title X family planning seems to be in fairly good shape.       First, the
history:

FY98 Enacted      FY99 Request     FY99 Enacted
   $203 mil             $218 mil         $215 mil

This year's OMB/HHS budget negotiations:

FYOO HHS Request           FYOO Passback
           $253 mil                          $230 mil

While OMB did not grant HHS its full requested increase for Title X, the
passback does represent a 7 percent increase over the FY99 enacted level
and the same dollar increase ($15 million) that we requested for FY99.
HHS has not appealed the passback -- in large measure because the Health
Resources and Services Administration (HERSA), which administers Title X,
was cut in other, unrelated areas.  In fact, Ryan White and family
planning were the only two HERSA programs that were given any increase in
passback.  HHS/HERSA plans to spend any Title X increase in three areas:
(1) augmenting current programs; (2) targeting adolescents before they
become sexually active, and (3) strengthening male responsibility.

I understand that ~ylvia Mathews met with the women's groups the day after
passback, and the women's groups were already aware of the passback'
level. While they did press Sylvia for a larger increase for family
planning, they were pleased with our continued commitment to increasing
the program.
