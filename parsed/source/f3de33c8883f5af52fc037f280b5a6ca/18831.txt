TEXT:
I'm being asked by L.A. Times for our stand on the various proposals to
make it more difficult to vote, such as requirements to show a social
security card or other id, ending motor voter or mail-in registration --
sponsors include Tauzin, Horn.  Where do I go for this? Is there a piece
of paper? what's status? do we have any SAPs?
