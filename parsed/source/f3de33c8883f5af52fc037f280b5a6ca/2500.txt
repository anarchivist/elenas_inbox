2pm is fine for the interagency meeting -- I'll set it for 2pm on Tuesday,

2/18.



Also, we're setting up a meeting on the elusive HHS adoption report for

tomorrow     internal WH meeting at 5: OOpm (rm 100), .with HHS folks joining

us

at 5:30pm, so that we can give them united WH comment.    I'll have Olivia

fax

the report to me when it's ready today and have copies walked around to

the

usual suspects.
