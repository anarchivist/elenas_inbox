TEXT:
We met yesterday with Rahm, Gene, Barbara Chow, and SSA on a possible
radio address on stopping fraud in benefit payments to prisoners. We
agreed that there is some potential in announcing that other agencies
(USDA, maybe VA and others) will take advantage of SSA's big new database
of prisoners to spot prisoners who are getting benefits. We will work
with OMB to survey agencies for programs where this might work.  SSA notes
Shaw is doing an oversight hearing on SSI fraud this month and that there
will be a lot of heat from Congress in coming weeks on fraud, so this
would let us take the offensive a bit.
