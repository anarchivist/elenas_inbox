Subject: Request for Photo Op with POTUS and Miss America

I am putting together a request for a photo opportunity with the President
and Miss America for October 9th or 10th. Traditionally, Miss America
kicks off her agenda in Washington and will be involved in a series of
events with Congress and community folks on the 8th and 9th.  Since the
platform of the new Miss America is AIDS, we have been asked to facilitate
a brief photo op.

We would like to add your name to the list of requestors for this brief (5
minute) event.  Is that acceptable?

Thanks,

Todd
