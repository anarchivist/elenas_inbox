TEXT:
Should we submit a scheduling proposal for the school safety event that is
updated to include the newest report? If so, do you want to specifically
push for either:   event on the 19th, the top of POTUS press conference on
the 20th, or the radio address on the 21st. (Ann's note attached argues
against the 21st, so I think we need to come up with a specific proposal.)
What do you think?

Sounds like a very good event --the problem may be time because that week
is so crowded.   Is the 19th a possibility??
    As for the radio address: Because the 21st is the first Pew Conference
on Americans Discuss Social Security and the President will do a live
satellite address to them -- essentially kicking off the dialogue about
social security -- we have been assuming that this should be the theme of
the radio address .Otherwise we would really be competing with ourselves
to make news.
    Another option: We will also be looking for ways to make news during
the Africa trip.   If the timing'does not work out ,is this something that
could be released the last week of March -- with the VP ?
