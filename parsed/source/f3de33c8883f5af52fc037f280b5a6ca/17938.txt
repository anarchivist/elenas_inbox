TEXT:
In response to your question, we had a meeting with immigration groups on
Nov. 21 to discuss enforcement issues. We will be meeting with groups
again this Thursday at 2:00pm to discuss immigration services. There will
be some different groups represented at Thursday's meeting.   We have been
working with Maria to set these up.

I think our Nov. 21 meeting went well, and the groups were glad to be
involved. Maria mentioned that it would be good to have you at the next
meeting.  If you want to attend and the time presents a conflict, we will
do some switching around to make sure you can be there.

Thanks.
