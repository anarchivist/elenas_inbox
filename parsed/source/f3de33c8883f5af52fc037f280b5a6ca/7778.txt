Subject:         USA TODAY tomorrow

Here an outline of what Susan Page is looking at for her interview with
the President tomorrow.  Please provide guidance as it pertains to your
expertise.

She wants to write the best & newsiest story yet on Tobacco -- we have an
opportunity here to deliver great message and advance the story in some
way since this will reach over 3.3 million readers across the country.
Some of her questions include:

Q: The tobacco bill has encountered problems along the way. Why is
that?
       Who is to blame?
        Do you think the tobacco industry's campaign is working?

Q:  The GOP is trying to kill this bill, but what about the voices on the
left saying it doesn't go far enough?

On Another Issue:
Q:      will you now reconsider going to China?

Q:         If you go, will you raise this with the Chinese gov't?


Q:     What do you think about Gingrich's suggestion of a Select Cmt.?
