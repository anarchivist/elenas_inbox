?@<SUBJECT: -          Securities litigation reformD


?<Background

At the end of 1995, President Clinton vetoed a securities
litigation reform bil
1 that, among other things, limited
discovery, changed pleading standards and c
reated a "safe harbor"
for forwardlooking information.  Congress overrode the v
eto.
Concerned that plaintiffs' attorneys would bring actions in state
courts
that had been made more difficult or impossible in federal
court, during the Ca
lifornia Republican primary California
business interests attempted to pass ref
erenda that would have
instituted changes such as "loser pays." These failed.


The plaintiffs' bar, supported by labor and some parts of the
pension community
, as well as the California Democratic Party,
then proposed Proposition 211, wh
ich was on the November ballot.
Business interests vigorously opposed Prop 211
   The referendum
would have established procedural rules for securities fraud
suits in California courts that not only were far more favorable
to plaintiffs
than the federal rules, but that also applied to
any company with any Californi
a shareholders. Business interests
asserted this would have effectively overri
den the federal
statute, making California a haven for frivolous securities fra
ud
suits from allover the country.

On a campaign trip t'o California, which included a dinner with
representatives
of the high tech community, the President and
Leon Panetta stated (and were quo
ted in the press) that Prop 211
was a bad idea. They also said it was a mistak
e for each state
to establish its own rules regarding an essentially federal bo
dy
of law. There are certainly people in the community who believe
the Preside
nt said he would support a preemptive federal statute.


OOProp 211 lost 75% to 25%. And as Congress adjourned last year,
it passed a s
ecurities law reform bill that preempts state
registration laws for most corpor
ations and can be read,
aggressively, as preempting state fraud actions based 0
n those
laws.

?<Current state of play

In February, the SEC will deliver to the President a report he
requested outlin
ing the impact of the securities litigation
reform law.   Their preliminary conc
lusion appears to be that,
while it is very early in the process, the act does
not seem to
have had much impact either in reducing litigation or in
increasing
 information available under the "safe harbor."  It is
far too early to know th
e impact on potential litigation of the
1996 statute.

passing preemptive federal statutes particularly laws that
interfere with the
procedures and operations of state courts
is extremely difficult.  Senator Dod"
d made this point last fall
in wondering why we would favor preemption, althoug
h he thought
there might be a case for such a statute if Prop 211 passed.     We
u
nderstand that Congressman oxley (ROhio), who business
interests expected to sp
onsor a preemptive statute, has declined
on the grounds that it's unneeded, too
 difficult, and not the
kind of thing conservative Republicans like to do.  Som
e of the
California Representatives on both sides of the aisle, as well as
Cong
ressman Joe Kennedy, are said to be working on a preemptive
statute, but it is
unclear how far they have gotten.

We have been silent on the issue since the election.


?P<Recommendation

At a meeting attended by John Podesta, Bruce Lindsey, Kathy
Wallman, Elena Kaga
n, Tim Newell, Paul Carey, Dan Tate and me, we
 , .,

concluded that it will be ext rem
ely important to walk the fine
line between encouraging the high tech group to
believe that the
Administration favors preemption particularly the kind of
bro
ad preemption they have had drafted· and leading them to
conclude that we are g
oing back on what they think the President
had agreed to.   The attached talking
 points attempt to guide you
through the thicket.

             Talking Points for Meeting with High Tech Leaders
                 Securities Litigation Reform (Preemption)


     -Last time we (Leon) talked together about this issue, we were all
          concerned that Prop 211 would pass, potentially making
          California a mecca for securities fraud litigation under less
          rigorous standards than those in federal law.

     -Through all our efforts, that crisis was, fortunately, averted.

     -We understand that you remain concerned that similar efforts to
          establish minimal state standards that apply to out-of-state
          companies might appear in other states, and that fighting these
          one by one seems inefficient and counterproductive.

     -As the President and I (Leon) said, we too are concerned about state
          by state action altering what is essentially a federal system.

     -On the other hand, the securities laws have 60 years of history
          with concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.        Efforts to
          limit state jurisdiction, particularly access to state courts;
          need to be undertaken carefully.    They will be successful only
          if they are directly responsive to a proven problem, and only
          if there is broad consensus (which will almost certainly have
          to include the SEC) to take the action.  [Last year I s preemption
          of state securities registration laws in most cases is an example
          of a long-developing response to a well understood and
          documented problem.]

     -Now that we are not under the imperative that passage of Prop 211
          would have created, it is critical that we carefully work through
          the nature and extent of any state law problem and whether and
          what type of federal action might be needed.

     -We welcome the opportunity to work with you on this.  Kathy Wallman,
          who has been the Deputy White House Counsel and is now the Chief
          of Staff and Counselor at the National Economic Council, will
          be leading our team.
