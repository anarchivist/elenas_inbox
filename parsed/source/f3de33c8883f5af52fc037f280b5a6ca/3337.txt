TEXT:
Cynthia says some Republican staff on the Hill were very concerned about
when Treasury will be ready with their decision on EITC/FICA for
workfare.   She told them that we have been telling them to hurry up, but
we don't know when they'll be done.

Michael Barr's theory is that there is no reason to push IRS to go any
faster than their natural snail's pace, because it would be just as well
if this came out after reconciliation is done.  Let me know what you
think. One thing I haven't double-checked with them is whether indeed the
House approach definitely means no EITC or FICA -- it seems logical, but I
haven't asked the IRS to make sure.  I guess I should -- although I'm
afraid an answer will take 6 months.
