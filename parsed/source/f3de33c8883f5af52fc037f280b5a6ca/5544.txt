RE:           Asian Pacific American Leaders Meeting

The following are responses to immigration policy questions raised by Asian Pacific American
leaders at an October 16, 1997,meeting with Erskine Bowles. .

Q.     The final report of the Commission of Immigration Reform ("CIR") does not support
       family reunification of adult siblings ("fourth preference"). The groups stated this is an .
       important eligibility category and request that it be maintained.

        One ofCIR's recommendations was the reduction in the level of "core" admissions of
legal immigrants, plus a special program to allocate visas to the spouses and children oflegal
permanent residents ("second preference") to alleviate a backlog. In order to make these extra
visas available without increasing the total number of family-sponsored immigrants, CIR
recommended eliminating three other categories of more extended family members -- adult sons
and daughters of U.S. citizens ("first" and "third preferences") and siblings of U.S. citizens
("fourth preference").

       The Administration supported efforts in Congress for study and assessment of the fourth
preference backlog in order to determine an appropriate response in light of future immigration
and economic trends. The Administration also supported a suspension of new applications
under fourth preference while this assessment was underway, and development of an agreement
on an equitable process to "grandfather" those already on the waiting list whose petitions had
been approved. However, while the Administration supported the CIR recommendations
generally, it never endorsed the elimination of other family preferences in favor of second
preferences.

        The DPC is coordinating a review of the CIR's proposal and other reform
recommendations designed to improve the executive branch's administration of the immigration
laws. As part of that process, we are examining recent reforms made to our immigration laws
that could have a significant impact on legal immigration, and the CIR's recommendation in this
area. The Administration continues to support legal immigration reform thatis pro-family,
pro-work, and pro-naturalization

Q.     The group expressed concern that within the INS, there is no accountability at the local
       level.
the border and around the country, the INS and the Administration remain concerned with the
accountability of INS officers operating in local communities. The issue of accountability is an
ongoing challenge at a time of tremendous changes in the nation's immigration laws. As part of
the DPC review of the various proposals for reforming the nation's immigration system, we are
evaluating various ways to improve the accountability between field officers, district directors
and Headquarters.

Q.     Though we encourage naturalization, the groups were concerned that the process is often
       difficult and overloaded -- the standard wait to become a citizen is currently two years.

        The Administration is committed to the highest standards of integrity in the naturalization
process as we work to improve waiting times and provide more efficient service to citizenship
applicants. Prior to recent reforms, the naturalization process used an antiquated system, which
was overwhelmed by the recent enormous increase in naturalization applications.
Since 1996, INS has faced an unprecedented increase in citizenship applications -- receipts
historically at the 300,000 level annually had risen to more than 1.3 million by the end of FY
1996. This paSt May, INS undertook a series of improvements that will help guarantee the
integrity of the citizenship program, improve customer service, and ultimately reduce the backlog
of pending cases. These efforts aim to reduce the time it takes to complete the naturalization
process, from the submission of the application to the oath of citizenship, to six months.

        With the signing of the FY 1998 Department of Justice Appropriations bill, the INS will
receive a $211 million funding increase necessary to see these reforms through. The funding
will be used to reduce the current application backlog, to enhance automation, and to add staff
and other resources to continue naturalization reform efforts.
