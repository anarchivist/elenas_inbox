 Ray - a few comments on your points:
 1) The substance of the drafts really hasn't changed since our
 last meeting and wouldn~t affect what I understood to be a 15-25%
 estimate of the impact of the remaining salvage program under the
 rider. But I don't think we have any further info. on the effects
 in various reasons.   I did pass that request along.
 2) For reasons I don't claim to fully understand, it was in fact
 not USDA's intent to release while the Secretary was in the Pac
 NW; au contraire, they always expressed interest in getting it out
 before or after.    The reason I heard expressed relating to not
 wanting to take publicity away from the signing ceremony for Plum
 Creek Habitat Conservation Plan and other activities on the
 Secretary's agenda.
 3) On vetting - there are a few items I need to check on or verify
 today, both in terms of Congo staff and the labor call Jennifer
 wanted made.
 On the enviro front, we have vetted it with NRDC and the Sierra
 Club Legal Defense Fund.   Their view is that it does not represent
 the kind of significant policy changes that their community seeks


in the salvage program. Their first (rather unrealistic)
suggestion was that it be sent out as an internal guidance only,
since it seemed to them to reflect the kind of message the
President sent out almost a year ago and would essentially be an
admission that the FS hadn't followed that directive. Their
second thought (along with some suggestions for word changes) was
that it best be characterized as incremental step in the right
direction - management control - but that to get the enviros
excited and saying really positive things about this, something
would have to be added in the way of a real policy shift (like no
new roads.)  USDA is not comfortable with adding that component.
I do think the directive will do some on-the-ground good and
actually stop some sales that haven't been offered yet but would
be very controversial in, for example, California. But I don't
think the enviros will be issuing press releases praising the
President for this directive.
