                                      Q and A on Tobacco Taxes and Budget
                                                  January 5, 1998

        Q. Will your upcoming proposed budget rely on revenues raised from a tax on tobacco products,
        and if so how much money do you believe can be raised in this manner?

        A. I have said consistently that there needs to be comprehensive tobacco legislation with the
        primary goal of reducing teen smoking. We are making good progress in that direction. As part
        of that comprehensive approach, I have called for a combination of industry payments and
        penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50 over the next decade, as necessary to
        meet youth smoking reduction targets. These revenues need not be a tax, and reports that indicate
        that has been decided are wrong. I think it is fair to say that comprehensive tobacco legislation
        should raise some revenue and that we will assume some revenues from it in our upcoming
        budget.


        Q. Are the revenue estimates reported in the Wall Street Journal today accurate, suggesting that
        a tobacco tax would raise $10 billion for your FY '99 budget and $40 to $60 billion over five
        years?

        A. I won't comment on particular numbers that may still be in the drafting stage. The budget is
        not finalized and obviously hasn't been released. The projected revenues we use for the budget
        will be consistent with what I have called for in the past. I've said there should be a
        combination of industry payments and penalties to increase the price of cigarettes by up to $1.50
        over the next decade, as necessary to meet youth smoking reduction targets of 30% in 5 years,
        50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years.




                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
