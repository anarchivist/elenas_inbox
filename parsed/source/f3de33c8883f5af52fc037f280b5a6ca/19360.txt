TEXT:
The AIDS groups met with Kevin Thurm yesterday and they apparently got the
impression (according to several I spoke with) that Secretary Shalala is

Several of the AIDS groups are meeting over the weekend and next week.
They continue to be quite angry and are in no mood to wait.     On
Thursday, The President's AIDS Council will likely issue a resolution
calling for Secretary Shalala's resignation.

issue more closely to the Race Initiative:
