An alternative approach to the place of teacher accountability in "Ending Social
Promotion" and the larger accountability initiative for ESEA

Proposal. A "Quid Pro Quo" for teachers. In return for the substantial investments in
continuing and new programs that support teachers, the teacher role in student achievement
would be explicitly recognized and teachers would assume responsibility for their part in the
achievement levels of students. A similar structure for administrators would be required. A
parallel structure would apply to whole schools receiving ESEA funds.

o      Student achievement is th~ result of a host of factors, including some outside the school
       building (parental involvement, poverty, crime), and others in the classroom but outside
       the control of the teacher (supplies and equipment, safe environment, adequate
       technology), but one irrefutably important factor is the quality of the teaching.

o      Accountability for State, school district and student performance is becoming well
       established in the ESEA policies developed to date. Administrators would be at risk of
       losing administrative funds for poor achievement but also eligible for new money with
       their commitment to, and progress on, improvement.

       Students are at risk of being held back if their achievement lags, and when it lags, new
       funds (Federal in FY 2000; Federal, State, and local in ESEA for FY 2001 and beyond)
       would be available to help them get more learning time and special help.

o      Teachers need a parallel structure of sanctions and benefits.

o      Teacher benefits are included: increased recruitment spending, increased professional
       development spending. Sanctions are missing. They could be structured as follows:

       -- The State, school district, and school agree to accept ESEA funds in return for
       implementing (not promising) a teacher quality improvement program.

       -- The Secretary would establish minimum parameters for such a program, but it would
       be designed by each State, district, and school in accord with their own procedures, with
       full and open participation ofthe teacher unions, and subject to public comment and
       required response there to, before implementation.

       -- Teacher quality would not be judged in the abstract. Indicators would be devised by
       the grantees, but with the required inclusion of (1) the annual performance of students on
       assessments the system uses on a routine basis, compared with similar students, (2) the
       pattern, if any, of parent views, (3) differential performance among racial groups. For
       example, significantly lower performance of comparable students in the same grade with
       different teachers would be in indication of a possible teacher quality problem.

       Indicators would specifically compare performance of minority and LEP children to
                          Hex-Dump Conversion

         non-minority and English-native language children.

         -- Upon indication of a possible teacher quality problem, the program would require an
         immediate inquiry to validate whether a problem exists and to identify the causes.
         Factors external to the classroom would not be at issue. The inquiry would be conducted
         by the agreed upon combination of administrators, other teachers, and, if appropriate,
         outside experts. It would take into account such things as:

                the preparation of the teacher (e.g, was the teacher trained in the subject matter, or
                put into a predominantly LEP class with no training in how to teach them);

                the observed quality of the teaching by recognized strong teachers (e.g. a
                Board-certified teacher or school system master teacher, or other peers).

         -- The program would have a specific time frame for the inquiry, so that a teacher initially
         identified is fairly treated, and students at risk are helped quickly.

         -- If the inquiry reveals flaws that can be corrected (e.g., providing the missing training),
         corrective action would have to be taken and its effect demonstrated before that teacher
         could have full control over a classroom again. Appeal procedures would be required.

         -- If the inquiry reveals flaws not found to be correctable or which are not corrected after
         provision of appropriate training, counseling, etc., then action to remove the teacher
         would be required, with appropriate due process, in accord with the teacher contract.

         To ensure that children are protected, a teacher involved in this process would not be able
         to have sole control over a classroom, though the teacher could participate in teaching to
         the extent the program permitted, while awaiting the outcome of the process.

         -- Whatever the outcome for the teacher, the fact of identification of poor student
         performance would trigger immediate compensatory actions by the school, including
         additional learning time, teaching specialists, or other necessary approaches.

     o   This approach does not assume that there will be large numbers of teachers identified as
         needing help or, in the extreme, needing to be removed. However, as part of the State's
         monitoring of Districts (and their monitoring of schools), if no teachers are so identified,
         or only an extraordinarily few, the Secretary would require ofthe State a timely
         investigation of the workings of the program, with the right to conduct his own
         investigation, or if the problem seems pervasive in the State would conduct his own
         investigation at the outset.

         Discovery of non-compliance with the State/District/School program that was a condition
         of receipt of Federal funds, would trigger the sanctions of corrective action, past funding
         recovery, and new funds withholding.
