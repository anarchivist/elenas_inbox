   TITLE V -- AMENDMENTS TO THE STEWART B. MCKINNEY HOMELESS
                         ASSISTANCE ACT

                               Section-by-Section Analysis

        Section 501. Section 501 of the bill, 'AAmendments to the Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act,@ would set forth amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11421 et seq.; hereinafter referred to as the AAct@).
 Among other things, these amendments would improve the McKinney program by: (1)
helping ensure that students are not segregated based on their status as homeless; (2)
enhancing coordination at the State and 10calleve1s; (3) facilitating parental involvement;
(4) clarifying that subgrants to local educational agencies are to be awarded competitively
on the basis of the quality of the program and the need for the assistance; and (5)
enhancing data collection and dissemination at the National level. The program would
also be reauthorized for five years.

        Section 501(a) of the bill would amend section 721(3) ofthe Act, AStatement
ofPolicy,@ by changing the current statement to make it clear that homelessness alone is
not sufficient reason to separate students from the mainstream school environment. This
language, which is reflected in amendments that follow, makes a strong statement against
segregating homeless children on the basis of their homelessness. This responds to some
local actions being taken around the country to create separate, generally inferior, schools
for homeless children. Homeless advocacy groups and State coordinators have strongly
encouraged this action.

         Section 501(b) of the bill would amend section 722 of the Act, AGrants for State
and Local Activities for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth.@ Subsection
(b)(I) of the bill would section 722(c)(2) and (3) of the Act, reserving funds for the
territories and defining the term AState@, to remove Palau from those provisions. Palau
does not participate in the program since its Compact of Free Association was ratified.
Subsection (b)(2) ofthe bill would amend section 722(e) ofthe Act, AState and Local
Grants,@ to add a new paragraph (3) that would prohibit a State receiving funds under this
subtitle from segregating a homeless child or youth, either in a separate school or in a
separate program within a school, based on that child or youth=s status as homeless,
except as is necessary for short periods of time because of health and safety emergencies
or to provide temporary, special supplementary services to meet the unique needs of
homeless children and youth ..

        Section 501(b)(3) of the bill would amend section 722(f) of the Act, AFunctions
of the State Coordinator.@ Paragraph (3)(A) of the bill would amend section 722(f)(\) of
the Act to eliminate the requirement that the coordinator estimate the number of homeless
children and youth in the State and the number of homeless children and youth served by
the program. Paragraph (3)(B) of the bill would amend section 722(f)(4) ofthe Act to
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

eliminate the requirement that the Coordinator report on certain specific information and
replace it with a more general requirement that the Coordinator collect and transmit to the
Secretary such information as the Secretary deems necessary to assess the educational
needs of homeless children and youth within the State. Paragraph (3)(C) of the bill
would amend section 722(£)(6) of the Act to make editorial changes and require the
Coordinator to collaborate, as well as to coordinate, with certain currently listed entities,
as well as with local educational agency liaisons and community organizations and
groups representing homeless children and youth and their families.

        Section 50I(b)(4) of the bill would amend section 722(g) of the Act, AState
Plan.@ Paragraph (4)(A) of the bill would amend section 722(g)(I)(H) of the Act to
require States in their plans to provide assurances that local educational agencies in which
homeless children and youth reside or attend school will: (I) post public notice of the
educational rights of such children and youth in places where such children and youth
receive services under this Act; and (2) designate an appropriate staff person, who may
also be a coordinator for other Federal programs, as a liaison for homeless children and
youth. Paragraph (4)(B) of the bill would amend section 722(g)(3)(B) of the Act to
require local educational agencies, according to the best interest of the homeless child or
youth, to the extent feasible, to keep a homeless child or youth in his or her school of
origin, except when doing so is contrary to the wishes of his or her parent or guardian,
and to provide a written explanation to the homeless child=s or youth=s parent or
guardian when the child or youth is sent to a school other than the school of origin or a
school requested by the parent or guardian.

         Section 501 (b)(4)(C) of the bill would amend section 722(g)(6) ofthe Act to
consolidate the coordination requirements currently in paragraphs (6) and (9) and require
that the mandated coordination be designed to ensure that homeless children and youth
have access to available education and related support services, and to raise the awareness
of school personnel and service providers of the effects of short-term stays in a shelter
and other challenges associated with homeless children and youth. Paragraph (4)(D) of
the bill would amend section 722(g)(7) of the Act to require each local educational
agency liaison, designated pursuant to section 722(g)(I)(H)(ii)(I), to ensure that: (1)
homeless children and youth emoll, and have a full and equal opportunity to succeed, in
schools ofthat agency; (2) homeless families, children and youth, receive educational
services for which such families, children and you are eligible; and (3) the parents or
guardians of homeless children and youths are informed of the education and related
opportunities available to their children and are provided with meaningful opportunities
to participate in the education of their children. Section 722(g)(7) would be further
amended by adding a new subparagraph (C) requiring local educational agency liaisons,
as a part of their duties, to coordinate and collaborate with State coordinators and
community and school personnel responsible for the provision of education and related
services to homeless children and youth. Paragraph (4)(E) ofthe bill would eliminate
section 722(g)(9) of the Act, which would be combined with paragraph (6).

       Section 501(c) of the bill would amend section 723 of the Act, ALocal
Educational Agency Grants for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth.@
                                                                                    Hax.Dump ConverSion

Subsection (c)(I) of the bill would amend section 723(a) of the Act to: (I) make certain
editorial changes; (2) clarify that where services under the section are provided on school
grounds, schools may use funds under this Act to provide the same services to other
children and youth who are determined by the local educational agency to be at risk of
failing in, or dropping out of, schools; and (3) prohibit schools from providing services,
including those to at-risk children and youth, in settings within a school that segregate
homeless children and youth from other children and youth, except as is necessary for
short periods of time because of health and safety emergencies or to provide temporary,
special supplementary services to meet the unique needs of homeless children and youth.

        Section 501(c)(2) of the bill would amend section 723(b) of the Act to require
local applications for State subgrants to contain an assessment of the educational and
related needs of homeless children and youth in their district (which may be undertaken
as a part of needs assessments for other disadvantaged groups). Subsection (c )(3) ofthe
bill would amend section 723(c)(1) of the Act to clarify that State subgrants are to be
awarded competitively on the basis of the need of such agencies for assistance under this
subtitle and the quality of the application submitted. Subsection (c)(3) of the bill would
be further amended by adding a new paragraph (3), requiring a State educational agency,
in determining the quality of a local application for a sub grant, to consider: (I) the
applicant=s needs assessment and the likelihood that the program presented in the
application will meet those needs; (2) the types, intensity, and coordination of the services
to be provided under the program; (3) the involvement of parents or guardians; (4) the
extent to which homeless children and youth will be integrated within the regular
education program; (5) the quality of the applicant=s evaluation plan for the program; (6)
the extent to which services provided under this subtitle will be coordinated with other
available services; and (7) such other measures as the State educational agency deems
indicative of a quality program.

        Section 501(d) of the bill would amend section 724 of the Act, ASecretarial
Responsibilities.@ Section 501(d) of the bill would replace current subsection (t),
AReports,@ with a new subsection (t), Alnfomlation,@ and a new subsection (g),
AReport.@ New subsection (f) would require the Secretary, from funds appropriated
under section 726, and either directly or through grants, contracts, or cooperative
agreements, to periodically collect and disseminate data and information on the number
and location of homeless children and youth, the education and related services such
children and youth receive, the extent to which such needs are being met, and such other
