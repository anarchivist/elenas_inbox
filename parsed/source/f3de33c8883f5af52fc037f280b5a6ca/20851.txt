     TEXT:
     Elena -- remember that civil rights guidance HHS was trying to get us to
     clear? It might come up in this context.     HHS had a counter-suggestion
     to your language ... here's the text of the last email Diana sent you on
     the subject. What do you think?


     HHS had a counter-suggestion to our suggestion. Actually, I'm not sure
     it's so bad. HHS's concern about our suggested language was that it
     appeared too much to invite racially neutral criteria with a
     disproportionate impact. But their new effort is more positive than their
     old.  I think it's OK, although maybe I'm just getting tired. Is this OK
     with everyone?

     Intro:
     The Act imposes a 5-year limit on receipt of TANF benefits.  However, a
     state may allow hardship exemptions from the time limit for up to 20%of
     its caseload.

     DPC Suggestion:
     A racially neutral criterion that excludes a disproportionately greater
     number of minorities than non-minorities is permissible, so long as there
     is a substantial and legitimate justification for this criterion and there
     is no comparably effective alternative that excludes fewer minorities.

     HHS Counter-Suggestion:
     States should take care in establishing the criteria for allowing such
     exemptions particularly where racially neutral criteria exclude a
     disproportionately greater number of minorities than non-minorities.
     Neutral criteria that cause a significantly disproportionate exclusion are
     permissible, only so long as there is a substantial and legitimate
     justification for these criteria and there is no comparably effective
     alternative that excludes fewer minorities.


     [For those who want to cast their minds back, here is HHS's original
     version that we didn't like, FYI.]
     HHS Original Version:
     States and counties may not use a racially neutral criterion that,
     nevertheless, excludes a disproportionately greater number of minorities


 than non-minorities to determine who will be granted this exemption,
 unless there is a substantial and legitimate justification for this
 criterion.  Even if there is such a justification, this criterion cannot
 be used if there is a comparably effective alternative to identify persons
 who qualify for this exemption that excludes fewer minorities.

 Subject:         Follow up on NYT Story re: Minorities on Welfare

Just a heads up that Maria Echaveste dropped by our weekly welfare reform
meeting to discuss follow up on Jason DeParle story.   She said POTUS
expressed concern about the issue to she and Gene before the social
security event yesterday.  She indicated there was interest in doing
further analysis to find out whether the trends reported are true, and
then exploring strategies to address the issues--particularly increasing
proportion of Hispanics on welfare. Bruce, I know you already suggested
some data issues to look into, but I wanted to make sure both of you knew
there had also been discussion of possible initiatives. Maria mentioned
that she had intended to talk with one of you about this first --
actually, I think she was a little surprised to walk into the weekly
welfare reform meeting and find me (we hadn't met before) and people from
the agencies.  I'll talk to HHS about further analysis of trends, but want
to get your guidance before pursuing possible initiatives further.
