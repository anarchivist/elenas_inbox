                   THE PRESIDENT CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF EQUAL PAY
                         LEGISLATION AND RELEASES COUNCIL
                   OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS' REPORT ON THE WAGE GAP
                                     June 10, 1998


     Today the President will commemorate the thirty-fifth anniversary of President Kennedy's
     signing of the Equal Pay Act and will urge passage of legislation to strengthen the laws that
     prohibit wage discrimination against women. In addition, the President will release a Council of
     Economic Advisers' (CEA) report on the gender wage gap, and announce a Department of Labor
     report that provides a historical perspective ofthe wage gap. The President will be joined by Dr.
     Dorothy Height, President Emeritus of the National Council of Negro Women, who was at the
     signing ceremony of the Equal Pay Act in 1963.

     Legislation to Improve Enforcement of Wage Discrimination Laws. The President will call
     on Congress to pass legislation, introduced by Senator Daschle and Congresswoman DeLauro, to
     strengthen laws prohibiting wage discrimination. The highlights of this legislation include:

     ·.     Increased Penalties for the Equal Pay Act (EPA). The legislation adds full compensatory
            and punitive damages as remedies, in addition to the liquidated damages and back pay
            awards currently available under the EPA. This proposal would put gender-based wage
            discrimination on equal footing with wage discrimination based on race or ethnicity, for
            which uncapped compensatory and punitive damages are already available.

     ·      Non-retaliation provision. The bill would prohibit employers from punishing employees
            for sharing salary information with their co-workers. Currently, employers are free to
            take action against employees who share wage information. Without the ability to learn
            about wage disparities, it is difficult for women to evaluate whether there is wage
            discrimination.

     ·      Training, Research, and Pay Equity Award. The Daschle-DeLauro bill provides for
            increased training for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission employees on matters
            involving the discrimination of wages; research on discrimination in the payment of
            wages; and the establishment of the "The National Award for Pay Equity in the
            Workplace," which will recognize and promote the achievements of employers that
            have made strides to eliminate pay disparities.

     CEA Report on the Wage Gap. The President will announce a report by the CEA that shows
     that a significant gap between the wages of women and men remains today although it has
     narrowed substantially since the signing of the Equal Pay Act.

     ·      Gender Pay Gap Has Closed. In 1963, the year that the Equal Pay Act was signed,
            women earned 58 cents for every dollar men earned. Today women earn about 75 cents
            for every dollar men earn, a 29 percent increase over the 1963 levels.
                                                                          f~fex-Dump COnversion


·      But Discrimination Still Exists. Despite these gains, there continues to be evidence of
       labor market discrimination and a significant gap between men's and women's wages,
       even after accounting for factors such as educational attainment, work experience, and
       occupational choice.
                                                                    ·
Department of Labor Report Provides a Historical Perspective on the Wage Gap. The
President also will announce a Department of Labor report that provides a thirty-five year
perspective on the wage gap. This report focuses on three periods since the signing of the Equal
Pay Act -- 1960-1975, 1975-1985, and 1985-1997 -- and highlights the increased participation of
women in the labor force, the changing occupations of women, and the emergence of more
women-owned businesses.

·      Women's Labor Force Participation Has Increased. Women's labor force participation
       rate rose from 37.7 percent in 1960 to almost 60 percent in 1997.

·      Increased Contributions by Women to Family Income. Between 1995 and 1996 alone,
       the number of families with two. working parents increased by nearly half a million,
       making equal pay even more of a family issue. In these years, both parents were
       employed in 63.9 percent of married-couple families with children 18 and younger, while
       28.2 percent of these families had an employed father and homemaker mother.
