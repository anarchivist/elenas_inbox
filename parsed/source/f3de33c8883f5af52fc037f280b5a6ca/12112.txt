                   PRESIDENT CLINTON URGES PASSAGE OF
           HATE CRIMES BILL AND ANNOUNCES PUBLIC-PARTNERSHIP
                 TO TEACH TOLERANCE IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS
                                April 6, 1999

Today President Clinton applauded public and private efforts to teach children about tolerance
and urged Congress to quickly pass the pending federal hate crimes legislation. This legislation
strengthens the existing federal hate crimes law by (1) extending the situations where
prosecutions can be brought for violent crimes motivated by bias based on race, color, religion,
or national origin; and (2) expanding the federal hate crimes statute to protect against hate crimes
based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. The President also announced a new
pUblic-private partnership which will focus attention on issues of hate, tolerance, and diversity in
middle-grade schools. Finally, the President called on the Departments of Justice and Education
to include hate crimes in its annual report card on school safety and to report on hate crimes and
bias on college campuses.

Urging Passage of Expanded Federal Hate Crimes Law_ The President urged Congress to
pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, which expands a principal federal hate crimes
statute. The current statute prohibits acts of violence that are based on a person's race, color,
religion, or national origin and that are intended to interfere with certain specified federally
protected activities. The proposed legislation would make illegal acts of violence, even if they
did not interfere with federally protected activities. Further, the legislation would authorize the
Department of Justice to prosecute individuals who commit violent crimes against others because
of the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Current federal law does not cover these
cases at all.

Announcing Public-Private Partnership to Create a Middle-School Program about
Tolerance_ The President announced a public-private partnership that will develop a program
for middle-school students to teach tolerance in the classroom and in their daily lives. The
members of the partnership are the Departments of Justice and Education and AT&T, Court TV,
the National Middle School Association, the Anti-Defamation League, and Cable in the
Classroom. This effort is supported by the NAACP, the Leadership Conference for Civil
Rights, the National Council of La Raza, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium,
the National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems, the National Education
Association, and the National School Boards Association, and the Partnership welcomes support
from other organizations that deal with these issues. Recognizing that tolerance cannot be
taught in a singie day and that raising awareness of diversity should be integrated into students'
daily lives, this pUblic-private partnership entitled "Dealing with Our Differences," will provide
an opportunity for an ongoing dialogue for middle-school students to learn about the harmful
impact of intolerance and to highlight positive ways that young adolescents are dealing with
diversity issues. The Partnership will develop in-school lessons and activities supported with
cable TV programming; videos and websites; a nationally-televised forum on diversity and
tol\!rance at the end of October; and post-show lessons and activities.

Creating New Studies About Hate Crimes in Schools and Colleges.               In order to better
                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

    understand the problem of hate crimes and intolerance among young people, the President called
    on the Departments of Justice and Education to include in their annual report card on school
    safety a section on hate crimes among young people, both at and away from school. In addition,
    the President directed the Department of Education, with appropriate assistance from the
    Department of Justice, to collect data on hate crime and bias on college campuses for periodic
    publication.
