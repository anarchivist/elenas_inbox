TEXT:
What's the best way to get answers to these two questions:

1. Can private sources contribute to the regional. events?

2. If a private concern, like Lifetime Network, pays for materials or
contributes in some other way, what exactly do we have to do? (The
impression I got from our last meeting was that they are then co-sponsors;
but I'm not sure what that means in the way of our taking any real action.)

Thanks.
