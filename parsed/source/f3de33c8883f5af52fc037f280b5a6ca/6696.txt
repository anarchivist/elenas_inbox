Subject:         Aids Council Meeting Press Conference

A group of people want to do a press conference in front of the White
House tomorrow to ask for Donna Shalala's resignation, possibly to resign
themselves from the Council, possibly to engage in civil disobedience that
would lead to the arrest of some demonstrators.


Their is also a consideration to ask for Director McCaffrey to resign.
It would not be a long walk from the White House to our office) The belief
is that the Director is standing in the way of Shalala lifting the ban.
The group wants to put pressure on her to voice her support for federal
funding for needle exchange programs/research and to not be "squeezed" by
others (BRM).

"Bus loads" will be arriving in DC tomorrow as per the caller.
