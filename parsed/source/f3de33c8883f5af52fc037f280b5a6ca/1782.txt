TEXT:
I am going to tell her we have no comments.  The letter from Interior says
the Administration supports reauthorization of the Native American
Programs Act which funds social and economic development efforts, but
wished the legislation also included a reauthorization of the Native
Hawaiian Revolving Loan Fund.
