                the unnumbered Senate bill scheduled for markup by the Senate Finance
                Committee as soon as tomorrow.  The Senate bill contains objectionable


provisions similar to those in the 105th Congress' HR 2646, which the
President vetoed.   Education and Treas. have requested clearance of this
letter ASAP in order to send it out tonight. Appreciate your immediate
attendtion on this item. Thank you.

Education and Treasury agree on this version [5/18/99,4:00 PM], subject to ED review of
additional Treasury edits

Dear Mr. Chairman, [Dear Senator Moynihan]

We write to express our strong opposition to proposals for education tax incentives (Joint
Committee on Taxation, "Description of Chairman's Mark of Proposals Relating to Education
Incentives" (JCX-020-99), May 17, 1999), which we understand your committee will consider
this week. In the summer of 1997, as Congress was in the final stages of consideration of the
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the President stated that he would veto the legislation if it
contained a proposal relating to Education Savings Accounts that is similar to the education
savings account proposal contained in the Chairman's mark. In 1998, we wrote to Inform you
that we would recommend to the President that he veto similar legislation, which, after
consideration and approval by Congress, he did. If this proposal were to pass the Congress this
year, we again would recommend to the President that he veto the bill.

Every American child deserves a high-quality elementary and secondary education. We believe
that targeting our limited Federal resources to build stronger public schools will help ensure that
all our children receive the education they need to be productive citizens. Public schools serve
approximately 90 percent of students in grades K-12 and currently face record-breaking
enrollments. By focusing resources on public schools, we can leverage community investment
to help parents, teachers, and administrators meet the important educational challenges they face
in serving the vast majority of our children: meeting high standards for learning and discipline;
fixing school buildings; and providing a safe, drug-free environment for children. For this
reason, the President's FY 2000 budget proposals include a school modernization bond initiative
that would leverage $25 billion to renovate and build up to 6,000 public schools. In contrast, the
Chainnan's mark diverts needed attention and resources from our public schools, and it falls far
short of adequately addressing the overwhelming problems that States and local communities
face in building and modernizing their schools.

The current bill disproportionately benefits the most affluent families and provides little benefit
to lower- and middle-income families. Additionally, given the expansion of tax-preferred
savings vehicles in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we do not believe that further increasing the
contribution limits for Education IRAs will generate much additional savings. Instead, the
Chainnan's mark would reward families, particularly those with significant means, for what they
would do in any case.

We are also concerned that the bill would create significant compliance problems. The
legislation allows tax-free withdrawals from Education IRAs for, among other things, tuition,
fees, academic tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies and equipment expenses incurred
in connection with the child's enrollment or attendance at a public or private elementary or
secondary school. Withdrawals would also be tax-free ifused for room and board, uniforms,
transportation or supplementary items or services required or provided by the school.
Distinguishing between an appropriately tax-free withdrawal and one that should be subject to
tax would lead to significant additional record-keeping burdens for families and schools, as well
as disputes when discretionary purchases are made.

We, therefore, urge the Committee not to approve this legislation.

     We understand that Senators Robb and Conrad intend to offer a. substitute that would replace the
     education IRA proposals in this bill with school modernization/construction bond proposals
     similar to those in the President's budget for fiscal year 2000. We strongly prefer that proposal
     and other alternatives that devote Federal revenue to improving the public schools so that a high-
     quality education is available to every American child regardless of his or her family income.
     Therefore, we strongly support the Robb-Conrad substitute.

     Sincerely,



     Robert E. Rubin                      Richard W. Riley
