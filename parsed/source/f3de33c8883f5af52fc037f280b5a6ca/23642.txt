TEXT:
Irene and I just.attended a conference call with OMB, HHS-ASMB,
HHS-ACF-Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to discuss the process
both in terms of operation and funding -- of moving 20,000 Kosovo refugees
to the US next month.  Lavinia Limon, ORR, outlined the following two
options, and suggested that the likely outcome will be a mixture of both.
There will be a conference call tomorrow (NSC, HHS, OMB) to further
discuss Scenarios 1 and 2.

Scenario1: Process refugees abroad

Refugee processing (INS interviews, medical screening, etc) is conducted
overseas and State Dept picks up the costs.

HHS estimates that of the 20,000 arriving refugees:
  -- 35% would be eligible for Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) and Refugee
Medical Assistance (RMA) , increasing program costs by $23.3 million in
FY99, and $14.6 million in FYOO;
-- 10% would be eligible for SSI/MA (no cost estimate available at this
time) ;
-- 55% would be eligible for TANF/MA (no cost estimate available at this
time); and,
-- all would be eligible for Food Stamps (no cost estimate available at
this time).

Scenario 2: Process refugees in the US

When processing refugees in the US, the Refugee Act requires the Secy of


HHS to operate a domestic processing center. DoD is exploring the use of
military facilities as processing centers. HHS estimates that processing
could take up to 6 months. Under this scenario, HHS provided very rough
cost estimates (as follows), but plans to meet with DoD folks on Monday to
compare numbers.

-- $20 million for placement, reception (OMB will see if State Dept can
cover these     costs.)
   $10 million for ongoing transportation
-- $15 million contractor staff, communications, orientation, recreation
-- $23 million medical, dental, hospital
TOTAL processing costs = $68 million for FY 99

Since refugees would reside in camps for the remainder of FY 99, there
would be no program costs until FY 00.  HHS estimates FYOO additional RCA
and RMA costs of $38.7 million.

processing refugees in the US may require changes in the supp.  OMB is
investigating.   ACF-ORR conveyed that the ORR could cover the FY 99 costs
associated with this option.  However, the FY 00 budget would leave them
with a cushion of only $5 million.
