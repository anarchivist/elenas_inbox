TEXT:
I think that someone in DPC will have to talk to Leg. Affairs about our
briefing papers. Every time we hand one in, they ask me if Lerry, Janet,
Peter Jacoby or another Leg. Affairs Special Assistant is manifested for
our briefings. This is not my call to make, and by the time they ask me
it is normally too late.

I do not know if you all want to include them each time there are members
present or to explain to them that the briefing is to brief the President
on policy rather than which members are present. But someone higher than
myself should talk to Larry or Janet directly so I don't have to discuss
with Jessica every time.  Just an FYI- b/c Larry or Janet might raise with
one of you all first.
