Subject: Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)


This memo provides you with background on two issues concerning the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): the potential controversy surrounding the impending
publication of regulations implementing the 1997 amendments; and criticism by the National
Governors Association and others that, in light of extensive federal requirements, the federal
government does not adequately support the cost of educating students with disabilities.

General Background

In 1975, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which guaranteed a
free, appropriate public education for all students with disabilities. That law, now known as the
IDEA, has been amended several times since, most recently in 1997.

The IDEA Amendments of 1997 substantially reflected the Administration's own reauthorization
proposals, and were the result of detailed negotiation with Hill leadership. The reauthorization
retained the civil rights component of the law by still requiring States to provide all children with
disabilities a "free appropriate public education" designed to meet their individual needs. This
requirement applies without regard to the cost of the services or the size ofthe federal
appropriation. The 1997 amendments added a focus on improving educational outcomes for
children with disabilities. For instance, they required States to develop educational achievement
goals for children with disabilities, and to include children with disabilities on State and
district-wide assessments.

IDEA has always been controversial because it imposes prescriptive and costly administrative
mandates on States, and because States want the federal government to pay a larger share of
special education costs. States are not required to accept IDEA funding and its related federal
mandates, but none have seriously threatened to withdraw from participation.

IDEA Regulations

The regulatory development process has been lengthy and contentious. After publishing the
proposed rule in October 1997, the Department of Education (ED) received extensive criticism
from State lawmakers, school officials, and the majority in Congress. State lawmakers and
school officials complained that the proposed rule was complex and difficult to understand,
limited flexibility at the local level, and created overly prescriptive and costly requirements. The
majority in Congress echoed these concerns, and charged that the rules created policies
inconsistent with the carefully worked out bipartisan agreements that characterized the enactment
of the IDEA Amendments of 1997.
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

In response to these concerns, the Department reviewed the rule's content across the board to
find ways to ease requirements where possible, and to make the final rule easier to understand.
The Department's rewrite of the rule involved extensive consultations with the Hill as well as
members of the public.

Even with the significant changes and improvements to final rule (see below), it should be noted
that the IDEA statute itself is complex and prescriptive. Thus, while ED was able to achieve
some regulatory relief in the rewrite of the final rule, the law itself is the source of the vast bulk
of the administrative burden.

While the NGA did not comment on the proposed regulations, ED notes that one individual
governor did, Pete Wilson of California. His issue concerned services required for young people
aged 18-21 who are incarcerated in prisons. According to ED, former Governor Wilson's
concern could not be accommodated because it was contrary to the IDEA statute.

ED hopes to publish a final rule in early March (publication is being delayed pending final
review of the issues). Following recent negotiations and subsequent agreements with the Hill on
the issues described below, the Department now believes the final rule strikes an appropriate
balance
between all of the interested parties, including those in the disability community, school officials,
State lawmakers, and Members of Congress in both parties. However, Hill staff cannot
guarantee that all members will refrain from attacking the Administration on discipline or other
Issues

The Department's main substantive changes in response to criticism are in the provisions relating
 to: discipline of a disabled student who is violent or troublesome; in what kind of class~oom
setting to place a child during a dispute over hislher current placement ("pendency"); the services
required after a student graduates; and when to include special education students in regular
education classrooms. Each is discussed below.

Discipline: IDEA allows school personnel to suspend students with disabilities for up to 10
school days before the suspension is deemed a "change in placement." A change in placement
requires the school district to do three things: (I) reevaluate the educational services provided to
the student, as determined through the student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP); (2)
establish a "behavioral assessment plan," for the student (i.e., a set of services and strategies
designed to address and improve the student's behavior), if one does not already exist; and (3)
determine whether the student's behavior is a manifestation of their disability. These are
expensive and time-consuming requirements.

In the NPRM, ED defined "10 days" as meaning "10 cumulative days in a school year." Past
practice used a definition of "1 0 consecutive days," a definition preferred by most school
officials because it is less proscriptive. ED changed the definition because both they and the
disability community were concerned that school officials could abuse the "10 consecutive days"


                                                  2
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

 definition by repeatedly suspending a student for less than 10 days in order to circumvent the
 "change in placement" requirement. For instance, under the "10 consecutive days" definition, a
 school official could suspend a student for nine straight days, allow the student to come back for
 one day, and then suspend him/her for nine more days, without causing a "change in placement."

 The NPRM's "10 cumulative day" approach would have triggered the expensive IEP changes
 and manifestation determinations more frequently, and both school officials and Republican
 members of Congress strongly objected to the change. As a compromise between them and the
 disability community, in the final rule the Department proposes to only require schools to
 establish a "behavioral assessment plan" following the 10th cumulative day, with the intent that
 these behavior modification services will keep the student from repeating hislher class disruptive
 behavior. At the same time, ED retained the full "change in placement" review requirements for
 a suspension lasting 10-consecutive days, which is not controversial.

. Discipline may be the lead topic of renewed criticism under the proposed final rule; many in
  Congress and many school systems will believe that the schools are given too little flexibility in
  addressing disruptive children with disabilities.

Pendency: The IDEA statute sets up a hearing process to arbitrate between a parent and a school
when there is a disagreement over a child's placement (e.g., whether a child should be moved
from a special education class to a regular education setting). During such a disagreement, the
statute requires the child to remain in hislher current placement unless the school and parent
agree otherwise.

The contentious issue in the NPRM regarded the placement ofthe child following the first
hearing officer's review and the pending appeal. The NPRM stipulated that if the hearing
officer sided with the placement, then the child would be placed where the parents want himlher
placed; if the hearing office sided with the school, the child would remain in hislher current
placement pending further review. In the public comment, objections were raised that this
procedure did not treat parents and schools equally. However, ED set the NPRM up this way
deliberately [in order to give the parent the benefit of the doubt, and to encourage their
involvement in their child's education.]

As a compromise, in the proposed final rule the Department would mandate the above process
only when the child's case was being heard by a State hearing officer (a less frequent
occurrence). In all other cases, the child would be placed according to the decision of the first
hearing officer pending appeal.

High School Graduation: In the NPRM, ED required that graduating students be reevaluated to
determine whether additional services should be provided, and provided non-binding guidance
that a student would have to graduate with a regular diploma (i.e., not a certificate of attendance)
in order for eligibility of services to terminate. ED included these requirements because it was



                                                  3
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

concerned that some school districts were "graduating" students from high school with a less
than regular high school diploma in order to stop providing services to these students.

In response to complaints about the NPRM's proscriptive graduation policies, the Department
would change the final rule to state that students with disabilities do not have to be reevaluated
when they graduate with a regular high school diploma, and that they must continue to receive
services only if they graduate with less than a high school diploma until they reach the maximum
age set in State law (States have different maximum ages for when they stop providing special
education services to students, ranging from age 18 to 21).

Placement o/Special Education Students in Regular Education Classrooms: A major focus of
the IDEA statute is placing special education children, to the maximum extent possible, in a
general education environment. The rationale behind this focus is to provide special education
students with an opportunity to socialize with regular education students and have the
opportunity to strive for the same academic goals as their nondisabled peers. Some commenters
on the proposed rule felt that including special education students in regular classrooms is too
disruptive, because it requires teachers to spend an disproportionate amount of time with the
special education students"

ED's position in the final rule reflects long standing Department policy on this issue, which is:
(1) whenever appropriate, special education students should be placed with their nondisabled
peers; (2) schools can remove specials education students from general education classrooms ifit
is found that the student is not making satisfactory educational progress, even with supportive
special education services; and (3) schools are prohibited from removing special education
students from a classroom only because the child requires a modification to curriculum currently
being taught in that class.

Special Education Funding

Critics, most particularly the Governors, argue that federal funding does not live up to the IDEA
statute's commitment that the federal government will provide States with 40 percent of the
average per pupil expenditure for each disabled student. In fact, the IDEA makes no such
commitment. The statute only limits the maximum grant a State can receive in a year to this 40
percent level. The highest percentage ever reached was 12.5 percent in 1979; 1999 funding
should cover about 11.2 percent.

While federal funding for special education State Grants (the primary federal special education
program) has increased by $2.2 billion or 110 percent during this Administration, from $2.1
billion in FY 1993 to $4.3 billion in FY 1999, these increases were not requested by this
Administration. Congressional Republicans in recent years have seized on IDEA as a defining
issue on education, demonstrating their concern for the "mandate" and for the burden placed on
States, by providing large annual increases. We believe this pattern will be repeated for FY
2000.

                                                                                      Hex-Dump ConversIOn

Whatever amount we might propose for IDEA, the Republicans will always be able to offer
more, because they will not, at least initially, fund our other education and training priorities at
the levels we seek, such as Title I or the Workforce Investment Act. Instead, we argue that we
are in fact substantially aiding children with disabilities with many of our other high priority
investments. These children benefit from the smaller classes in our Class Size Reduction
initiative, from modem school facilities in our School Modernization Bonds proposal, and from
our early intervention initiatives such as America Reads and Head Start.
In the FY 2000 budget we propose a targeted increase for special education of $116 million for
early intervention programs and to help States take advantage of research on effective practices,
but virtually no increase for the major state grant. The total budget request for all parts of IDEA
is $5.4 billion, of which $4.3 billion is for the state grant.
It should also be noted that the IDEA Amendments of 1997 imposed a "trigger" engaged when
federal funding reached $4.1 billion, allowing an LEA to divert up to 20 percent of their
maintenance of effort funding away from special education if the allocation exceeded that of the
prior year. Therefore, federal IDEA increases do not increase spending on children with
disabilities dollar for dollar.
