TEXT:
Senator Monyihan's office has called the Department of Interior asking
what the Administration's position is with respect to the Gorton
amendment, which requires Indian tribes to collect state taxes on the sale
of tobacco products to non Indians.    There doesn't seem to be any debate
over our position-- the Department of Justice recently testified in March
of this year that we don't favor this type of legislation because it
interferes with tribal sovereignty.  Let me know if it is alright if
Interior calls Monyihan's office back.
