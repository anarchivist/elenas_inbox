TEXT:
 The President on Wednesday will be talking to the Trotter Group, an
organization of African American columnists.

For the briefing memo, I'm looking for basic q's and a's on affirmative
action, welfare reform, and federal sentencing guidelines on cocaine.

Christa suggested I make the request through you. (If any other race
related issues come to mind, please add them to the list. The writers are
supposed to stick to the speech and initiatives, but may raise other
topics. )

Thanks.
