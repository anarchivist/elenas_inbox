MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:       Executive Order on Race Profiling


As you know, next Wednesday you are scheduled to participate in an hour-long, round table
discussion with about 30 representatives from the civil rights and law enforcement community,
including:                                                      . This discussion is meant to help
the civil rights and law enforcement communities find common ground and constructive ways to
deal with the controversial issue of police abuse and misconduct. Although we and the Attorney
General have already met separately with many of the individuals invited to participate in the
round table, many of them remain skeptical about each other's motives -- as well as of the
meeting's potential outcomes. We are hopeful that your involvement in the round table will
help keep all interested parties at the table and working together.

In preparation for this important meeting, we also drafted an Executive Order that would decry
law enforcement's use of racial profiling and direct federal law enforcement agencies to begin
collecting and reporting data on the number and percentage of persons they stop, search, or
otherwise examine by race, ethnicity, color, or gender. Within one year of the system's
implementation, the Attorney General would be required to report on the findings of the data
collection systems and make any appropriate recommendations on how to ensure fairness in
federal law enforcement's stops and searches.

All of your White House advisors generally agree that the proposed Executive Order is the best
and quickest way for you to take action and show federal leadership on the issue of racial
profiling. The only exception is Chris Edley, who believes data collection is too weak, and
instead supports an immediate and total ban on federal law enforcement's use of racial profiling.
Although we do not disagree with Chris in principle -- and neither do nearly all of the federal law
enforcement agencies who insist that they do not engage in racial profiling and could support
such a ban -- there is a significant problem with his approach: the fact that the U.S. Border Patrol
relies on a person's perceived ethnicity or national origin in enforcing our immigration laws.
Thus, a sweeping federal ban on racial profiling would require you to either:

       (1) exempt the Border Patrol, now the largest federal law enforcement agency (with about
       8,000 officers) and one of only a few that regularly conducts traffic stops; or

       (2) stop the Border Patrol from relying on a person's perceived ethnicity or national
       origin as a reason for making a traffic stop when -- in fact -- the person's ethnicity or
       national origin may be what causes a violation oflaw.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
 We do not believe that either of these options are workable in the short-term. Hispanic
 advocacy groups will strongly oppose any federal ban on racial profiling that exempts the Border
 Patrol. And without additional data and a better understanding of the problem, the Justice and
 Treasury Departments (because of the similarities between the enforcement functions of the
 Border Patrol and the U.S. Customs Service) will oppose a federal ban on racial profiling that
 undermines their enforcement of immigration and contraband laws at our borders and points of
 entry. Accordingly, we all support the Executive Order on data collection as a first step.

  However, your White House advisors disagree on the appropriateness of signing this Executive
  Order at the Wednesday meeting, and request your guidance on this matter. Most of us (DPC,
  Chief of Staff, Communications, and the Justice Department) believe that it is critical for you to
  take some action at the Wednesday meeting, so that the media does not view the round table as
  just one more meeting to talk about race and do nothing. Additionally, we believe that the
  proposed Executive Order -- though by no means a panacea -- mirrors and complements the
  Conyers legislation calling for state and local data on traffic stops, and that it will ultimately be
  well received by a majority ofthe civil rights community and American public. It is important
, to note that many of the major law enforcement organizations opposed increased data collection,
  and we should not expect them to be supportive of the Executive Order.

 Others in the White House (though primarily Chuck Ruff) believe that by signing the Executive
 Order at the rouIid table discussion you will undermine the very relationship we will be trying to
 foster with key members of the civil rights ·and law enforcement communities. Both
 communities will feel that they were not consulted about the Executive Order, and they will
 oppose or criticize -- albeit for differing reasons -- your action as going too far or not far enough.
  As a result of this concern, Chuck supports not signing the Executive Order until several weeks
 later.

         _ _ Sign the Executive Order to collect data on federal law enforcement stops.


         _ _ Do not sign the Executive Order to collect data on federal law enforcement stops.


                Let's discuss.
