      TEXT:


    As you may have heard, Reps Hansen and Meehan plan to introduce their menu
    bill tomorrow.  Their draft is currently being tweeked at leg counsel
    we should get it tonight (I have the older version if anyone wants it
    all of 3 1/2 pages). Here's what the bill does:

    Permits the Secretary to waive recoupment if the State has filed with the
    Secretary a plan which outlines how it will spend at least 25 percent of
    each year's tobacco settlement efforts to:

           Reduce tobacco use (including cessation, enforcement activities,
    community-based and school-based programs),

            Fund tobacco research and surveillance

            Fund statewide counteradvertising and

           Assist in the economic development of farmers and their
    communities as they transition to a more broadly diversified economy

    There's language requiri~g this spending to supplement, not supplant,
    current spending and for all efforts to take into account the needs of
    minority populations and high risk groups.
