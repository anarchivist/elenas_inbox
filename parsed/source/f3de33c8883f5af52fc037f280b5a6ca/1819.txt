           DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S YOUNGEST CHILDREN


 "Learning begins in the first days oflife. Scientists are now discovering how young
 children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for
 parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants .... We already know we
 should start teaching children before they start school. "

                 -- President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4, 1997




Recent scientific research has demonstrated that experiences during the earliest years of life --
before children reach school age -- are critical to their cognitive, emotional, and physical
development. Nurturing and stimulating children in the first years of life actually help their
brains develop and prepare them for the challenges of school and later life. President Clinton is
committed to giving America's children the opportuni!y to live up to their God-given potential by
investing in research, supporting parents and caregivers, and strengthening programs that provide
early intervention to disadvantaged families.

Supported Over 90% of all Children's Research. In fiscal year 1995, the federal government
spent an estimated $2 billion on research and development directly related to children and youth
-- over 90% of all funding of children's research. Spending on children's health research at
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) increased 25% between 1993 and 1997, and this year
NIH will spend $904 million on research on young children alone. This research has
contributed to the recent advances in understanding early learning and language development.

Increased participation in Head Start, created Early Head Startfor 0-3 year oids, and
improved program quality. For more than thirty years, Head Start has been one of our nation's
best investments. By ensuring that low-income children start school ready to learn, Head Start
can pay for itself. For that reason, President Clinton has made expanding and improving Head
Start a priority of his Administration. Over the past four years, funding for the program has
increased by 43%, and in fiscal year 1997 Head Start will serve 800,000 low-income children
four years old and younger. Initiated in 1994, there are now 142 Early Head Start programs
across the country, expanding the proven benefits of Head Start to low-income families with
children under three. Over the last three years, the Clinton Administration has also invested
significantly in improving program quality, providing local programs with the resources they
need to attract and retain high quality teachers and ensuring the safety of Head Start centers. The
President's 1998 budget proposal provides a $324 million increase in Head Start's budget so that
it will remain on course to serve 1 million children by 2002.



                                                                        Automated Records Management Systell'
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
nutrition packages, nutrition education, and health referrals to low-income pregnant women,
infants, and children. Over the past four years participation has expanded by 1.7 million from 5.7
to 7.4 million women, infants, and children. The increase in the President's budget proposal
fulfills his commitment to achieving full participation in WIC by the end of 1998. Research
shows that WIC prenatal services save Medicaid much more than they cost by reducing health
care expenses in the first 60 days after birth.

Raised Childhood Immunization Rates to an All-Time High. The President's Childhood
Immunization Initiative focuses on five areas: 1)improving the quality and quantity of
vaccination delivery services; 2) reducing vaccine costs for parents; 3)increasing community
participation, education and partnerships; 4)improving systems to monitor diseases and
vaccinations; and 5) improving vaccines and vaccine use. This initiative has achieved notable
success: in 1995, seventy-five percent of two-year olds were fully immunized -- an historic high.
Funding for childhood immunization has doubled since fiscal year 1993.

Improved Support/or Infants and Toddlers with Special Needs. Under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Infants and Families Program supports the continuing
efforts of States to implement high quality statewide early intervention services for infants and
toddlers with disabilities. Over the past four years, funding for the program has increased by 48%
or $102.5 million. During the same period, the number of children served increased by 21.5
percent. An estimated 191,000 children will be served in fiscal year 1998.

Enhanced Family Literacy Program. Even Start Family Literacy is a family-focused grant
program to improve the educational opportunities for children and their parents in low-income
areas by integrating family literacy activities, including early childhood education, adult
education, and parenting education. Since 1993, funding for Even Start has increased by over
40% to support programs in every state and the District of Columbia.

Providing Funding for Parent Resource Centers in 42 States. In addition to involving parents in the
development of state and local education plans, the President's Goals 2000 program provides
funding to establish parent resource centers that help parents learn how to help their children
meet high standards. The centers provide training, distribute resource materials, and support a
variety of programs that strengthen family involvement in education. In fiscal year 1997,
funding is available for support centers in 42 states, 14 more than in 1996.

Promoting Parents as First Teachers. The President's America Reads Challenge, a campaign
to ensure that every child can read well by the end of the third grade, includes Parents as First
Teach~rs Challenge Grants to fund proven local, regional and national programs that provide
assistance to parents to heIp their children become successful readers. The grants can be used to
expand successful programs such as the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters
(HIPPY) and the Parents as First Teachers (P ~ T) program. They will also fund national and
regional networks to share information on how parents can help children to read.

Passed Family and Medical Leave. The President fought for the passage of the Family and

                                                                    Automated Records Management Sysler

newborn or adopted child, to attend to their own serious health needs, or to care for a seriously ill
parent, child or spouse. In June 1996, President Clinton proposed to expand FMLA to allow
workers to take up to 24 unpaid hours off each year for school and early childhood education
activities, routine family medical care, and additional activities related to caring for an elderly
relative. Last week, the President asked Federal agencies to implement his expanded leave.
policy immediately for Federal workers.

Protected the Medicaid Guarantee/or 10 Million Children Under 6 Years Old. This
Administration has protected and, preserved -- and now will improve on -- the guarantee of
Medicaid coverage for 36 million Americans, including 9 million children under the age of 6. In
1995, the President vetoed the Republican Medicaid block grant proposal that would have ended
the guarantee of coverage for up to 4 million children by 2002. At the same time, the President
worked with states by granting 15 comprehensive Medicaid waivers and approving many more
state plan amendments that improve and expand coverage for children.

Seeks to Extend Health Coverage to Up to 5 Million Children. Although this Administration
has made great strides in protecting the health of America's neediest children, there is still much
to be done. In 1995, more than 10 million American children, 80% of whom have working
parents, had no health insurance. The President's budget takes three important steps to address
the problem of children who lack health insurance coverage:
1)      Provides annual grants to states to cover health insurance premiums for families of
        workers who are in-between jobs;
2)      Utilizes state partnership grants to help working families who are not eligible for
        Medicaid to purchase private insurance for their children; and
3)      Expands Medicaid coverage by allowing states to continue Medicaid coverage for up to
        one year even if family income changes, intensifying outreach to children who are
        currently eligible but not enrolled, and continuing current law expansions of coverage to
        reach poor children between the ages of 13 and 18.

Fighting Pediatric A1DS. In 1994, the National Institutes of Health released new research
showing that the use of the drug AZT by HIV -infected pregnant women can reduce the risk of
transmission from mother to child by two-thirds. In response, the Food and Drug
Administration quickly approved changes in labeling indications for AZT to include
HIV -infected pregnant women and, in 1995, the Centers for Disease Control began
recommending routing HIV counseling and voluntary HIV testing for all pregnant women. In
addition, the President has consistently supported investment through Title IV of the Ryan White
CARE Act, which provides grants for coordinated HIV services and access to research for
children, women and families. Since 1994 [why since 1994], $113 million has been
appropriated [percentage increase?] under Title IV, with 59 organizations in 26 states, Puerto
Rico and the District of Columbia receiving support.

Protecting Mothers and Newborns. Due to the Clinton Administration's comprehensive
strategy to increase access to prenatal care, the preliminary estimate for the U.S. infant mortality
rate (the rate at which babies die before their first birthday) is at an historic low of less than 8
deaths per 1,000 live births in 1995, and the proportion of mothers getting early prenatal care is

                                                  3                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                             '~ex-DiJmp Conversion


    at a record high of 81 percent. In addition, the President spearheaded legislation requiring
    insurance companies to cover at least 48 hour hospital stays following childbirth. In 1970, the
    average length of stay for an uncomplicated delivery was four days, but by 1992 it had declined
    to two days. This legislation ensures that mothers and babies do not leave the hospital before
    they and their doctors decide they are ready.

    Preventing Infant Suffocation. The Clinton Administration launched the Back to Sleep public
    education campaign to send the message to parents and health professionals that putting babies to
    sleep on their backs can reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Largely as a
    result of this campaign, SIDS deaths dropped by 30% between 1992 and 1995.

    Improved Child Care in Public Housing. The Early Childhood Development Program helps to
    provide quality child care for families living in public housing communities, as well as families
    who are homeless or at risk of becoming so. The program allows parents or guardians who live in
    public housing to get and keep jobs by ensuring that their children are cared for. In 1996, $21
    million was awarded to public housing sites across the country -- three times more than in 1994.

    Increased Child Care Funding. Since 1993 federal funding for child care has increased by 22%,
    providing quality services for over 660,000 children of whom 65% are under 5 years of age.
    The newly established Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) has made available $2.9
    billion to states. This new program, authorized by the new welfare law, will assist low-income
    families and those coming off welfare to obtain child care so they can work or attend school.

    Providing High Qualify Child Care for Military Families. Under the Clinton Administration,
    the Department of Defense has made important strides to improve the quality of child care for the
    children of the men and women who serve our country. Since 1992, the number of military
    child care facilities that are accredited by the independent National Association for the Education
    of Young Children has risen from 55 to 466. Currently, 72% of military child care programs are
    accredited, as compared to only 7% of other child care facilities nationwide.

    Controlling Childhood Lead Poisoning. The Administration has launched a major new effort
    to control childhood lead poisoning. The program requires landlords and sellers of older homes
    to notify prospective tenants and buyers about lead-based paint hazards, provides grants to states
    to control lead-based paint hazards in low-income privately-owned homes, and offers technical
    assistance to ensure that lead hazard control work is done safely and efficiently. The 1997
    interim report evaluating the HUD Lead-Based Point Hazard Control grant program shows that
    median dust levels on interior window sills were reduced by 85 percent. In addition, the number
    of children suffering from lead poisoning dropped from 1.7 million in the late 1980s to about
    930,000 in the mid-1990s.

    Protecting Our Children's Environment. Because their bodies are still developing, children are
    among the most vulnerable to pollution in the air, water. and soil. In 1995, the Clinton
    Administration began requiring that children receive first consideration when EPA assesses
    environmental hazards and sets public health standards. In addition, the Clinton Administration
    has strengthened environmental protections for children by: proposing to strengthen air quality
    standards for soot and smog to protect an additional 13 million children from air pollution,

                                                                           l..{ex-DiJmp Conversion
sites to protect the 10 million children under age 12 who live within four miles of a toxic waste
dump; strengthening drinking water protections to ensure that drinking water is free of microbial
contaminants; expanding families' right to know about environmental health risks that infants
and children face to help them make informed decisions about their children's exposure to these
risks; issuing advisories about contaminated fish so parents can protect children from
cancer-causing PCBs; and educating parents about the effects of second-hand smoke, which
annually results in 7,500 to 15,000 hospitalizations of infants and children under 18 months of
age.

Improved Children's Television. The President announced a breakthrough agreement with the
media and entertainment industry to develop a television ratings system to enable parents to
protect their children from violence and adult content. In addition, the Administration has given
parents greater control over what their children watch on television by requiring the installation
of anti-violence screening chips ("V -chips") in all new televisions.
