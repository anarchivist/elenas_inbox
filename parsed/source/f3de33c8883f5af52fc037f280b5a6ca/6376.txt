TEXT:
FYI -- In case it comes up in any other Native American meetings you may
have, we are still working on trying to come up with an executive order on
Native American education.   (This was the executive order that was
proposed by many of the Native American groups, and that the groups are
really pushing for. )

        We have asked the agencies for more substantive input because the
current draft of the executive order doesn't really accomplish much.  The
agencies have asked for a little more time to come up with some ideas, but
we hope to meet again on this later in the week. Thanks, Mary
