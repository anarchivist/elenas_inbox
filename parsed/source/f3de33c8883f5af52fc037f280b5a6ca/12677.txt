The Honorable C.W. Bill Young
Chairman
Committee on Appropriations
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       The purpose of this letter is to provide the Administration's views on the Treasury, Postal
Service, and General Government Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as reported by the House
Subcommittee. As the Committee develops its version of the bill, your consideration of the
Administration's views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates the Subcommittee's efforts to accommodate many of the
President's priorities within the 302(b) allocation. Within the 302(b) allocation, the
Subcommittee has made difficult choices to produce a balanced bill. The President's FY 2000
Budget proposes levels of discretionary spending that meet important national needs while
conforming to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings proposals in mandatory and
other programs available to help finance this spending. The Administration urges the Congress
to consider such proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves forward. In particular,
with respect to this bill, the Administration urges the Committee to consider our proposals for
Customs user fees.

      The following discussion highlights our specific concerns with the Subcommittee bill.
We look forward to working with you to resolve these issues as the bill moves forward.

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

        The Administration is concerned that the House Subcommittee has not included the
requested $15 million for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm's (ATF's) headquarters
site acquisition. The current location of ATF's headquarters does not meet the minimum
security guidelines as described in the Department of Justice's 1995 Vulnerability Assessment
and is less secure than many Federal buildings that do not house a law enforcement agency. To
ensure adequate security for ATF employees, we urge the Committee to fund the President's
request for ATF's site acquisition.

Federal Employees Health Benefits Program

       The Administration strongly opposes sections 509 and 510 ofthe bill. These provisions
                                                                    tlex.·Oump Conversion


would restrict Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) coverage for abortions
except in situations where the life of the mother is endangered or the pregnancy is the result of
rape or incest. While the President believes that abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, the
Administration does not believe that Federal employees and their families should be precluded
from choosing to purchase health insurance that includes broader coverage. The Administration
believes that the decision to cover abortion should be left to each health plan participating in the
FEHBP. Federal employees who wished to purchase health coverage that does not include
abortion services would have that choice. The provision in the Subcommittee bill does not
allow Federal employees and their families to make that choice.

        The Administration supports the provision of the Subcommittee bill (section 635) that
continues current law requiring coverage of prescription contraceptives by health plans
participating in the FEHBP and would oppose an amendment to strike it. We support
improvements in the basic health care coverage for women and the goal of the provision: to
reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for abortion.

        The Administration opposes inclusion of section 514 in the bill, which would extend the
one-year moratorium enacted in last year's bill on the application of Cost Accounting Standards
(CAS) to experience rated contracts awarded under the FEHBP. The provision is unnecessary in
light of the waiver on application of CAS to the FEHBP awarded last year by the Cost
Accounting Standards Board under its existing authority. The affected parties have been
working to address the range of issues presented. Any new statutory waiver would cut short this
work prematurely, before long-term solutions are achieved, costing the Federal Government
millions of dollars annually, based on CBO estimates.

WHLA and OMB LA suggest the following bracketed language not be included (amendments on
this issue are note expected):

[Pay Raise for Federal Judges and the Executive Schedule

        The Administration applauds the Subcommittee for not including language denying
a pay raise in 2000 to the Executive Schedule and Federal judges. Denying an annual pay
raise to these senior Government officials in every year but one since 1993 has severely
eroded their purchasing power and created pay compression throughout the senior ranks
of Government. This cannot continue if the Government is to attract and retain the
dedicated and talented people it needs for these positions. This is especially true for
Federal judges, who make a lifetime commitment to public service and who, therefore, in
return should reasonably expect that their compensation will not erode significantly both
in real terms and in relation to other workers in the public and private sectors.)




                                                 2
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
Salary of the President

        The Administration commends the action of the Subcommittee to raise the President's
salary, effective with the beginning ofthe next Presidential term on January 20, 2001. The
President's salary has not been increased for 30 years and, as a result, has declined significantly
relative to inflation and wage growth in the economy. An increase would restore an appropriate
relationship between the President's salary and the salaries of other senior Government officials
and, in addition, would bring the salary of the President more in line with the duties and
responsibilities of the Office.

Federal Buildings Fund

        The Administration is concerned that the Subcommittee has not provided the requested
$94 million for new construction projects in the Federal Buildings Fund, including the design
and construction of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) headquarters (phase I), the
design and/or construction of five border stations, and the demolition of the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations. Postponement of these projects would result in inefficient space utilization by
housing the FDA in 48 buildings at 20 locations and the U.S. Mission in a building that is too
small to meet its needs. This would also adversely affect public safety at these five border
stations because the transportation infrastructure is inadequate to accommodate increased traffic
volumes. We would encourage and support efforts to include funding for these projects.




                                                3

      Additional Administration concerns are contained in the enclosure. We look forward to
working with the Committee to address our mutual concerns.

                                          Sincerely,

                  The Honorable David R. Obey, The Honorable Jim Kolbe,
                             and The Honorable Steny H. Hoyer

                       ADDITIONAL CONCERNS
    DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY, THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE
 PRESIDENT, THE POSTAL SERVICE, AND CERTAIN INDEPENDENT AGENCIES
                        APPROPRIATIONS BILL
            (AS MARKED UP BY THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE)


General Services Administration

       Policy and Operations. The Administration is c;oncerned that the Subcommittee bill does
       not include $10 million for "Accessibility for People with Disabilities," which
       implements section 508 of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act (P.L. 105-220)
       passed by Congress on August 7, 1998. This reduction would eliminate $8 million to
       fund a coordinated, inter-agency effort and $2 million for an underwriters laboratory to
       ensure interoperability and standardization of information technology hardware and
       software for use by people with disabilities. This initiative would promote and support
       employment by people with disabilities as envisioned by the Americans with Disabilities
       Act and ensure that participation by Americans with disabilities will become integral to
       the digital transformation of American society.

National Archives and Records Administration

       Records Declassification. The Administration objects to the proposed $5 million
       reduction to the request for the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)
       to accelerate the declassification of Federal records. Pursuant to Executive Order
       12958, "Classified National Security Information," agencies must review all records 25
       years old or older for declassification by April 17,2000. As the agency responsible for
       oversight of the Government's entire classification and declassification program and one
       of the four agencies most heavily involved in records declassification (others include
       CIA, Defense, and Energy), NARA would use the additional funding to support 50
       additional declassification experts as well as to strengthen the Information Security
       Oversight Office to help it meet this deadline.




Office of National Drug Control Policy
                                                                      Automated Records MlllIAgement System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion


            Funding Priorities. The Administration is concerned about the Subcommittee's funding
            of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP). While aggregate funding
            exceeds the Administration's request, there are several components that are under-funded.
             For example, the Subcommittee has cut funding by $250,000 to reduce the Office of
            Legislative Affairs by four FTE. ONDCP's Office of Legislative Affairs provides critical
            support to the ONDCP Director in working with the Congress in a bipartisan fashion on
            all drug control issues. This reduction would cripple ONDCP's ability to continue its
            efforts in this regard. Furthermore, the Subcommittee has decreased funding for policy
            research; has cutback the necessary funding for maintaining clearinghouse services; and,
            has eliminated funding for performance measures data collection. The Administration
            requests that these cuts be restored from within the total funding provided to ONDCP by
            the Subcommittee.

     Morris K. Udall Scholarship Fund

            General Funding. The Administration urges the Committee to restore funding for the
            Morris K. Udall Scholarship Fund to the requested level. The Scholarship Fund took a
            one-time reduction last year in order to finance start-up operations for the Udall
            Foundation's new Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution. This reduction
            should be restored in order to continue capitalization of the Scholarship Fund and
            increase the number of scholarships awarded to promote studies in the natural
            environment and in Native American health and tribal policy.
