TEXT:
Attached is the draft class size language Tanya and I said we would do in
this evening's mtg.
If you make edits/changes, we think we can print one of these out for each
state, with that state's budget figure and # of teachers hired under our
FY2000 budget request.  I am at a breakfast mtg from 8-9am and will be
back about 9:15am.  Tanya will be here about 9.

                     A NATIONAL EFFORT TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE:
                  SMALLER CLASSES WITH WELL-PREPARED TEACHERS
                                         February 23, 1999


AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIPARTISAN PROGRESS IN EDUCATION Last year, President
Clinton proposed a historic initiative to reduce class size in the early grades when children learn
to read and get a solid foundation in the basics by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers over
seven years. Congress enacted a down payment on this request last year with bipartisan
support, providing a one-time $1.2 billion appropriation to help communities hire approximately
30,000 teachers nationwide. This week, Congress has the opportunity to build on its bipartisan
efforts to reduce class size and finish the job by passing legislation authorizing this initiative for
the next six years.

SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE LOCAL PLANNING Under the initiative enacted into law last
year, school districts will begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin
reducing class sizes this fall. While last year's one-year appropriation provided an important
start on President Clinton's seven-year initiative, Congress has the chance to support effective
local planning by giving school districts the confidence they need that funding will be available
under this initiative for years to come. Rejecting this legislation this week will send a dangerous
message to school districts about the prospects for continued funding just at the moment when
they are beginning to make decisions about how to implement this new initiative.

INCREASED FUNDING FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION In this year's budget,
President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed $1.4 billion to hire a total 38,000 teachers.

·              This initiative would provide [STATE] with [STATE ALLOCATION] to
               support [NUMBER OF TEACHERS] to reduce class size in early grades across
               the state.


SMALL CLASSES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers
provide more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result
students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. Research shows that
smaller class size increases student achievement, reduces discipline problems and increases
instruction time for teachers,and make the greatest difference for students in the early grades and
for minority and disadvantaged students. According to studies, students from smaller classes in
North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana, Tennessee, and from across the nation outperformed their
peers in larger classes.   A national study of 10,000 4th graders and 10,000 8th graders found
the greatest impact of smaller classes on inner-city youth.

ENDORSEMENTS FROM MAJOR EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS. Most major education
organizations have expressed support for the President's initiative to reduce class size.
