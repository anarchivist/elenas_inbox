TEXT:
Kennedy and Jeffords were on the floor talking about the literacy bill a
few minutes ago.   I think they already finished the debate (it apparantly
lasted about 10 minutes), and will vote later, though I am trying to get
clarification from Kennedy's staff. I'll get to you as soon as I
know--though it certainly looks like we dodged the Hutchinson single sex
schools amendment.
