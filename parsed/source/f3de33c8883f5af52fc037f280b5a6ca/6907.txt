Record on School Safety

Q:    Mr. President, what has the Administration done to date to promote school safety
      and help reduce violence in and near our schools? Are you confident that your
      Administration has paid enough attention to this issue?

A:    Absolutely. While we currently have comprehensive juvenile crime and youth violence
      legislation before the Congress, school safety has been a priority since the start of my
      Administration. Some of the important steps we have taken include:

      Improving Safe and Drug Free Schools -- In 1994, we expanded the Drug-Free Schools
      Program to include security and violence prevention as key parts of the program. Now, the
      new Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program provides support for violence and drug prevention
      programs to 97 of the nation's school districts, and helps keep violence, drugs and alcohol
      away from students and out of schools.

      Enforcing Zero Tolerance for Guns and Other Weapons in Schools -- I signed into law the
      Gun-Free Schools Act and issued a directive requiring all schools that receive federal funds to
      enforce "zero tolerance" for guns. If a student brings a gun to school, that student will be
      expelled for a year. Now, every state in the nation has now passed a tough "zero tolerance"
      policies, and an estimated 6,000 students have been expelled for bringing weapons to schools
      -- mostly for guns.

      Encouraging Schools and Localities to Promote Discipline -- Studies show that schools with
      serious discipline problems are more likely to have serious crime problems. That is why my
      Administration has encouraged innovative policies that promote discipline and respect in our
      schools. We have distributed guidelines and studies on successful efforts by communities to
      require school uniforms, enforce curfews, and crack down on truancy. Combined with
      efforts to work with local law enforcement, involve parents and keep schools opens later and
      on weekends, these policies can help promote respect and maintain order in our schools.

      Keeping Handguns Out of the Hands of Our Children -- As part of the 1994 Crime Act, I signed
      into law the Youth Handgun Safety Act that makes it a federal offense to transfer a handgun to
      a juvenile, or for a juvenile under the age of 18 to possess a handgun or handgun ammunition
      in most circumstances. And to make sure adults complied, this year we required all federal
      gun dealers to post signs and issue written notices about the provisions of this law.

      Providing Child Safety Locks for Handguns.   We have also worked to make sure that child
      safety locks are provided with all handguns. I made sure that they were provided to all of
      our federal law enforcement officers, and I was pleased that eight of the nation's largest gun
      manufacturers followed our lead and agreed to provide child safety locks as well.
                                                                     Hex-DiJmp Conversion

Tuvenile Crime and Youth Violence

Q:     Mr. President what more does the Administration plan to do to prevent juvenile crime and youth
       violence? Do you intend to introduce new legislation to provide tougher penalties for
       violent youth, to treat more juveniles as adults, or perhaps to further restrict youth
       access to guns?

A:     Last year,. I forwarded a comprehensive anti-gang and juvenile crime strategy to the
       Congress, and it addresses many of these issues. It would, for instance: treats gangs like
       organized crime by expanding the use of racketeering statutes for gang-related offenses;
       add to the list of crimes that juveniles could be prosecuted as adults and give prosecutors
       greater flexibility to do so; and ban violent juveniles from owning guns for life. We
       should debate and consider these and other similar issues before the Congress.

       However, our first priority, must be to do everything we can to help communities save
       young lives and prevent juvenile crime and violence from happening in the first place.
       And the truth is: we already know that tough, targeted deterrence and better prevention
       will do this ..

       For example, in Boston, Federal, state and local law enforcement -- and the entire
       criminal justice system, police, prosecutors, probation officers and courts -- worked
       together to deliver a tough, targeted message on gun violence. They did this by
       identifYing the 1,300 juveniles in 60 to 70 gangs that were responsible for virtually all of
       the youth homicides in Boston; giving them the message that law enforcement wouldn't
       tolerate any shootings or stabbings; and using the full force of law on anyone who broke
       the rules. The result: the gangs were literally disarmed, and no juvenile was killed with a
       firearm for a 2 Y2 year period.

       By combining this type of tough, targeted enforcement -- with schools that are open later
       and on weekends, when most violent youth crime occurs -- we can prevent youth crime
       and violen<;e before it happens. That is why my juvenile crime bill and budget includes
       funds to replicate Boston's success in other cities. Specifically, I have called for more
       than $200 million for local prosecutors, probation officers and special court programs;
       more than $200 million to keep schools open later; and $28 million to hire more ATF
       agents and expand our gun tracing efforts that help identify illegal gun suppliers.

       Just imagine the number of young lives we could save if we expanded Boston's
       successful efforts to the handful of cities with serious juvenile crime and violence
       problems. Think of it: 85% of cities report no juvenile murders, while 5 of our largest
       cities (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit and Baltimore) account for a full 25%
       of the juvenile murders in the country (or more than 500 murders). That's why enforcing
       tough, targeted deterrence in these cities and others must be our number one priority.
