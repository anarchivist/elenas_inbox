TEXT:
I may have been cynical, but I was also right--the attached indicates I've
been bumped from the trip.

At one level, I don't really care, and can hardly argue that the President
needs me there. On the other hand, given that the leaders of the major
business groups and AFT will be at the game, my absence sends a pretty
powerful message to those folks that I'm not one of the people at the
White House they need to deal with on standards issues.
