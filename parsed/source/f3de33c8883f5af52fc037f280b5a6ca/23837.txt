Education plan Will Ensure Equality

                             By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer

                             WASHINGTON (AP)   -- The Clinton administration
will
                             propose that school districts receiving federal
funds for poor
                              students must ensure all their schools have the
same class-size
                              ratios, qualified teaching staff, course
offerings and facilities,
                             Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said
Monday.

                              In a speech delivered on the 45th anniversary of
a landmark
                              school desegregation ruling, Riley said the plan
-- among others
                              to be announced Wednesday    will narrow gaps
between the
                              rich and poor and between minority and white
students.

                             The proposals would impact the Elementary and
. secondary
                             Education Act, a 34-year-old comprehensive law
that governs
                             most federal education programs for students in
kindergarten
                              through 12th grade. Congress is expected to
renew the act later
                              this year.

                              " I t is incumbent upon us to build upon the
legacy of Brown, ' ,
                             Riley said, referring to the 1954 Supreme Court
ruling in Brown
                             vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kan. The
ruling ended
                             deliberate racial division of the nation's
schools.



                     On Monday, anniversary commemorations included
Riley's
                     speech at the Charles Sumner School Museum and
Archives in
                     Washington, and the White House launch of
, 'Winning
                     Together: Don't Erase the Progress,"   a civil
rights campaign to
                     bolster affirmative action programs on college
campuses,

                     Although schools with high poverty and minority
student
                     populations had made some strides, those schools
also offer
                     fewer classes that help prepare its students for
college, Riley
                     said,

                     "Across the country,   too many young people
particularly
                     low income and minority youth -- never make it
to the next
                     level of education,"   Riley said.

                     Nearby, at a White House conference Monday,
Americans for
                     a Fair Chance and other civil rights and student
groups pledged
                     to improve programs that encourage women and
minority
                     students to attend college.

                     The groups said they were encouraged by a recent
survey by
                     pollster Celinda Lake that found two-thirds of
the registered
                     voter respondents either support affirmative
action or could be
                     convinced it's a good idea.

                     Students on more than 300 campuses will survey
programs
                     designed to make minority students feel welcome
and advise
                     administrators on improving them, said Anthony
Samu,
                     president of the United States Students
Association,
