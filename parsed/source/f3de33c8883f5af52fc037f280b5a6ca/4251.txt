TEXT:
There's some good but mostly bad news coming out of the Congress on
welfare to work transportation:

In the House the committee bill includes an "Access to Jobs" proposal of
$42 million a year -- not the $100 million we wanted but still
significant. However, because these are authorized, not trust fund
dollars, funds would need to be appropriated on a yearly basis. In
addition, the bill explicitly sets a 10-project cap on the funds, while
the $42 million in federal funds -- plus the $42 million required match
could fund a lot more projects.  The Senate bill is not expected to have a
provision.

I've been working with NEC and DOT on these issues. DOT, despite its best
efforts, has to date been unable to persuade the committee to drop the cap
or increase the funds.  Thus, the provision passed out of subcommittee
today unchanged and is slated for full committee markup next Wednesday.
Attached is some additional information.

   STATEMENTS ON WELFARE TO WORK TRANSPORTATION


    "We must help welfare recipients get to the new jobs, which often are outside their
neighborhoods. That's why I recently proposed legislation providing $600 million to help
states and local communities devise transportation strategies to move people from welfare
                                        to work."
         President William J. Clinton, Radio Address to the Nation, July 5, 1997


 "This new initiative will insure that they can get to that job. Clearly the jobs are there.
    Now we will be augmenting existing transportation networks to help individuals
                      who leave the welfare rolls get to those jobs."
                     New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman
       announcing a new welfare to work transportation program, June 25, 1997


  "Transportation for welfare recipients making the transition to the workforce is [an]
                                          element
                 critical to the success of welfare-to-work programs."
                             National Governors' Association
        Incentives and Supports for the Employment of Welfare Recipients, 1997


"The need for transportation services is tremendous ... outpac[ing] all other concerns as the
most urgent need. The need is great for all counties -- urban, suburban, and rural. The
 reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, including new
   funds to help those who are making the transition from welfare to work, is therefore
                                       paramount."
                             National Association of Counties
                         Making Welfare Reform Work, July 1997


  "The majority [of welfare recipients] reside within the perimeter of the City of Cleveland,
   primarily in the inner city neighborhoods .... the vast majority of new jobs are expected in
suburban neighborhoods ... Public transit commutes limit job accessibility. Inner city residents
                                         can only reach
       8-15 percent of the job openings by public transportation in a reasonable time."

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

              WELFARE TO WORK TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM
               House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee bill



The inclusion of a welfare to work transportation provision in the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee ISTEA bill shows that the committee
is aware of the importance of welfare to work transportation, and of its own
responsibility to address it.

Transportation is a critical problem for people trying to make to transition to work:

      ·      Only one in twenty welfare recipients owns a car.


      ·      There is a mismatch between where the jobs are and where welfare
             recipients live: two thirds of all new jobs are in the suburbs, but
             three-quarters of welfare recipients live in rural areas on central cities.


      ·      Existing mass transit does not provide the connections to suburban
             jobs. Even in the cities with excellent mass transit, less than half of
             jobs are accessible by mass transit.


Unfortunately the funding level in the Committee bill --$42 million a year, as
opposed to the $100 million the Administration requested-- is inadequate to deal
with this major national problem.

In addition, the draft legislation explicidy sets a 1O-project cap on welfare to work
transportation projects. This does not make sense. Transportation for welfare
recipients is a problem in every state and community. By 2002 states need to have
moved half of all adult welfare recipients off of welfare and into jobs. There is not
time to deal with this issue using a go-slow "pilot" type approach.
