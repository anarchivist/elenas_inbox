Just a quickie.  Ken shared with me your note about the VP's speech to the
NGA on Monday. As I mentioned to Lee Anne, I think that going into the
detailed discussion in the memo risks bringing down on the VP's head all
those who objected to last year's version. This is narrower, but not by
much and risks being interpreted as more of the same.

I think the veep should say we are anxsious to continue to improve our
partnerships with state and local govt. (citing ed flex, medicare waivers,
performance partnerships in place) to improve the flexibility with which
they can respond to local problems. We look forward to working with them
to make improvements in this area.  More than that and we're in trouble.

Thanks.
