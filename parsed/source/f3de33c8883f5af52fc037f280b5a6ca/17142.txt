                 Commission on Immigration Reform Final R~port
                            Questions and Answers·
                              September 30, 1997


Q.     What does the Commission's fmal report say? Are there any new
             recommendations?

A.     The Commission on Immigration Reform was created in the Immigration Act of 1990 and
mandated to examine and make recommendations regarding the implementation and impact of
U.S. immigration policy. Under the leadership of its two chairs, the Honorable Shirley
Hufstedler and the late Barbara Jordan, the Commission releases its final report today.

         The final report renews many of the the Commission's earlier recommendations made in
interim reports on illegal immigration, legal immigration, and refugee policy. The Commission
reiterates its support for a comprehensive strategy to deter illegal immigration, including
increased Border Patrol and other resources at the border; better worksite enforcement; and
improvements to the deportation process. The Commission also renews its call to re-prioritize
the current system of legal immigration and reduce the overall number of legal immigrants
admitted into our country.

       The final report does contain some new recommendations: first, a proposal to restructure
the immigration system by reallocating the main functions of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) to other federal agencies; and second, a plan to better integrate immigrants into
American society.


Q.     What is the Administration's position on the Commission's proposal to eliminate the
       INS and reallocate its functions to other agencies?

A.      The Commission's proposal to reallocate the main functions of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to other agencies raises difficult and complex issues, which need further
consideration. The President has tasked the Domestic Policy Council to coordinate with the
affected federal agencies to evaluate carefully the Commission's proposal and other reform
options designed to improve the executive branch's administration of the nation's immigration
laws.

         We are proud of the progress this Administration has made toward improving America's
immigration system. The Administration has curtailed illegal immigration through tougher
border control and the removal of record numbers of criminal and other illegal aliens. We have
worked to improve and tighten the naturalization process and made needed reforms to our
asylum system for refugees fleeing persecution. And we have strengthened the disincentives to
hire illegal workers through employer verification, targeting abusive employers, and reducing
document fraud.
         The Commission notes that the Administration has taken significant steps to address
                                                            Heat-J)ump Conversion

weaknesses in INS operations that this Administration inherited. This progress results from the
committed work of many dedicated individuals at INS -- the Border Patrol, the people who
process applications, the inspectors and many others -- during a period of tremendous growth and
challenge for the agency.


Q.     Congressman Reyes intends to introduce legislation on restructuring management
       of immigration functions within the Department of Justice. Does the
       Administration prefer this approach to the Commission's?

A.       While we have not yet seen the Congressman's legislation, we will certainly review it as
part of the Domestic Policy Council-led process to look at reform options to improve the
executive branch's administration of our immigration laws.


Q.     What is the Administration's position on the Commission's renewed call to
       substantially reduce legal immigration levels?

A.       Recent changes in immigration law have made extensive reforms that could have a
significant impact on legal immigration. We will continue to monitor current reforms to
understand their full impact in order to uphold the rich immigration heritage of this nation. The
Administration supports legal immigration reform that is pro-family, pro-work, and
pro-naturalization.


Q.     Does the Administration support extending the life ofthe Commission?

A.     The final report signifies the end of the Commission's work. The Commission has made
many excellent recommendations during its tenure, and has contributed significantly to our
country's understanding of the role of immigration in the United States. We will carefully
review the Commission's newest recommendations. However, we do not see a need to further
extend the Commission.


Q.     What is the Administration's position on the Commission's call for a new
       "Americanization movement" to help legal immigrants become Americans?

A.      While we certainly need more time to review the Commission's proposal in this area, we
think that some of the ideas hold promise. The President has said many times that diversity is
one of our greatest strengths. To benefit from our diversity, we should do more to help
immigrant families' ability to participate in our national community. This may be something for
the President's Initiative on Race to include as part of the national dialogue during its work this
year.

    . Q.    Does the Administration support the Commission's proposed changes to last year's
            welfare reform law which restricts benefits for legal immigrants?

     A.      The President worked with Congress to fulfill his pledge to restore certain benefits to
     legal immigrants. The President fought to ensure that any balanced budget agreement would
     protect legal immigrants unfairly affected by legislation. The balanced budget agreement includes
     $12 billion to restore both disability and health benefits to legal immigrants who are currently
     receiving assistance and also protects current residents who may become disabled in the future.
     The Administration's efforts help ensure that our laws do not have an unduly harsh effect on
     individuals who have made vital contributions to their communities and who have put down
     roots in our nation.


     Q.     Does the Administration support the Commission's proposed improvements to the
            naturalization process? Does the INS intend to raise the fee for naturalization?

     A.      We will review carefully the Commission's recommendations in this area. The
     Administration is committed to the highest standards of integrity in the naturalization process as
     we work to improve waiting times and provide more efficient service to citizenship applicants.
     By July 31, INS had received over 1.4 million naturalization applications for the current fiscal
     year-- a 51 % increase over the same period in FY 1996. The new INS Office of Naturalization
     Operations was created four and a half months ago to strengthen the integrity of the
     naturalization system and improve customer service. The new office has made considerable
     progress on its plan to fully automate and standardize naturalization procedures across the
     country by the summer of 1998.

            With regard to a naturalization fee increase, INS has pledged that that it will not move
     forward with a fee increase until significant improvement in service has been achieved.
