TEXT:
Tanya and I just looked at this, and Option 1 (if there's not yet a
manager's amendment) seems a little soft. An alternative Option 1 would
be:

"The Administration has long supported the concept of expanding ed-flex
demonstration authority to permit all States to waive certain statutory
and regulatory requirements of Federal education, and will support S. 280
as long as accountability provisions of the bill are strengthened to
ensure that children's educational achievement is enhanced by State
waivers of Federal requirements."

        STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY

        S. 280 - EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1999

        (Sponsors: Frist (R), Tenn. and 33 others)


     The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 280, which would
expand
the "Ed-Flex" demonstration authority to permit all States to waive certain
statutory and regulatory requirements of Federal education

     [OPTION #1] programs, but urges that the accountability provisions of
the
bill be strengthened, to ensure that children's educational achievement is
enhanced by State waivers of Federal requirements.

      [OPTION #2] programs. The Administration is pleased that the pending
manager's substitute will strengthen the accountability provisions of the
bill,
which will ensure that children's educational achievement is enhanced by
State
waivers of Federal requirements.

     S .. 280 is [generally] consistent with the President's call for
expansion of
Ed-Flex in a manner that will promote high standards and accountability for
results, coupled with increased flexibility for States and local school
districts to achieve those results.

      The Administration supports a pending amendment to S. 280 that would
implement the President's proposal for a long-term extension of the I-year
authority to help school districts reduce class size in the early grades,
which
the Congress approved last year on a bipartisan basis.   In order to hire
qualified teachers, arrange for additional classrooms, and take other
steps that
are necessary to reduce class size, school districts need to know, as soon
as
possible, that the Congress intends to support this initiative for more
than one
year.
