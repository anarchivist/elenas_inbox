 Bruce, I am sorry I was out of town at the EZ Conference yesterday in
 Detroit.

 Rich and Emily briefed me about Rich's meeting with Ron and Deborah and
 our
 commitment to provide draft legislative language.

 I am glad that we are briefing DGA and Susan, Sheri, and Elaine tomorrow
 before
 we send something up to Ron.

 However, I am concerned that our governor friends will be justified in not
 seeing this as the "consultation" which we promised in the bifurcation
 guidance. Ray and others will then have both process and substance to
 argue
 against us. As you know, it is my role to worry about these relationship
 issues, and we know there will be unanticipated times in which we want
 their
 help, etc.

On a final note, I understand your desire to create some space between us
and
the states, which I think is healthy and necessary as we go through
implementation. I agree that we need to be positioned as having opposed
state
efforts to evade work requirements and as having offered a tough
legislative
proposal. ThUS, when the inevitable story comes out that some state is
using
creative accounting to avoid being serious about work, we can legitimately
claim the high ground. I just think we could go through a real
consultation
with affected parties and (since the chance of prevailing with our initial
proposal is limited) achieve the. tactical distance we need from the states


which may aggressively bifurcate.

Similarly, given the politics of individual states, we want to be in a
position
to be concerned about state practices in general we don't like (e.g.,
pulling
money out of the family support system for other purposes, lack of child
care,
refusals to implement key child support enforcement provisions). We just
want
our position to be focused on the substance, not process; and we should
stay
focused on achieving our tactical goal of distance between us and the
states,
not pushing a particular fix which may not happen on the Hill and will
only
agitate our state friends.

Sorry for this long note, John
