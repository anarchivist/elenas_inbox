DPC Colleagues:

Just a reminder that I intend to depart for Chicago tomorrow to see my
beloved Bulls win the NBA finals.   My flight leaves at noon, but I'm not
planning on corning in unless I'm needed. Also, if something comes up,
please let me know in the a.m., and I'll change my schedule if need be.
Otherwise, I'll be back Sunday afternoon (about 2pm, I think).   I'll leave
#s with singal, too.

Regards,
Jose' -- Bulls Hack One
