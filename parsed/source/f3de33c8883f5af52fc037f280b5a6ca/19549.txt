TEXT:
Thanks for calling back, Elena. You should wait for Carole to call you.
She described her piece as about how a key person with a NC voice is
moving an issue of significance to NC.   Basically, I think that means she
is. writing a tobacco story through an Erskine lens.  You might be able to
provide her with some insights (as appropriate) into how he is helping to
shape the policy at meeting of the WH team.

AS you know, Erskine is very reluctant to have press written on him.  My
goal would be to have an article that uses Erskine to help get our message
out in the key state.  I would suggest spending 5 percent on EBB and 95
percent on our message/policy. Given her past performance, Carole will
find a way to make the article reflect the exact opposite balance, but it
might have some value.

Please let me know if I can provide any more insight.   Thanks for doing
this. bb
