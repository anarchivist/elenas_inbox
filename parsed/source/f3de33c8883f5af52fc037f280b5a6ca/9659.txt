                                  Questions and Answers


Q.   What did the President announce today?

A.   The President announced approximately $70 million in grants for communities to hire
     more police and for states to improve their criminal history records:

     (1) $27.4 million in COPS hiring grants. The Justice Department's Office of Community
     Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will award $27.4 million in grants for 151 policing
     agencies across the country to hire 428 officers. This will bring the total number of
     officers funded under the President's COPS Initiative to over 88,500 -- keeping the COPS
     Initiative ahead of schedule and under budget.

     (2) $41 million to improve system of Brady background checks. The President will
     announce more than $41 million in Justice Department grants for 46 states to improve
     their criminal history records and the Brady Law's National Instant Criminal Background
     Check System. The grants, provided through the National Criminal History
     Improvement Program (NCHIP), are funded through the President's 1994 Crime Bill.
     Including today's announcement, the Administration will have awarded more than $200
     million to all 50 states.


Q.   Is there any more detail you can give us on the COPS grants? Are there any large
     departments receiving funds?

A.   Today's $27.4 million COPS grant announcement will help to fund 428 officers for 151
     law enforcement agencies in 39 states and Puerto Rico. Most of the departments
     receiving grants are located in smaller jurisdictions. Among today's larger grantees:
     $925,000 for St. Tammany Parish Sheriffs Department in Louisiana to fund 16 officers;
     $3 million for Paterson, New Jersey to fund 40 officers; and $825,000 for Oneida County
     Sheriffs Department, Wisconsin to fund 11 officers.

     States with law enforcement agencies receiving grants today are: AL, AR, CA, CO, CT,
     DE, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NE, NH,
     NJ, NM, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, WI, WV, and Puerto Rico.


Q.   Why are only 46 states receiving NCHIP grants? What happened to the other
     four?

A.   Four states -- Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, and Nevada -- either applied too late for this
      FY 98 NCHTP grant announcement or their applications required revisions. The

                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
       able to receive grants once they have met their application obligations.


Q.     What is the Top Cop award?

A.     The "Top Cop" awards are given by the National Association of Police Organizations
       (NAPO) and pay tribute to law enforcement officers from across the country for
       outstanding service to their communities during the preceding year. This year, 34
       exceptional law enforcement officers will receive the award for their heroism and
       devotion to duty and service in their communities. The President has honored NAPO
       Top Cops every year since becoming President.


Q.     Can you give us more detail on the White House Conference on School Safety that
       you are holding next week?

       On October 15, 1998, the President will host the White House Conference on School
       Safety. The Conference will be a day-long event in the East Room of the White
       House that will include participation by the President, Vice President, First Lady
       and Mrs. Gore; workshops; a morning panel discussion; and an afternoon session
       that will explore best practices and model safety strategies. The Conference will
       include communities recently affected by school shootings and will be linked by
       satellite to hundreds of communities and schools across the country.

       At the Conference, the President will issue the first Annual Report on School Safety,
       which will include: an analysis of all existing national school crime data and an
       overview of state and local school crime data; examples of schools and strategies
       that are successfully reducing school violence, drug use, and class disruption;
       actions that parents can take locally to combat school crime; and resources available
       to schools and communities to help create safe, disciplined and drug-free schools.
       In addition, the President will announce a number of new initiatives to help schools
       and communities prevent and respond to violence.


[NB: The President may sign the bills described below at the event if they pass the Congress
Thursday evening.]

Q.     Can you explain what the DeWine/Leahy legislation will do?

A.     The Crime Identification and Technology Act of 1998:

       Creates a $1.25 billion state grant program for crime technology. The bill authorizes
       $1.25 billion in grants ($250 million each year for five years) for states to upgrade their
       communications technologies and criminal justice identification systems, such as

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
           automated fingerprint and DNA identification systems, and sex offender registries. This
           grant program will help in the integration of national, state and local systems so that law
           enforcement can share information in a timely manner.

            Authorizes the Administration's National Criminal History Access and Child Protection
            Act. The bill also contains an Administration proposal -- which the President
            transmitted to Congress the day of his Child Care Conference held a year ago-- to
            authorize a federal-state compact for the interstate exchange of criminal history records
            for noncriminal purposes, such as background checks on child care and elder care
           ,workers. The Compact will help to establish a framework for the exchange of criminal
            history records which will help to increase the accuracy and completeness of criminal
            history records.


      Q.   What is does the bill introduced by Rep. Maloney do?

      A.   The bipartisan bill, introduced by Rep. James Maloney (D-CT) and Senator Ben
           Nighthorse Campbell (R-CO), will help to ensure that school safety officers can be
           funded through the Justice Department COPS Program. This summer,the President
           challenged Congress to pass the Maloney bill to help provide more school safety officers
           for our nation's schools.
