 Executive Order No. _ _ _ _ _ of June _, 1997

 Faced with the advent of a new millenium, I believe that as a nation we must reflect on the
 course we should chart toward answering the quintessentially American question: how to bring
 the Many together as One. In doing so, we must embrace and celebrate our diversity while
 establishing a new consensus of what it means to be and become One America. As important,
 we must take action to improve the ability of all Americans to realize their full potential so that
 we can, as one country equal and indivisible, move forward into the 21st Century.

 Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United
 States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.),
 and in order to establish a President's Advisory Board on Race, it is hereby ordered as follows:

         Section 1: Establishment. (a) There is established the President's Advisory Board on
 Race. The Advisory Board shall comprise 7 members to be appointed by the President.
 Members shall be chosen from the private sector and shall each have substantial experience and
 expertise in the areas to be considered by the Advisory Board. Members shall be representative
 of the diverse perspectives in the areas to be considered, by the Advisory Board.

      (b) The President shall designate a Chairperson [and a Vice-Chairperson] from among the
 members of the Advisory Board.

        Sec. 2. Functions (a) The Advisory Board shall advise the President on matters
 involving race and racial reconciliation, including ways in which the President can:

         (I) Promote a constructive national dialogue to confront and work through challenging
 issues that surround race;

         (2) Increase the nation's understanding of our recent history of race relations and the
, course our nation is charting on the issue of race relations and racial diversity;

        (3) Bridge racial divides by recruiting leaders in communities throughout the nation to
 develop and implement innovative approaches to calming racial tensions;

         (4) Find, develop and implement solutions in areas in which race has a substantial impact,
 such as education, economic opportunity, housing, health care, and the administration of justice;
 and

        (5) shall advise on such other matters which from time to time the President may request.

        (b) In carrying out its functions, the Advisory Board shall coordinate with the President's
                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        Sec. 3. Administration. (a) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the
availability of appropriations, the Department of Justice shall provide the financial and
administrative support for the Advisory Board.

       (b) The heads of executive agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide to the
Advisory Board such information as it may require for the purpose of carrying out its functions.

       [c] The Chair [or Vice-Chair] may, from time to time, invite experts to submit
information to the Advisory Board and may form subcommittees or working groups within the
Committee to review specific matters.

       (d) Members of the Advisory Board shall serve without compensation but shall he
allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for
persons serving intermittently in the Government service (5 U.S.C. 5701-5707).

        Sec. 4. General. (a) Notwithstanding any other Executive Order, the functions of the
President under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, except that of reporting to the
Congress, that are applicable to the Advisory Board shall be performed by the Attorney General,
or his or her designee, in accordance with guidelines that have been issued by the Administrator
of General Services.

       (b) The Advisory Board shall terminate on [September 30, 1998] unless extended by the
President prior to such date.
