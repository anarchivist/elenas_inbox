TEXT:
As you may know the House Commerce Cmte will be putting most of the 39K
documents (the staff is holding back 300-400 documents that may raise
trade secret concerns) on its web site tomorrow.   MN has prepared a
strategy to guide reporters through the documents over a number of days.
Tomorrow, MN will focus on documents that demonstrate an industry directed
conspiracy of 'information suppression.  These documents will show industry
attorneys involved in destroying documents, having documents altered, and
moving documents off shore. Another set of documents, to be highlighted
on a different day, will show that years ago the tobacco industry
anticipated a resolution like the one now before Congress. The documents
will show how the industry systematically restructured its companies to
move its tobacco assets to its non-tobacco companies and overseas which
has enabled the tobacco companies to plead bankruptcy will protecting much
of its assets.   Other days will focus on industry research on nicotine,
and industry efforts to manipulate public policy.
