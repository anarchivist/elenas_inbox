TEXT:
David Satcher was reported out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee
by l2-5 vote. The vote makes it very possible that we could have a
confirmed Surgeon General by the time Congress goes home for the winter.

There appears to be one major issue that might get in the way.  Prior to
the vote, Senator Coats made a big deal about Dr. Satcher supporting the
President's position on the partial birth issue.  Rich Tarplin and I are
somewhat concerned that some of the right-leaning Republicans may, once
again, take the opportunity to use the final Senate floor vote on Dr.
Satcher's confirmation as a vehicle to hit the President again on this
issue.   Worse case scenario, of course, is the politics of partial birth
has the impact of delaying the final vote until next year.

At this point, we may be being overly paranoid/cautious, but we felt -- at
the very least    we should be prepared to answer questions on this issue
one more time.  I assume it would be a reiteration of the President's
position, which of course Dr. Satcher supports, and a criticism that
certain members are -- once again -- trying to politicize "America's
doctor" and delay the valuable service he can provide.   If we hear
anything new on this front, we will advise immediately ...
