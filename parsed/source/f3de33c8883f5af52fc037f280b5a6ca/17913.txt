TEXT:
FYI, the President sent a note to Bruce and Todd Stern about an article in
last week's USA Today by Andrea Stone, which was critical of progress
since the service summit.  He wrote, "We should send our summit update to
this author -- seek to merge our race/service initiatives more."

I am following up with Ann Lewis's office to get the piece to the
reporter, but I thought you'd be interested that he made the connection.
The article refers to the race initiative by saying the President "now
devotes his bully pulpit to other concerns [than service], such as race."
