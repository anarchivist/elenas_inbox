        Q.   How will the public health infrastructure initiative outlined in today's Washington
             Post provide additional services and access to basic health care for the uninsured?

        A:   By investing $1 billion over 5 years to better coordinate and provide community-based
             health services, this initiative will help community health centers, rural health clinics,
             public hospitals, academic health centers and other providers to pool resources and better
             target and serve vulnerable populations. A number of communities across the nation
             (e.g., the Sunset Park Community Health Center, which serves over 80,000 residents of
             S.W. Brooklyn) have utilized these type of systems to more effectively utilize their
             limited resources to provide a greater range of services to the uninsured.' They are able
             to offer a much fuller array of primary and preventive care services, including
             rehabilitation, early intervention programs, health promotion, mental health and substance
             abuse services. This initiative recognizes the fact that our health care infrastructure is
             being overburdened by serving increasing numbers of uninsured at a time when indirect
             subsidies from private and public insurers are decreasing.
