      PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
      RADIO ADDRESS ON VIOLENCE AND
      THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY
      SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
      May 14, 1999

              Good morning.  In the past few weeks, our nation has been united
      in grief with the people of Littleton. Today, I want to talk to you about
      the ways we must unite in action to keep our children safe.

              Since that terrible day, people across America have searched their
      souls and searched for solutions to prevent this kind of tragedy from
      happening again. And last week, at our White House strategy session on
      children and violence, representatives of every sector of society agreed
      on one fundamental fact: making progress requires taking responsibility.

              That responsibility begins at home. Parents have a duty to guide
      children as they grow, staying engaged, staying involved in their lives,
      The most important influence on a child is a parent,

              Here in Washington, we have a responsibility to keep guns out of
      the hands of criminals and children. There is a broad national consensus
      on that point -- everywhere, it seems, except the U,S. Senate. Last week,
      the Senate twice passed a phony proposal instead of a real law that would
      close the deadly gun show loophole, through which tens of thousands of
      guns are sold each year without background checks. Even worse, the Senate
      bill is riddled with new loopholes -- permitting convicted felons to get
      guns at pawn shops, no questions asked; and making it harder, not easier,
      for law enforcement to trace guns used in crimes,

               If the Senate says it wants to fix the problem, it should fix the
      problem. At the very least it should not make the problem worse.    The
      American people deserve -- and have demanded -- better. They know that
      law-abiding citizens donD,t need loopholes in our gun laws. Only criminals
      do.   I strongly hope that in the coming weeks, the Senate will step up to
      its responsibility and do the right thing by our children.

              I have also said that the entertainment industry must do its
      part.  In 1993, shortly after I became President, I traveled to Hollywood
      and spoke to members of the community about their responsibility.   I said:
      D&You have the capacity to do· good -- to help change the way we behave, the
      way we think of ourselves.    ,Examine what together you might do to help
      us rebuild the frayed bonds of community, to give children nonviolent ways
      to resolve their frustrations.DS

              Today, the entertainment industry is helping parents limit
      childrenD,s exposure to violence -- working with the administration on a
      voluntary ratings system for television and parental screening for the
      Internet.  But there is still too much violence on our nationD,s screens,
      large and small. There are too many creators and purveyors of violence
      who say there is nothing they can do about it.  And there are too many
"   .
    vulnerable children who are steeped in this culture of violence --
    becoming desensitized to it and, as studies show, more capable of
    committing it themselves.  By age 18, the typical American will see 40,000
    dramatized murders. All in the name of entertainment.

             Those who say they can do nothing about this are wrong.  By
    changing the way it does business, the entertainment industry can make a
    big difference.   Today, I am issuing a challenge to the entire
    entertainment industry -- to stop showing guns in any ads and previews
    children might see.   Second, I challenge theater owners across America to
    enforce more strictly the age requirements on the movies they show.   No
    theater owner should turn the other way as a child walks unchaperoned into
    an R-rated movie.   [And third, I am asking the Department of Justice and
    the Federal Trade Commission to study the extent to which the video game,
    television, music and movie industries market violence to children -- and
    whether those industries are abiding by their own vOluntary systems of
    self-regulation.]   Our administration is fighting to do everything we can
    to protect our children. The entertainment industry should do the same.

            Across America, people are coming together and saying, yes, we can
    change this culture of violence.  I believe that we will -- and that we
    can build, in its place, a culture of values which we would be proud to
    pass on to future generations. Thank you.
