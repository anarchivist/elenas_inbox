  Here are the Q and A's with Elena's changes.   She asked Bruce to look at
  the A. figure under the Q. money for states.   JRM thinks the figure is $26
  billion (but he's not certain you want to commit to having that exact
  figure in the budget) .==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

Q:    In September, the President said the focus of tobacco legislation should not be about
      money. In the budget you are submitting today, more than 60 percent of the
      proposed increase in discretionary spending is paid for by tobacco legislation. Why
      has the President changed course?

A:    The President's course has not changed -- Congress should send the President legislation
      that will dramatically reduce youth smoking. Experts all agree the single most important
      step we can take to reduce youth smoking is to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes
      significantly. That is why last September, and again in his State of the Union speech, the
      President called for Congress to pass legislation that raises cigarette prices by up to $1.50
      per pack over the next ten years as necessary to reduce youth smoking. Our budget
      simply scores that part of the President's plan, and allocates the revenues to programs that
      promote public health and assist children.

Q:    How can you assume revenues from tobacco legislation when it's not at all certain
      whether this legislation will pass?

A:    It is a normal part of th(! budget process to account for any revenues that will be raised
      from proposed legislation. And we believe strongly that Congress will pass
      comprehensive tobacco legislation this year. If everyone who says they are committ<;:d to
      protecting children from tobacco rolls up their sleeves and gets to work, we will pass a
      significant piece of legislation.

Q:    Doesn't attaching tobacco legislation to particular spending initiatives hurt the
      chance of passing this legislation?

A:    No. It is a normal part of the budget process to propose how to spend any revenues
      raised from proposed legislation. And we will work on a bipartisan basis with Congress
      if it has other ideas on the best way to allocate these revenues. There is no reason why
      allocation issues should hold up the process of comprehensive legislation.

Q:    How much money do you expect to raise from tobacco legislation next year? What
      about over five years? How did you come to this figure?

A:   . This budget is designed to reduce youth smoking by 30% in five years and 50% in seven
       years, which is the President's goal. We calculate that the necessary increase in the price
       per pack will result in about $10 billion in revenue next year and $65 billion over five
       years.

Q:    How much does your plan increase the cost of cigarettes?

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

     A:   In order to reach the President's goal of reducing youth smoking by 30% in five years,
          and 50% in seven years, this budget projects about a $1.10 increase in the price of
          cigarettes over five years.

     Q:    What programs is tobacco money used for in the budget?

     A:   In general, tobacco revenues go toward protecting public health and assisting children.
          First, the budget provides for funds for anti-smoking activities that will help us meet the
          goals of reducing youth smoking rates. In addition, there are funds in the budget to
          support the commitment the President made when he announced his plans for tobacco
          legislation in September to fund a dramatic expansion of health-related research in
          America. Finally, in recognition of the states' role in bringing suit against tobacco
          companies, the budget provides for a substantial amount of money to revert to the states.
           Some of this money can be used for any purpose. Other funds must be used on
          state-administered programs to assist children (specifically, for child care, Medicaid child
          outreach, and class size reduction).

     Q:        How much money is there for states in the budget?

     A:   The states will receive as much unrestricted money over five years as they would have
          received under the original settlement agreement ($26 billion). In addition, the states
          will receive more than $15 billion for state-administered programs to help children. This
          money represents the federal share of Medicaid recoveries, which the Administration has
          decided to return to the states for use in state-administered programs in recognition of the
          important role the states played in bringing about this litigation.

     Q:    Does your budget assume that the revenues from tobacco legislation will come from
          increased excise taxes, or from industry payments pursuant to a settlement?

     A:   The budget does not say how the funds will be raised: it is compatible either with
          increased excise taxes or with a schedule of industry payments established in a
          settlement.

     Q:   Last week, several Republicans came out against tobacco legislation that would
          grant the industry limits on liability. Many public health leaders are also saying
          that tobacco legislation must not include limits on liability. Does the president still
          favor a settlement that would probably include some limits on industry liability?

     A:   The President has detailed the five principles that he believes the tobacco legislation
          should be based on. Liability protection for the tobacco industry is not one of them. By
          the same token it is not a deal-breaker for us if we are able to achieve the President's five
          principles. What's important is achieving those principles through comprehensive
          legislation that includes, for example, a large per-pack price increase, penalties for
          marketing to children, and broad restrictions on children's access to tobacco.
don't mean that some members are seeking to walk away from their responsibility to
protect children by en~cting comprehensive tobacco legislation.

Piecemeal legislation won't accomplish our goal. It's not enough just to say we did
something if we don't pass comprehensive legislation that really accomplishes our goals.
