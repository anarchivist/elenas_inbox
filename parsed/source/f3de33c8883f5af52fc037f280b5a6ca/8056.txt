                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
Dear

        The Administration would support properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal
to transport minors across state lines for the purposes of avoiding parental involvement
requirements. The Administration appreciates the concerns of the sponsors ofS. 1645 about
fostering parental and family involvement in a minor's decision to obtain an abortion and their
concerns about overbearing and sometimes predatory adults who improperly influence minors'
abortion decisions. The Administration believes, however, that changes must be made to ensure
that S. 1645 is appropriately targeted at these important goals. If these changes are not made,
senior advisors would recommend a veto.'

        First, S. 1645 must be amended to exclude close family members from criminal and civil
penalty. Under the legislation, grandmothers, aunts, and adult siblings could face criminal
prosecution for coming to the aid of a relative in distress. Even a mother or father could be
exposed to criminal penalty if she or he resides in a state which requires the consent or
notification of both parents. Imposing criminal and civil sanctions on family members for
helping their relatives, however, does not further the interests of healthy family communications.
  Subjecting family members to criminal or civil sanction, moreover, would also further isolate
the minor by discouraging her from seeking advice and counsel from those closest to her.
Finally, creating a civil action which allows family mernbers to sue each other when a minor
within that family has an abortion does not serve the goal of fostering strong families.

        Second, S. 1645 must be amended to prevent punishing persons who simply provide
information, counseling, referral, or medical services to the minor. The bill as written, for
example, could potentially subject a telephone receptionist to civil or criminal liability merely for
informing an unnamed caller about the availability of abortion services. Holding such persons
criminally or civilly liable, however, does not further the interests in promoting family
communication or deterring those who would inappropriately transport minors across state line to
obtain abortions.

        The Justice Department has also identified a number of constitutional concerns that
inhere in particular aspects of the legislation. The Department will forward their concerns
subsequently and would be pleased to work with the sponsors in crafting legislation that
remedies those defects and the other matters noted above.

        The Administration is concerned that S. 1645, as written, represents a novel intrusion into
federalism and the rights ofstates to regulate mattes within their own boundaries. The
Administration believes, however, that legislation which reflects the concerns noted above, and
is carefully targeted towards punishing non-relatives who transport minors across state lines for
the purposes of avoiding parental irivolvement requirements, would serve to minimize the
federalism concerns.
