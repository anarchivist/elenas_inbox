        This is the last directive I gave to Phil Caplan tonight.   It contains
        changes to address Justice OLC's concerns.   I faxed it to Justice and
        Treasury.  I have every reason to believe this is the last version.

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

     SUBJECT:       Enforcing the Youth Handgun Safety Act

       A major problem in our nation today is the terrifYing ease with which our young people gain
     . illegal or unintended access to guns. Firearms are now responsible for 12 percent of fatalities
       among all American children and teenagers. Criminal use of firearms by young people is a
       national tragedy. Between 1984 and 1994, the number of juvenile offenders committing
       homicides by firearms nearly quadrupled. Moreover, firearms are the fourth leading cause of
       accidental deaths among chitdren ages 5-14 and are now the primary method by which young
       people commit suicide. A recent study supported by the Department of Justice found that
       slightly more than half of all privately owned firearms were stored unlocked and approximately
       one-third of all handguns were stored both loaded and unlocked. We must do all we can to
       prevent both illegal and unintended access to guns by juveniles.

     To address this issue, my Administration has consistently called for toughening our laws to help
     reduce youth gun violence. Specifically, we have fought for and gained passage of: (1) the
     Brady Act, to allow local law enforcement to conduct background checks before handguns are
     sold; (2) the Assault Weapons Ban, to keep deadly assault weapons off the streets; (3) the
     Gun-Free Schools Act, to establish a policy of "zero tolerance" for guns in our schools; and (4)
     the Youth Handgun Safety Act, to prohibit, in most circumstances, the transfer to or possession
     ofa handgun by a juvenile.

     More recently, we proposed comprehensive juvenile crime legislation that, among other things,
     would continue to crack down on youth gun violence by increasing penalties for transferring a
     firearm to juveniles, prohibiting violent juveniles from owning firearms as adults, and requiring
     federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to provide a child safety lock with every gun sold. I hope
     Congress will enact these important measures as soon as possible.

     Until Congress acts, however, there is more we can do to keep guns out of the hands of our
     nation's youth. Existing law already bans the transfer of handguns to minors and juvenile
     possession of handguns, except in specified circumstances, and grants the Treasury Department
     authority to prescribe rules and regulations to implement this provision. I direct you to take the
     authorized steps necessary to enforce the provisions of the Youth Handgun Safety Act -- and
     specifically, consistent with your statutory authority, to promptly publish in the Federal Register
     proposed regulations requiring that signs be posted on the premises of FFLs and that written
     notification be issued with each handgun sold to non-licensees warning that:

             (I)    federal law prohibits, except in certain limited circumstances, anyone under the
                    age of 18 from knowingly possessing a handgun, or any adult from transferring a
                    handgun to such a minor;

             (2)    violation of the prohibition of transferring a handgun to a minor is, under certain


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




                      circumstances, punishable for up to 10 years in prison;

              (3)     handguns are a leading contributor to juvenile violence and fatalities; and

              (4)     safely storing and locking handguns away from children can help ensure
                      compliance with federal law.

       I also direct you to provide me with a written status report within 60 days on how you will carry
       out this directive.

       Your implementation of this directive will help inform gun purchasers about their responsibility
       under federal law to keep handguns from our children. It will also ensure that gun purchasers
       are warned about the frequency with which handguns kill or injure our kids.

       WJC
