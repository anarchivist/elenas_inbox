TEXT:
I talked to Gruber last night about doing something on international
tobacco control. My thought was we might want some event and action the
President could take to show publicly he is keeping momentum on tobacco
while we are waiting for Congress to come back and the bills to move.
This wouldn't be more money, but something like plans with other nations
to help control smuggling. He thought there was stuff to do.   Interested?
