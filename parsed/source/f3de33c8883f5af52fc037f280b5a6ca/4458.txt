Pg 4 strike 2d and 3d paragraphs beginning "Our paramount concern ... " and insert:

       Reducing teen smoking has always been America's bottom line. It must be the tobacco
       industry'S bottom line as well. To achieve this important goal, the Administration
       believes tobacco legislation must include stiff penalties that give the tobacco industry the
       strongest possible incentive to stop targeting kids. Legislation should set ambitious
       targets to cut teen smoking by 30% in 5 years, 50% in 7 years, and 60% in 10 years, and
       impose severe financial penalties that hold tobacco companies accountable to meet those
       targets. The Administration supports penalties that are non-deductible, uncapped,
       company or brand specific, and escalating -- so that the penalties get stiffer and the price
       goes up the more that companies miss the targets.


Pg 5 insert the following new paragraph after "Counter Advertising and Education Campaigns"

       To succeed in reducing youth smoking, legislation must provide for a nationwide effort to
       deglamorize tobacco, warn young people of its addictive nature and deadly consequences,
       and help parents discourage their children from taking up the habit. Legislation should
       provide for a public education and counter advertising campaign, as well as state and
       local prevention efforts. The Administration also supports stronger, more visible
       warning labels on tobacco products.


Pg 8 strike pages 8 through 11 and insert instead:

       In the long run, the agency must have maximum regulatory flexibility to protect all
       Americans, smokers and non-smokers, from the dangers of tobacco products as currently
       designed. FDA must be free to move as quickly as possible to oversee the development
       and introduction of reduced-risk, less addictive nicotine-containing products.

       Mr. Chairman, let me be clear, we will never lose sight of the 50 million Americans who
       currently use tobacco products. As we have said many times, we believe strongly that
       prohibition will not work and we will not achieve our public health goals by merely
       denying adults access to the nicotine-containing tobacco products they crave. But no
       consumer product should be allowed to maintain a marketplace based on addiction.
       Seventy percent of current adult smokers want to quit smoking completely. We must do
       more to help these 30 million Americans. We need an unfettered FDA hard at work on
       seeing reduced-risk, less addictive products become a reality in the marketplace.

       In 1996, the Administration took the historic step of asserting FDA jurisdiction over
       tobacco products. Since that time, the Administration has said it would support federal
       legislation explicitly affirming the FDA's authority to regulate the manufacture,
       marketing, and sale oftobacco products. Under such legislation, the FDA's authority
       over tobacco products must be as effective as its authority over other drugs and devices,
       and must be sufficiently flexible to meet changing circumstances. The legislation should
                                                                  Ik,.Dump Conversion

       not impose any obligation on the FDA to make specific findings about such speculative
       matters as the creation of contraband markets; nor should it impose any special
       procedural hurdles or requirements, such as enhanced standards of proof or unusual
       evidentiary formalities.


Pg 12 insert the following paragraph after the first paragraph:

       To fully appreciate the behavior of the tobacco industry I want to share with you and the
       members of the committee a story we were told by a state official during one of our
       outreach meetings. As a public health professional he had devoted his entire career to
       combating public health hazards -- from infectious diseases such as tuberculosis to
       chronic illnesses such as cancer where his job involves changing individual behavior.
       Tobacco use was the only public health challenge that fought back. He described
       industry practices that included hiring the best attorneys in town, and an ensuing pattern
       of harassment. It begins with hand-tying letters, soon their file cabinets were being
       carted off and the contents were being xeroxed, then came the unfounded personal attacks
       appearing in the media. He concluded that it was as if the makers of high fat food
       products set out to fire all of the nutritionists.


Pg 13 insert the following new header and paragraph following the first paragraph:

       Corporate Compliance

       Tobacco companies should set up comprehensive corporate compliance programs that
       will reinforce the real economic incentives provided by the youth smoking penalties to
       discourage companies from marketing to children. The legislation should establish
       oversight mechanisms to investigate and monitor corporate compliance and to make
       recommendations to Congress on appropriate future legislation.


Pg 13 insert the following new paragraph at the bottom of the page:

       Federal tobacco legislation provides an opportunity not only to reduce youth smoking, but
       to meet other public health goals: the reduction of environmental (second-hand) tobacco
       smoke, the expansion of smoking cessation programs, the strengthening of international
       efforts to control tobacco, and the provision of funds for health research and other health
       objectives.


Pg 16 insert the following sentence at the end of the first paragraph:

       Legislation should also help enable smoking cessation services to reach and assist the
       millions of smokers who want to break their addiction to tobacco products.
                                                                  H.:x-Dump Conversion
Pg 16 strike the 2d and 3d paragraphs and insert the following:

        As President Clinton said last week, federal tobacco legislation must aim not only
       to reduce youth smoking, but to meet other health goals as well, including
       strengthening of international prevention and cessation programs and
       strengthening of international efforts to control tobacco. We recently heard from
       the world's health experts in Beijing about how tobacco will become the leading
       preventable cause of death in the world by the year 2020. By 2025, tobacco will
       claim 10 million lives each year. Seventy percent of these deaths will occur in
       developing countries, countries which truly cannot afford the high social, economic
       and medical costs incurred as a consequence of tobacco use. But the opportunities
       for prevention are real - people in developing countries have not yet taken up the
       habit to the degree that we have in the United States and in other developed
       countries.

       There is much that we can do to assist other countries interested in our help,
       bilaterally and multilaterally, through official channels and international
       institutions as well as through non-governmental organizations. At a minimum, we
       should give greater priority to preventing global tobacco use by increasing our
       investments in this area and taking a leadership role in mobilizing the international
       health community to discourage young people from starting to smoke and to
       encourage those that have the habit to quit. We are aware that the resources that
       we currently can bring to bear are paltry by comparison to the marketing power of
       the international tobacco industry. This makes it all the more imperative that we
       begin to take stronger, more concerted actions now.

       As far as tobacco is concerned, our international priorities should be the same as
       our domestic priorities. Consistent with domestic policy and international trade
       rules, it is the policy of the Clinton Administration to not interfere with a foreign
       country's non-discriminatory health-based efforts to control the use of tobacco.
       The Department of Health and Human Services will continue to collaborate with the
       U.S. Trade Representative and provide a health perspective in the trade policy
       process. HHS is also working with the Departments of State, Commerce and
       Agriculture in developing appropriate guidelines for dealing with tobacco issues
       overseas. Our U.S. embassies and missions should not to engage in activities that
       are likely to stimulate the demand for tobacco products, or increase tobacco use,
       especially among young people. While we should always protect American
       business interests to ensure fair and equal business practices, our trade and
       commercial actions should do no more than seek to ensure equal access to a
       shrinking global tobacco market.




Pg 17 insert the following sentence at the beginning of the paragraph following the heading
                                                                                   ocorcs Management system
                                                                       \ulC'mated R-
                                                                       Hex.-Dump conversion
     "Resources for Health Research ... ":

            The Administration believes that the primary objective of tobacco legislation is to reduce
            youth smoking, not to raise money.


     Pg 19 insert the following at the end ofthe first sentence at the bottom of the page:

            We have a responsibility to these people. They haven't done anything wrong. As the
            President said last week: ''They're good, hard-working, tax-paying citizens, and they have
            not caused this problem. And we cannot let them, their families or their communities
            just be crippled and broken by this."

            Mr. Chairman, we're trying to change America and make everybody whole. Framers and
            their communities deserve a chance to have their lives and be made whole and go on with
            the future as well, and I can say I speak for the President and his entire Administration
            when I say we are determined to see that they're a part of this.
