TEXT:
The USSS is still experiencing problems with the South Court Gate which
has caused it to be up and down over the last week. The manufacturer has
been called in today to assess the problem. We will let you know when the
gate is operational again.

The USSS will place a sign on West Executive Avenue when the South Court


Gate is closed directing you to the Southwest Gate to exit West Executive
Avenue.  If the gate cannot be fixed today, this sign will be in place.

Please call Management and Administration with any questions at x62861.
We apologize for any inconvenience.
