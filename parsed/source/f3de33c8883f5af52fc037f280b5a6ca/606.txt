TEXT:
Elena:  I just left you a voice mail saying that we're postponing the GI
bill meeting that was scheduled for today until Mon or Tues of next week.
I'll let you know when we reschedule.  (I'm assuming you got my voice mail
the other day about the meeting). OMB wanted someone from DPC attending
-- I was referred to you.

I'll keep you posted.
