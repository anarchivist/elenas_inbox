We do not have a plan for helping DC meet our reading and math standards
as far as I know, though I have not been in the middle of whatever DC
discussions have been going on.

However, if we were smart we would at least be pushing for a DC reads
initiative, that could be a model for the country. This would go well
beyond announcing work-study tutors; it would include administering NAEP
to individual kids; mobilizing a large number of reading tutors,
especially federal employees in addition to college students and lawyers;
creating an integrated, community-wide effort as in Boston Reads, which
involves area universities (for expert help, not just tutors), hospital
and pediatricians, employers, libraries, Head Start programs, etc., and,
working with the schools to improve curriculum and professional
development.

This is on my list of things to discuss with Carol today, assuming we have
better luck connecting than in previous days.

I know that Mike Smith and Frank Raines have been working on a DC
initiative--perhaps closely, perhaps not. However, DC has not come close
to the top of the list of things I have to talk to, so they may be further
along than I think.
