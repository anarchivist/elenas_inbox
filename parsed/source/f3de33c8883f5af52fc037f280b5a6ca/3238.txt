I have calculated our slots and gave you an incorrect number this
morning. Here is the actual breakdown:

DPC/White House Slots

As of today, we are fully staffed on the DPC and White House payrolls.
All 11 and 1/3 DPC slots are staffed (including Mia Masten and Mark
Mazur). With today's addition of Essence Washington, we now have 12 slots
on the White House payroll (including the AIDs Tsar and her deputy, Nicole
Rabner, and Carrie Greenstein -- the 1st Lady's researcher.  I am not
counting Ira Magaziner, but if you did, DPC would have 13 White House
slots) .

My understanding from Elizabeth is that she is planning to leave in
mid-August.  I am not certain when Prince is corning on board. However,
that will give us 2 DPC openings this summer.

Detailees

As of today, we have 4 open detail slots. However, as of mid-July, three
of those slots will be filled.  Linda Cooper is arriving on July 7, Tanya
Oubre is starting July 14, and Allison Balderston (Mike's assistant) is
corning on July 21. That leaves the DPC with only 1 open detail slot.

TOTAL

Thus, we will have 3    slots starting in August. This would make it
difficult to provide    a slot to the Lady's office.  I would note, that we
already provide them    with 3 staffers (including carrie greenstein), and we
continue to have Ira    and Mia on our payrolls.

The current proposal for how we utilize these slots are:

1-- Race Initiative/Urban(?)
2-- Public Health


3-- Welfare/Urban (?)
