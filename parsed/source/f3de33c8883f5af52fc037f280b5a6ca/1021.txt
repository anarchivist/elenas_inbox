TEXT:
I have a memo here from Coelho to Vicki about attendees for the meeting
with Erskine.   They want to do the big meeting (w/ EBB) on March 6 at
3pm.   I don't know if this gives us enough time, but we should discuss.
I'm at 6-2128.   Thanks,
-Angus

ps - Thanks for taking on the Black Farmers for now. As soon as the
Special Asst. to the POTUS for farm policy is named (I think it's going to
be Charles Whillock), we can have him take over.
