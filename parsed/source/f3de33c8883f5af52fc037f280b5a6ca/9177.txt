TEXT:
HHS has been approached by Triad Communications, the company that Philip
Morris, Lorillard, and the Tobacco Institute hired to put its company
documents in computer format.  Triad says they can convert the documents
to an easily searchable form and that PM public relations officials have
indicated an interest in paying the cost, thinking this could bring them
good publicity.  PM's board of directors has not yet been consulted.  HHS
is skeptical but would like to obtain more information.  Is that OK?

More broadly, HHS and DOJ are making decent progress in fulfilling the
requirements of the President's memorandum (we've been making them report
to us in biweekly conference calls to keep them on track).  DOJ is working
with FDA to draft its brief to make the IVA index public -- the district
court has not yet set a due date, but DOJ expects them to set one in
mid-Sept. HHS has done a lot of leg work on the documents, including
sending a CDC team to Minnesota, and is pulling together a group of
research and information technology specialists to discuss options at an
all-day meeting next Friday (Sept. 11th).
