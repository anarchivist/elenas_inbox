TEXT:
Below is a list of targeted cities developed at the satellite meeting on
Friday, Oct. 2.  please review the list and return it by fax (with edits)
to Michael King or Michael Grantham at 456-5558 or delivery to OEOB room
149.  The best number to reach Michael King or Michael Grantham for the
next two days is 456-5463.

The list below will be redistributed with your edits and suggestions at
the next satellite meeting on Wednesday.  Notification of the location and
time of that meeting will follow.  The actual contact for the day to day
operations will most likely be different from the name that we portray to
the public as the host of the individual satellite downlink site.  It is
important that you list the individual that you feel would best represent
the conference to the public, such as a particular Mayor, state AG or 0
ther official.  At Wednesday's meeting we can review the updated list of
targeted cities and decide which of the 42 cities and states should be
focused on, and who should lead those events.
