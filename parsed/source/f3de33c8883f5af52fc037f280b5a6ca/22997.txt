BR/EK:

Unanticipated Crime Hearing. Tomorrow the House Government Reform
Committee (Chairman Dan Burton) will host a hearing on successful crime
reduction programs, with Mayor Guiliani of New York as the star witness.
I don't know if this will make any news or not, but it has the potential
to make raise issues related to our COPS proposal, the police brutality
issue, etc.  Also testifying will be Commissioner John Timoney of
Philadelphia (and formerly of New York) and Harry Shorestein, the DA of
Jacksonville, Florida. Rep. Blagojevich of Chicago, IL, will be there to
pitch for our community prosecutors initiative.

Reorganization of the Office of Justice Programs. Tomorrow at 11:30am,
Chuck Ruff, Bob Nash and I will meet w/DOJ reps on a proposed
reorganization of the Office of Justice Programs (OJP).   As you know, OJP
oversees most state and local crime programs (minus COPS) and maintains a
high degree of independence from main Justice.   The proposed
reorganization would help centralize OJP's authority (good for us), but
would also do away with 5 PAS slots at DOJ (not good for us, or at least
not for WH Personal).   I don't necessarily have strong feelings about the
proposal, but Bob Nash might. The AG has not made any final decisions and
wants to know our thoughts.   The report is due to DOJ's appropriators at
the start of next week.
