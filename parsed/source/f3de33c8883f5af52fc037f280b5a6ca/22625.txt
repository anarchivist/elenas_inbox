EK:

Require gun show promoters to register with ATF.  Promoters would be
required to: provide the time and location of every gun show and a list of
all vendors; ensure that all vendors are given information about their
legal obligations; and require vendors to acknowledge receipt of it.
Failure to fulfill these obligations could result in revocation or
suspension of registration or civil or criminal penalties.

Report information on firearms sold to ATF's National Tracing Center.  Gun
dealers would be required to submit certain limited information (e.g.,
manufacturer, model, and serial number) on all firearms transferred at gun
shows to ATF's NTC and to maitain files with additional information -- as
gun dealers currently do with guns sold in stores -- to assist in future
firearms trace requests by law enforcement.
