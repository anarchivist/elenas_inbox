TEXT:
fyi -- This decision (Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563, 1974) came up in the
CA bilingual meeting this week.  In answer to Elena's question, it was a
Douglas decision, joined by Brennan, Marshall, Powell, and Rehnquist(!).
There were three opinions concurring in the result: Stewart, joined by B
urger and Blackmun; White; and Blackmun, joined by Burger.   The claim was
based on equal protection and Title VI, but the decision was based on
Title VI alone (did not reach the 14th Amendment grounds).
