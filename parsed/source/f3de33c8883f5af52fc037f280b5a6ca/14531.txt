            TALKING POINTS ON THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
                          Monday, February 3, 1997

       A concrete action plan. In his Inaugural address, President Clinton presented his larger
vision of preparing America for the 21 st Century. In the State of the Union and budget, the
President will present his clear, concrete and consistent action plan to implement that vision.

       At a time of peace and prosperity, our great enemy is inaction. The President will
emphasize the unique opportunity America faces to build on the strong economic foundation we
have established, and also the importance of taking action now to share the 21st Century.

         Balancing the budget to keep the economy strong and investing in critical priorities.
 The President will demonstrate that he has moved the country beyond the false choices of the
past -- that we can finish the work of balancing the budget, to lower interest rates and keep the
economy growing, while still investing in those things that help the American people thrive and
our economy grow.

        Working together with all sectors of society. The President will stress the
responsibility shared by all sectors of society (states, localities, businesses, communities and
families) to work together to meet our challenges. In his address, he will issue a call to action
that must be answered by all Americans, and he will highlight those who are already stepping up
to the challenge of preparing America for the 21 st Century.

       Key points to emphasize: education, leadership in the world and unity. The
President's address will place a special focus on these three areas -- giving our children a
world-class education for the 21st Century, remaining the world's indispensable nation, and
forming a stronger, more perfect union here at home.

                STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS -- THEMATIC OUTLINE
                              Monday, February 3, 1997

         1. Finishing the unrmished bnsiness of onr country. The President will open with a
. strong statement of his determination to finish the job of balancing the budget, refonning welfare
  and refonning campaign finance laws, to lay the foundation for preparing America for the 21 st
  Century.

         2. Strengthening education as the number-one priority. The President will
 emphasize that nothing is more important to preparing America for the 21st Century than giving
 our children a world-class education. That is why the President is proposing the largest
 education budget in history, providing record investments from pre-school to high school to
 college, and he is focussing on the responsibility all families and communities share to renew our
 schools at all levels. His address will place a special focus on the need to set the highest
 standards for students, teachers and schools.

         3. Harnessing the powerful forces of knowledge, science, and technology. In the first
 State of the Union to be carried live over the Internet, the President will discuss his plans to
 spread the benefits of technology and research to all Americans, from our schools to our hospitals
 to our homes.

         4. Building stronger families to help parents pass on their values to their children,
 and stronger communities to prepare America for the 21st Century. The President will talk
 about the need to strengthen America's families by expanding Family Leave, and continuing to
 expand access to health care step-by-step; and the need to strengthen our communities by
 revitalizing urban communities, protecting our environment, pressing the fight against crime and
 drugs, expanding national service and celebrating culture and the arts.

        5. Keeping American leadership strong. The President will place a special focus on
 keeping America strong, by maintaining our role as the world's indispensable nation. This
 includes building an undivided, democratic Europe; building an Asian-Pacific community;
 prospering in the global economy; remaining a force for peace throughout the world; moving
 strongly against new threats to our security, and maintaining the tools to meet these challenges.

        6. Remaining strong as One America. Following through on his Inaugural address, the
 President will issue a strong call for unity -- emphasizing that our diversity is a great strength as
 we move into the 21 st Century.
