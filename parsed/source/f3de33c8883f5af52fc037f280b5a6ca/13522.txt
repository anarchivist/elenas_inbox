TEXT:
As the sole member of the campaign finance reform kitchen cabinet,
it seems to me that we are missing an opportunity to do more about
the free tv issue.
It seems from the op-eds and other things I've seen that the
blueblood community -- Walter Cronkite etc. -- is petitioning the
FCC to do free tv.
Should the administration join their petition or take a position?
I would say yes, though we need to carefuly vet it with the press
and communications office, as well as political, since the
industry can't be very happy . . . also, it may violate
understandings we have with the industry reo tv violence (I hope
not) .
This is a chance to actually do something good.
