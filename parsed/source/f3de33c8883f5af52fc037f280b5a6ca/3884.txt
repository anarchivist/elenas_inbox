TEXT:
We got a proposal from Leslie Bryne, Office of Consumer Affairs, to do a
consumer handbook on child care.   It would include: what questions to ask
providers,  a compendium of state and local laws, where to make complaints
about quality of care, and tips on what to look for.    They say it would
cost $80-100,000.   Is there something like thi.s in the works? What do you
think?
