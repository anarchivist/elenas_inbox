Washington, D.C. 20515



Dear Mr. Speaker:

        The American people expect reliable service from their
Government.  They deserve the confidence that critical government
functions dependent on computer and other electronic systems will be
performed accurately and in a timely manner.

        The Federal Government is continuing its intensive effort to make
sure that these systems work in the year 2000.  I have personal:ly
instructed my Cabinet to make the year 2000 problem (Y2K) a top priority,
and my Council on Year 2000 Conversion is working hard to coordinate
agency efforts not only to prepare their systems for the new millennium,
but to increase awareness of the problem among public, private, and
international organizations outside of the Government.

        In the FY 1999 Budget, I requested more than $1 billion for Y2K
computer conversion.  In addition, my budget anticipated that additional
requirements would emerge, and included an allowance for emergencies and
other unanticipated needs.

        While, at this time, I believe that the resource levels included
in my budget will fully address the GovernmentD,s anticipated Y2K
requirements, ensuring Government-wide compliance will require the
flexibility to respond to unanticipated needs in a timely fashion as we
learn more about the problem.  Last week, the House Appropriations
Committee took a step to provide such flexibility, and I understand the
Senate Appropriations Committee will make a similar effort.

        I am very concerned, however, that the House will soon consider
proposals to eliminate this flexibility from the Defense and
Treasury/General Government appropriations bills. This shortsighted
action would only serve to create delay on an issue where time is one
resource we cannot afford to waste.

        With only 555 days until January 1, 2000, it is important that
agencies are provided funds to address known Y2K needs, and the
flexibility to seek additional funding for unanticipated requirements.  I
urge the House to provide the necessary flexibility to address the year
2000 problem.

Sincerely,
Bill Clinton
