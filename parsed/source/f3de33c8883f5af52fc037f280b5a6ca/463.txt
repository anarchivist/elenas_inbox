TEXT:
I personally believe that HHS is wrong on this one.   I have never
been comfortable with the all or nothing requirement on optional
benefits.  I believe it puts us in a position where some Governors
may say, for example, I would not kick those elderly immigrants
out of nursing homes if the Feds did not make me cover every
eligibility category in order for me to prevent this.   I simply do
not have the money for everyone. Along these lines, the all or
nothing approach serves, in my opinion, as a disincentive for some
states to even consider covering these optional benefits.
As I understand it from Pauline and Nancy Ann, Diana, you did not
reach final closure on this one yet? What is your reading on the
state of play? What is your feeling on this issue at this point?
