TEXT:
The California Children and Families First Initiative (proposition 10)
proposes a 50 cent per pack tax on cigarettes. It will raise $700 million
annually for anti-tobacco and early childhood development initiatives.
20% of revenues will go toward statewide initiatives (of this, 6% will go
to a statewide media campaign designed to encourage pregnant women and
parents of young children to stop smoking; the remainder will go to child
care and early childhood development programs). The remaining 80% will go
to the counties for them to use as they see fit for a very broad range of
children's programs, which may also include assistance to pregnant women
and parents of young children who want to quit smoking, and education and
training programs on the avoidance of tobacco, drugs and alcohol .

Rob Reiner has spearheaded the effort, and supporters include Koop,
Waxman, Boxer, and 250-300 groups including the American Cancer Society,
American Heart Association, American Lung Association, California Medical
Association, child care organizations, a law enforcement organization,
religious organizations, education groups, etc.  The Mayors of LA,
Sacramento and San Francisco are supporters, along with Michael Huffington
(he is a major contributor). Wilson has not yet taken a position yet, nor
has Feinstein (she proposed her own ballot initiative when she ran for
Governor which included a $1 per pack tax increase for education purposes,
but it didn't go anywhere).  Feinstein also apparently has some concerns
about spending accountability -- I will try to find out more about that.

The only known opposition so far is the Committee Against Unfair Taxes,
which is sponsored by the industry.  The industry apparently has not been
successful in recruiting to its side either the major anti-tax groups or
law enforcement groups, in part because they apparently embarrassed their
supporters 10 years ago during the last tobacco tax initiative. The
industry plans to come out swinging in the upcoming months, but they
haven't been very vocal yet.  I only found one editorial opposing the
initiative, and the complaints sound very familiar (Creates 59 new
government commissions, "with friends like Rob Reiner, the poor in
California don't need enemies", blah, blah).

The ballot initiative will be voted on in November.   Proponents said that


they collected the 1.2 signatures to qualify for the ballot rather
easily. One recent poll shows 68% are in favor of the initiative.
Another one shows that 54% are in favor, 32% oppose.

A tobacco tax ballot initiative has never been voted down in California.
10 years ago, proposition 99 passed, which increased taxes by 25 cents a
pack, mostly for health care\public health purposes.   Proponents say that
it cut smoking in CA by about a third.   (During that ballot initiative,
the industry outspent proponents by 10 to 1, but the initiative passed by
a 10 point margin anyway.)  About 6 years ago, the CA legislature passed
an additional 2 cent per pack for the Breast Cancer Fund.    Current state
taxes on cigarettes are 37 cents a pack.

Nicole said that Reiner met with Mrs. Clinton and urged her to speak out
publicly in favor of the initiative.  She is supportive of his efforts,
but has not committed to doing anything.
