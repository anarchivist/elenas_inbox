H.R. 4380 -- DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY 1999
(Sponsors:  Livingston (R); Louisiana; Taylor (R), North Carolina)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
Administrationo,s views on H.R. 4380, the District of Columbia
Appropriations Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations
Committee.

        The Administration appreciates the Committeeo,s support in
developing a bill that provides sufficient Federal funding to implement
the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government and Improvement
Act of 1997 successfully. While the Committee bill is an improvement over
the Subcommittee version of the bill, the Administration is deeply
concerned about inadequate funding for the D.C. economic development
initiative and objects to a number of provisions of the Committee bill, as
described below. We urge the House to adopt a bill that addresses the
Administrationo,s concerns.

Economic Development Initiative

        The Administration has requested $100 million for an economic
development initiative in the District of Columbia:  $50 million to
capitalize the locally-chartered National Capital Revitalization
Corporation (NCRC), $25 million for critically needed management reforms
authorized by the Revitalization Act and related to the cit yO,s economic
development infrastructure, and $25 million for Metrorail improvements
that would support the Washington Convention Center project. We
appreciate the Committeeo,s action to provide $25 million to support
transportation improvements associated with the Washington Convention
Center, as requested, as well as $21 million for infrastructure
improvements in the District.  However, we regret that the Committee has
provided no funding for critically needed management reforms or funding to
capitalize the locally-chartered NCRC.  The Administration strongly urges
the Committee to appropriate additional resources for economic
development.

Public Education

        The Administration appreciates the Committeeo,s full support of
charter schools and other public schools in the District and supports the
Committeeo,s appropriation of $20.4 million in Federal funding for D.C.
charter schools.

Abortion



           The Administration strongly opposes the abortion language of the
COllUlIittee bill, which would prohibit the use of both Federal and District
funds to pay for abortions except in those cases where the life of the
mother is endangered or in situations involving rape or incest. The
Administration continues to view the prohibition on the use of local funds
as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of the District and would
support an amendment, if offered, to strike this prohibition.

 Micromanagement

        The Administration opposes provisions of the Committee bill that
would further restrict or otherwise condition management of the District
Government, thereby undercutting the Financial Responsibility and
Management Assistance Authority's (the Authority's) oversight and
responsibility for the District's budget and financial condition.
Further, the Administration is concerned about provisions that would
undermine the responsibilities of the Superintendent of the District of
Columbia Public Schools by legislating how local funds are used for
salaries and pay raises.

        Reducing teen smoking is a high priority of the Administration;
therefore, we support the objective of the amendment made in order related
to the possession of tobacco products by minors.  However, for the same
reason that Congress has not legislated specific laws for individual
States, it would be inappropriate to do so for the District of Columbia.
Presently, the District of Columbia law bans the sale of tobacco to minors
under 18 years of age. We urge the House to modify this amendment to make
it a sense of the Congress amendment.

        The Administration understands that an amendment may be offered that
would strike restrictions on funding the District of Columbia Advisory
Neighborhood Commission. The Administration supports this amendment.

        The Administration is committed to working with the House to
produce a bill that will assist the District in its continued efforts
toward financial recovery. We look forward to working with the House to
address our mutual concerns.

Objectionable Amendments

        The Administration understands that three amendments may be
offered that would seriously undermine local control.  If such amendments
were adopted and included in the bill presented to the President, his
senior advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.

 An amendment to provide for the use of private school vouchers in the
District. We would strongly oppose any legislation allowing the use of
Federal taxpayer funds for private school vouchers.  Instead of investing
additional resources in public schools, vouchers would allow a few
selected students to attend private schools and would draw resources and
attention away from the hard work of reforming public schools that serve
the overwhelming majority of D.C. students.  Establishing a private school
voucher system in the NationD,s Capital would set a dangerous precedent
for using Federal taxpayer funds for schools that are not accountable to
the public.

 An amendment that would prohibit adoptions in the District by couples
that are unmarried or not related by blood.


 An amendment that would prohibit the use of Federal and local funds for
needle exchange programs and would prohibit private agencies from
supporting needle exchange programs if they receive Federal or local funds
(even if the funds used for the needle exchange programs are their ow~) .
