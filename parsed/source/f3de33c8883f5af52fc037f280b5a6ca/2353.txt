TEXT:
It is in the Hotline today.     The tobacco industry's chief negotiator gave

them an interview.     Perhaps I misread it, and the "document" the

negotiator was referring to was the settlement agreement itself -- but

basically, he was asked if he was in negotiations with the WH and said

that that was not quite the right term to describe his dialogue, but then

said he had delivered a document to the WH that spelled out how far the

industry would go ....



In addition, he certainly seemed to rule out that the tax bill tax credit

would be added on top of the $368 billion in the settlement ....
