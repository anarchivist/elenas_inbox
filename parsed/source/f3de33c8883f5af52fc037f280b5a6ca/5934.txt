TEXT:
Julie and I met with DOJ and INS yesterday to discuss the elimination of
245i and its effect on battered immigrant women. With the elimination of
245i, these womeri now have to return to their home countries while their
visa applications are pending.   Senator Kennedy is working on a bill, and
DOJ is going to have a meeting with his staff to discuss the language and
timing.  INS is working on analyzing the data to determine how many
immigrant women we could anticipate would be affected every year by the
elimination of 245i. After DOJ meets with Kennedy's staff, we will hold
another meeting to see where we are.   Thanks, Mary
