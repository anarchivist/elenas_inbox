                                         June 6,1997


MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:         Bruce Reed
              Elena Kagan

RE:           DPC Weekly Report

       1. Ways and'Means Subcommittee Markup: On Thursday, the Ways and Means
Subcommittee on Human Resources reported out welfare legislation with many provisions
inconsistent with the budget agreement and to which we have strongly objected. The
Subcommittee bill does include a $3 billion welfare-to-work proposal, which we have praised for
meeting many of our priorities.

        The Subcommittee's immigration proVISIOns are clearly contrary to the negotiated,
bipartisan budget agreement policy to restore a minimum safety net for disabled legal
immigrants. The Subcommittee's proposal would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits only to
immigrants already receiving benefits prior to August 23, 1996; by contrast, the bipartisan
budget agreement policy would restore SSI and Medicaid benefits to any immigrant in the
country as of that date who is or becomes disabled. The Ways and Means Subcommittee
proposal would protect 75,000 fewer immigrants than the budget agreement by the year 2002.
The disability and aging groups support our position, not Ways and Means'. The Leadership
Council of Aging Organizations and the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities sent a letter
saying that while they would still like to cover even more legal immigrants than the budget
agreement, they will not support "any reductions in benefits to immigrants with disabilities in
order to provide them to other groups of immigrants." The states (NGA, APWA, and NCSL)
sent a generic statement saying they strongly believe that the termination of benefits to legal
immigrants who were in the U.S. before enactment of the welfare law should be rectified --
essentially taking no position on the differences between the budget agreement and the Ways and
Means proposal.

       The Subcommittee narrowed even further the provisions of the budget agreement by
adding at markup a provision which would deny SSI benefits to any legal immigrant whose
sponsor has income higher than $40,000. Because in the past sponsors did not sign legally
binding affidavits of support (last year's immigration law changed that) we have opposed
proposals like these because they would leave many legal immigrants without assistance if their
sponsor refused them help.

        We also strongly opposed the Subcommittee's proposal which would amend the welfare
law so that welfare recipients engaged in workfare would not be employees for the purposes of
the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other federal law. Although requiring the minimum wage
for hours worked, the proposal would permit states to count child care, Medicaid, and housing
benefits in their calculation of the minimum wage. It would also allow states to count additional
hours of job search, education, and training toward the welfare law's work requirements. We
argued that this provision is clearly outside the scope of the budget agreement, and that it creates
a subminimum wage for workfare participants and weakens the welfare law's work requirements.


        We· are pleased with the Subcommittee's $3 billion welfare-to-work proposal. As a
result of our extensive discussions with the Subcommittee, their new legislation directs a
substantial portion of the money to the 100 cities with the most poor people. Most of the money
given to the states will automatically be passed through to areas of high poverty and high
unemployment and long-term welfare dependency (primarily cities), and spending will be
controlled by PICs appointed by mayors. Needless to say, the states strongly oppose directing
funds to local agencies. They strongly believe the funds should be provided directly to the
states, which should have the flexibility to determine how and where to use them. On our two
other priorities, performance and displacement, the Ways and Means Subcommittee is still open
to some form of performance bonus, but adamantly opposes nondisplacement language.

        2. Study Overstates Difficulty of Meeting Welfare Law's Work Requirements: Last
week's Wall St. Journal reported on a new study's findings that, as early as 1998, most state
economies will not generate enough low-skilled private sector jobs to absorb welfare recipients
required to work by the welfare law. According to the study by Regional Financial Associates,
nationwide only 54% of those who must work can be absorbed in that year. Only 13 states are
able to provide all the jobs needed, led by Nevada, Utah, and Idaho; while 21 states can't provide
even half of the jobs needed -- with New York able to provide only 13% of the jobs needed.
The study argues that public workfare will have to fill this considerable gap.

        However, the study paints a false picture for 1998 by failing to account for several critical
factors, the most important of which is the dramatic caseload reductions that have already
occurred and that states are permitted to count toward the work requirements. The caseload
drop of roughly 18% since 1995 counts toward 1998's 30% work participation rates. In addition,
the study ignores the fact that approximately one-quarter of the caseload is exempt from the work
requirements for various reasons.

        Correcting roughly for these factors, in the aggregate the economy can easily meet the
1998 work requirements. This does mask differences among states -- some states with below
average growth rates and/or caseload reductions may not be able to generate enough private
sector jobs even in 1998. The harder prediction is for the year 2000 because of the difficulty of
predicting the economy's performance by then. The study did not address this question.



                                                 2

Elena: This summary may raise more questions than it answers. Although the study is dumb
and flawed, we haven't corrected it state by state, but just painted a rough aggregate picture, and
haven't updated it for 2000. We could do more over the next few weeks, but I wasn't sure if
you wanted this item in the interim, just to correct any misimpression that he may have.

FYI, Phil Levine of CEA confirms our criticisms.


       3. Pediatric Drug Labeling: We are working with the Food and Drug
Administration on a regulation that would require pharmaceutical companies to do
pediatric studies on certain new drugs and, in compelling circumstances, drugs that are
already on the market. The majority of drugs have not been tested for use by children.
As a result, children are given the wrong doses of drugs or are not given drugs at all
because physicians are reluctant to risk giving them inappropriate and possibly dangerous
amounts. For example, fewer than 10% of children with AIDS are receiving protease
inhibitors, the newest and most promising AIDS drugs, because these drugs have not been
tested for use by children.

The pediatric labeling regulation will be sent to OMB early next week. OMB will begin
its review process, but no action will be taken until after the markup of the FDA reform
bill in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee (which is expected to take
place next week). This regulation has strong support from children's health advocates,
particularly the pediatric AIDS community.
