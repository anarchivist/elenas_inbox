Nancy-Ann Min DeParle's Confirmation. The Republican Leadership has stepped up their
political gamesmanship on Nancy-Ann Min DeParle's nomination to be the Administrator of
HCFA. They are holding up a final confirmation vote over the 'Kyl amendment', which would
amend a compromise in the Balanced Budget Act. The BBA provision allowed physicians to
charge Medicare beneficiaries whatever fee they wished if beneficiaries voluntarily agreed to
waive Medicare payments on their behalf. Senator Kyl wishes to repeal the provision which
forbids physicians from serving any Medicare beneficiaries for two years whose services are paid
for by the program if they opt for these contracts.

The implications ofthe underlying compromise BBA provisions and the Kyl amendment to it are
quite complicated, but some accommodation may eventually be possible. However, the White
House and HHS feel strongly that we should not signal any willingness to consider modifying
this provision or even testify before the Congress (the Finance Committee has been instructed by
Senator Lott to hold a hearing on the subject) before Nancy-Ann is confirmed. We believe that
any responsive move by the Administration would only reward this kind of hostage-taking
strategy. At least as important, it would make us vulnerable to significant criticisms from the
Democratic base and all credible aging advocacy organizations, who strongly oppose the Kyl
amendment. Opponents of the amendment fear that this provision would open the door to a
two-tier Medicare program which would both reduce access to needed care by allowing
physicians to pick and choose patients and create major fraud opportunities for physicians who
contracted out beneficiaries but still bill Medicare for their services.

Vice President's Participation at NIH Ground Breaking. Next Tuesday the Vice President
will join Dr. Varmus, Donna Shalala, Senator Mark Hatfield (R-OR), and many others in
dedicating a new building for clinical research on the campus of NIH that will be named for the
Senator--a longstanding advocate of NIH during his years as Senate Appropriations Chair. We
are currently working with NIH and HHS to determine whether there is any modest
announcement that the Vice President can make. We have, however, decided to delay any
announcement of the Medicare cancer clinical trials initiative that we have referenced to you
previously. Weare still getting final cost estimates and reviewing possible financing estimates
for this proposal. Moreover, if you decide to pursue the initiative, we think it might be
significant enough to announce at a Presidential event on the progress we are making on the war
against cancer. Parenthetically, since 80 percent of men with prostate cancer are over age of 65,
the NCI has indicated coverage of these trials will represent a major contribution in our
increasing commitment to diagnose, treat, and eventually cure this disease.

Kassebaum-Kennedy Implementation. We held an interagency meeting (HHS, Treasury,
Labor) to follow up on your concern about recent reports that insurance companies are giving
insurance agents incentives not to enroll high risk individuals. HHS informed us that while they
had no sure way of determining how widespread the problem was, state insurance commissioners
had informed them that the publicity surrounding the issue had clearly served to significantly
curtail these activities. Despite encouraging reports, we pushed HHS to determine if there are
actions that we can take to ensure nationwide compliance with the law. They reported that we
may be able to take administrative/regulatory action to address this issue by sending a notice to
all states that underscores our interpretation of the law and advises the states to enforce it
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

accordingly. This notice would strongly emphasize the Federal Government's commitment to
enforce the law if the states drop the ball, through the back-up authority the statute provides.
We told HHS we wanted to send out the notice no later than December (assuming they confirm
we have the authority to do so).

Medicaid and Tobacco. This past week, the White House reached an agreement with HHS and
the Justice Department on a letter to be sent to all states on these issue oftobacco settlements and
the Federal Government's claim to our part of the Medicaid dollars recaptured by the states.
The letter, which is scheduled to be sent on Monday, has been written in a generic,
non-threatening tone that, in essence, lays down the legal marker that the Justice Department and
HHS felt they needed. However, it also explicitly recognizes that upcoming national legislation
may well address the difficult Medicaid recoupment allocation issue. In preparation for the
letter's release, we met with Governor Chiles' office to advise them of the legal and political
bind we felt we were in with regard to this issue. Although his staff indicated that Governor
Chiles would probably prefer no letter, his Deputy Attorney General informed us that the type of
letter we are planning to send sounded quite reasonable. They all seemed pleased that it would
be a generic, low-profile letter. We will carefully and quietly roll out the release of this letter
and make sure that appropriate parties (NGA, APWA and the Hill) are notified.
