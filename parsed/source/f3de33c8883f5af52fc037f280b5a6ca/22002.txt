Attorneys Fees Relating to Tobacco Settlements

All attorneys fees have been negotiated outside of the amounts settled by the states. Therefore,
the attorneys fees already agreed to in MN, TX, FL, MS as well as any future fee awards will not
directly affect state settlement amounts. However, the settlements cap industry annual payments
at $500 million annually, which means lawyers awarded fees in the future may have to wait for
payments or have their settlement amortized over a number of years.

       Minnesota: When Minnesota settled in May, 1998 the State had a contingency agreement
       with the law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P for 25 percent of the
       settlement agreement. However, as part of the state settlement, the law firm released the
       State from the contingency contract and entered into a separate agreement with the
       tobacco industry for the payment of costs and attorneys fees. This was done so to
       separate the state settlement amount from the attorneys fees. The eventual consequence
       was that the legal team negotiated fees that were approximately 7 percent of the entire
       state settlement.

       Texas, Florida, and Mississippi: On December 11, the Tobacco Fee Arbitration panel
       awarded $8.2 billion in fees to attorneys representing Texas, Florida and Mississippi.
       The three-person panel awarded Florida's attorneys $3.43 billion; Texas lawyers $3.3
       billion; and $1.43 billion to Mississippi's attorneys. The tobacco industry will pay the
       legal fees in addition to the $206 billion they agreed to pay in the November, 1998
       settlement with 46 states. The awards will be paid out over 25 years, and the unpaid
       balance of the fees will be adjusted each year for inflation. However, because the state
       settlement agreements for the three states included provisions requiring legal fees be
       capped at a level eventually reached by a national settlement, the industry will payout no
       more than $500 million in legal fees annually, which also includes yet-undetermined fees
       in the 46 other states. The three states were effectively "forced" into arbitration after the
       states refused to honor contingency agreements made between the firms and the Attorney
       General's offices. In Florida, the state argued that the attorney general did not have the
       authority to enter into such a contract. In percentage terms, the awards exceeded what
       the Florida, Texas and Mississippi attorneys likely could have claimed under their state
       agreements.

       46 State Settlement: Since the majority of states "piggy-backed" their claims on the
       basis of Florida, Texas, and Mississippi's work, their claims are expected to be smaller
       and adjudicated quickly. The November omnibus state settlement spells out a two-tier
       system intended to effectuate quick settlement:

              1. Liquidated Fees -- Attorneys representing states could apply for
              reimbursement on a liquidated basis if they are able to settle with the industry.
              So far eight states (WA, VT, NV, MT, AL, AZ, OR, ID) have settled directly with
              industry for $220 million to be paid out over a short period. With an overall limit
              of $1.25 billion, liquidated fees are the likely course to be taken by the majority of
              the remaining states. Liquidated fees will allow the states to settle quickly and
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


avoid the annual limits for arbitration awards. Still, there is a $250 million
annual cap on liquidated fees and they will only be paid through 2003.

2. Arbitration -- For states unable to agree with industry on a liquidated
amount, arbitration is available. The three-person panel will be similar to the
structure that decided the Texas, Florida, and Mississippi cases. The members of
the arbitration panel will consist of a neutral party (agreed to by industry and
attorneys), an industry representative, and a representative of the respective state.
Arbitration decisions will probably be based of the same criteria used in the recent
cases -- a flat 10 percent of what the state was awarded in the agreement, plus a
"risk" or "difficulty"factor. However, because the remaining states provided
little support, their "risk" multiplier will be extremely low.

                                                                              Automated Records Management System
