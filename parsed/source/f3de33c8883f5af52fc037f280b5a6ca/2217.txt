                             TALKING POINTS ON RACEIRECONCILIATION
                                        AS OF MAY 9, 1997

          * In discussing this initiative, we have concluded that it is prudent not to make analogies
         juxtaposing the future of u.s. race relations with instances of civil war or major ethnic strife,
         e.g. Bosnia, Zaire or the Mid East. However, it is all right to talk affirmatively about the U.S.
         as a beacon and example to a world where there are deep divisions among ethnic, racial and
         religious groups within nations and among nations. A Q&A will be provided on this type of
         question which has surfaced repeatedly.

                    The charge the President set is for us to shape an initiative that will make a
                    difference for Americans --that will make changes and improvements that we
                    can look back on with pride. The President's goal is for us to enter the next
                    century as a strong and united America.

                    At a time when affirmative action and other tools to deal with discrimination
                    are under attack, we must establish a new American consensus about what it
                    means to be and become One America. While there is no immediate crisis
                    driving us, the President believes that we should take stock of the progress
                    we have made in race relations and take action to improve the ability of all
                    Americans to succeed in the 21st century.

                    We face a very different America in the next century. After all, America has
                    changed a great deal in the past three decades. Hispanic-Americans are
                    now the fastest growing minority group. There are four school districts in
                    the country, including one right across the river from here --in
                    Virginia --that have children from more than 100 different racial and ethnic
                    groups in one single school district. We should embrace such diversity.

                    The President has long maintained that the evil of racism is rooted in our
                    separateness. He believes that greater dialogue between individuals of
                    differing races will reveal the similar interests and values all Americans
                    share. The President wants to encourage Americans to celebrate their
                    diversity while reinforcing the values important to us all.

                    The President has been a constant voice in pressing racial healing and
                    unity. Those occasions include speeches in Memphis, Tennessee in 1993 and
                    Austin, Texas in 1995, his inaugural and State of the Union addresses this
                    year, a recent radio address, and the Jackie Robinson anniversary
                    commemoration. He will address the issue of reconciliation again on
                    Friday (May 16) when he apologizes, on behalf of the U.S. Government, for
                    the Syphillis Study at Tuskegee University.         The President's first
                   'commencement speech this year will be at an historically Black school --
                    Morgan State University in Maryland. This national address on Sunday,
                    May 18th will focus on science and technology.

            The President's experiences with discrimination are rooted in the South and
            in the legacy slavery left. His grandfather had a grade school education and
            ran a grocery store in Hope, Arkansas. Most of his customers were black,
            poor and were working people. As a child in that store, President Clinton
            learned that people of different races could and should treat each other with
            respect and dignity. While his grandparents were in the minority being
            poor, Southern whites who were pro-civil rights, they taught the President a
            lesson that he has carried with him through life -- Discrimination is not just
            morally wrong, it hurts everyone.

        ·   The President has been consistent and steadfast throughout his life and
            professional career in his pursuit of equality and opportunity for all.

            We are crafting an initiative that capitalizes on the power of the Presidency
            and the strengths of this President. The bully pulpit is a potent amplifier of
            any Presidential message.         President Clinton's personal history and
            conviction to lead this country in finding strength in our diversity make him
            well suited to help forge alliances and reconcile differences among us.

        ·   The President has not yet settled on the set of activities that will constitute
            this initiative. We are designing a proposal that strikes the right balance
            between study and action.

TEXT:
Elena:

Here's a quick update on today's reconciliation meeting:

1. We are moving forward with the previously suggested 3-part initiative
that includes: (1) a 7-member commission with one change by POTUS; he
wants to include former White House Fellow and DPC member Susan
Johnson-Cook (African-American minister); (2) 4 town halls; and (3) 1
meeting/event each month for the next year.

2.  Sylvia, Cheryl Mill and Jodie Torkelson will meet before the next
meeting to iron out legal, budget and staffing issues. You are on the
hook with Counsel's office for one unresolved issue: whether or not we
need an EO/directive.  Sylvia suggested that Counsel's office (Diane?)
contact you on this, and that the two of you come forward with options and
a rec by next week's meeting.

3. DPC should begin thinking about a policy pieces to incorporate into
the "initiative" over the next year.  She expressed that while we
generally do 80% policy to 20% dialogue/communications, that' this
initiative should be the opposite -- 80% dialogue/communications and 20%
policy.

4. Other miscellany: (1) memo on outreach to Rev. Jackson and the chair
of the Commission on Civil Rights will be drafted by end of week; and (2)
draft press plan to be circulated this week for comment.

Next week's discussion will focus on "scope of the commission's mission"
and "how to measure success."

Hope this helps,
Jose'
