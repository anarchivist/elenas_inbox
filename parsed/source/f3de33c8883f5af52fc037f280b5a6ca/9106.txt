TEXT:
Jose' tells me that he spoke to Chris Edley, and Chris had asked him to
meet with Scott. We sat down with Scott on Friday for a couple of hours
to discuss his initial outline/thinking paper on the key substantive
issues and goals of the workplan on criminal justice.  We spent the bulk
of our time talking about some of the "challenges" as identified in
Scott's outline (i.e., disparities in criminal offending, racial
profiling, sentencing).  However, we were in agreement that the starting
point and the focus of our undertaking should be on the disparities in
criminal victimization, and the public safety needs of minority
communities. Scott agreed to revise his outline/thinking paper to reflect
our suggestions.

Next steps: Scott promised to get us a revised outline sometime this week,
which I will fax to Jose.  I am working to set up a meeting for next week
with DPC, PIR, OMB, DOJ, and Treasury to begin a broader discussion of the
issues raised.  I believe we will follow up with a meeting the week after
that as well.
