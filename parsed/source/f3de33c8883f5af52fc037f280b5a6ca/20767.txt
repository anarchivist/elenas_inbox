TEXT:
The data CEA put in its weekly report are based on the NGA Fiscal Survey
of States which we've circulated around (published in May). I'll fax you
copies of the item.  The President wrote "good" next to the sentence
saying "While the Nation's welfare caseload fell by more than a quarter
between 1996 and 1998, overall state spending on welfare decreased by less
than 10 percent, and state spending on child care and job readiness
training rose sharply." He cc'd the First Lady on the item and flagged it
for Bruce yesterday.
