 Domestic Partner Benefits
 By Mike Causey
 washington Post Staff Writer
     The "domestic partners" of u.S. government workers -- regardless of sex
 or
 marital status -- would be eligible for health insurance coverage through
 the
 federal employee health program under a bill introduced by Rep. Barney
 Frank
 (D-Mass.). It also would make them eligible for lifetime survivor benefits
 under the federal pension program.
     Frank is one of the few openly gay members of Congress.
     His proposal has been endorsed by the American Federation of Government
 Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union and the American
 Federation
 of Government Employees.
     The federal health program -- the nation's biggest company-style plan --
 covers more than 10 million current and former federal workers, spouses and
 families. In some cases, ex-spouses can be covered (if they pay the full
 premium), as can dependent grandchildren. But unmarried couples aren't
 eligible for family coverage. Taxpayers pay about 72 percent of the total
 premium for insured workers and retirees.
     Frank said Uncle Sam trails "progressive" private firms that extend
 benefits to domestic partners. He said it is time for the government to
 "recognize that people who live in committed relationships, regardless of
 their sexual orientation or marital status, ought to be eligible for the
 same
 basic set of benefits, including health care coverage, life insurance,
 health
 insurance and compensation for work injuries." Under the Frank bill, the
 extended health and retirement coverage would go to:


       Same- or opposite-sex couples (if one of them worked for the government
    or
    Postal Service) who are "living together, in a committed, intimate
    relationship."
       Couples who are responsible for each other's welfare and financial
    obligations.
       Those domestic partners would get the same health and life insurance
    benefits and retiree survivor benefits as the spouse of a federal employee
    or
    retiree.
       To be eligible, couples would have to submit an affidavit of eligibility
    for benefits to the Office of Personnel Management. It would certify, under
    oath, that the couple were in a committed domestic relationship and were
    living together.
       Fourteen other House members (all Democrats), including Del. Eleanor
    Holmes Norton (D.C.), are co-sponsoring the bill.
