TEXT:
Barbara Chow is holding a teleconference call with ED in her office at
11am this morning to try and close out remaining issues that OMB flagged
in the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Bilingual titles of ESEA. During
this call, they would also like to resolve the issues that DPC has raised
in those two titles i.e., tobacco-free schools act, expulsion under the
gun-free schools act, and operationalizing the three-year goal in the
bilingual ed grants. This meeting may also provide a quick opportunity to
explore any other changes we might want to pursue in the SDFS title --
given recent events.

OMB and ED are also planning to meet from 11-1 on Thursday, if necessary,
to close out remaining items.
