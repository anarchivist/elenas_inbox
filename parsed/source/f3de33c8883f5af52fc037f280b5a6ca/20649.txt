        OF LEGISLATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF H-lB VISAS


         The Administration supports sound and balanced legislative efforts to address shortages
of skilled workers within certain sectors of our economy. We believe that the most important
response for increasing the availability of skilled workers must be increasing the skills of U.S.
workers and ensuring that employers seek U.S. workers first. Thus, while it may be necessary in
the short-term to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers, this must only be
done in conjunction with additional efforts to increase the skill level of U.S. workers and
meaningful reforms to the H-lB program. We look forward to working with the Congress to
achieve a sound and balanced bill that both protects U.S. workers and respects the good faith
business judgements of employers.

        If the President is presented with a bill that increases the cap on H -1 B visas, but does not
contain a significant training component and meaningful reforms that require employers to
recruit U.S. workers before applying for an H-IB worker and to not lay-off a U.S. worker in
order to hire an H-IB worker, the President's senior advisors will recommend that he veto the
bill.
