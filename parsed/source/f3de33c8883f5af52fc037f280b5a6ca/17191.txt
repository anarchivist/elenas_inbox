                        PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                     REMARKS ON FOOD SAFETY REGULATIONS
                                 OVAL OFFICE
                               OCTOBER 2, 1997

       At the beginning of this century, our government made a fundamental promise to our
people: We committed ourselves to making sure that the world's most bountiful food supply
would always be the world's safest. And from the day I took office five years ago, I have
worked very hard not only to honor this promise and but to make our food supply even safer.

         We have put in place new rigorous safety standards for meat, poultry, and seafood
products, throwing out archaic and ineffective inspection methods that had been left untouched
for nearly a century. We have begun requiring slaughterhouses to test for deadly E. Coli and
salmonella bacteria before shipping their products to our stores. We have begun developing
new safety standards for fruit and vegetable juices. We have brought a host of federal agencies
together to boost food safety research, education, and food contamination surveillance efforts
across the country. And in doing so, we are using the world's best science to prevent
contamination tragedies before they happen, to make sure that our food supply is the safest it can
be.

        Today, our food supply remains the world's safest. But we know we cannot rest on our
accomplishments. We must do more. We must make sure that increased trade never
diminishes the safety of our food. Today, I want to tell you the new steps we are taking to
ensure that our fruits and vegetables .. including those imported from other countries .. meet the
highest health and safety standards.

        First, I am asking Congress to give our Food and Drug Administration the power to ban
the importation of fruits, vegetables and other foods from countries whose food safety
precautions do not meet American standards. This new law would be very similar to the
USDA's current policy of keeping meats and poultry from countries with unacceptable food
safety systems out of our stores. Also, in my next budget, I will provide extra funding to
strengthen the FDA's international food inspection force.

      With these efforts, we can make sure that no fruits and vegetables cross our
borders, enter our ports or reach our dinner tables without meeting the same, strict safety
standards as those grown in America. Our food safety system is the strongest in the
world. And that's how it's going to stay.

        I am also directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Department of
Agriculture to work together, in close cooperation with the agricultural community to develop
rigorous safety standards for growing, processing, shipping and selling fruits and vegetables.
The standards should address such as aspects as sanitation, worker health, water use, problems in
the distribution and marketing system, regional and crop variations.

       I am asking Secretaries Shalala and Glickman to report back to me within 90 days with a
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

complete schedule for developing these standards within a year, as well as a comprehensive plan
to improve the monitoring of food safety systems abroad, help foreign countries upgrade their
safety precautions, and toughen food inspections at the border.

        Being a parents is perhaps the toughest job in the world. Our parents deserve the peace
of mind that comes from knowing that the food they set before their children will nourish and
strengthen their bodies, not make them sick. With today's new actions, we will help make their
jobs that much easier.
