TEXT:
FYI, here's what OMB is carrying in legal immigrant benefit restorations.

1. Food Stamps -- $2.7 billion over 5 years
Restore benefits to:
all families with children
disabled/elderly population who got SSI/Medicaid benefits restored (i.e.,
here when law was signed)
Let refugees/asylees get benefits for 7 years after arrival.   (Current law
is 5 years; we extended it to 7 years for SSI/Medicaid, so this would
conform to that for food stamps.)

possible ways to scale this back are to:
drop the disabled/elderly (saves about $600 million)
drop non-working parents -- i.e., cover working parents only (also saves
about $600 million)

OMB is pushing to include non-working parents on the .theory that they're
the poorest. Also, if we cover kids but not parents, advocates will argue
that we're still hurting the kids, since the household eats together.

These restorations would cover both people here when the law was signed
and new entrants. The strategy is that we should let Congress propose
scaling it back.

There will probably be some action on this issue early on, when the "Ag
research" bill comes' up. This is the vehicle to spend the $1 billion+ in
cost allocation savings. The expectation is that this money will be
divided among crop/agriculture and legal immigrants, with perhaps $400
million in restorations potentially happening at that time.

2.  State Option to Cover Legal Immigrant Children under Medicaid and CHIP
   $200 million
This is small and politically popular.   It only applies to children
entering after the law was signed, since those who were here in 8/96 are
already covered.
