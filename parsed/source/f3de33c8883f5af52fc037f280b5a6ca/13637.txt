TEXT:
        As I understand it, the draft USDA memo is intended to
articulate our Administration policies guiding the
negotiations/search for replacment timber. My staff tells me it
is not supposed to go public or to be guidance for the field.
        However, we all know how private such documents are! So
my comments back have dealt with wording with the expectation
that it will become a public document (eg, the explicit wording
on using lesser standards instead of the "call home" approach).
