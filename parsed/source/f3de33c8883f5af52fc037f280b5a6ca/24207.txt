      paul,-   As I'm sure you know all to well, the President is calling MLK
      Day a day of national service and asking folks to do some kind of
      volunteer work.   I am organizing an activity for WH staff (see below) .
      Would you help me recruit by circulating the information to DPC?
      Thanks.
      Michele
