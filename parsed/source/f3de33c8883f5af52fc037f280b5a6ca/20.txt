TEXT:
Justice tells me the House judiciary has scheduled a markup of HR
497 (Wolf's gambling commission bill) for tomorrow.  They are
preparing a letter to send. The letter is expected to be very
similar to the memo they forwarded last month -- the do not object
to the study but do have problems with Sec. 5(b), which authorizes
the Commission to obtain information from any Federal agency.  DOJ
believes the authority is too broad and could jeopardize ongoing
investigations.
They are aware of the President's letter and have been told their
letter should cross reference that letter.
