FYI -
Pro-choice groups are worried about today's news that the Republican leadership
of House & Senate Foreign Ops agreed to support the Mexico City language --
which would prohibit the US from giving population funds to any foreign clinic
that mentions/counsels on abortion as an option -- even if the clinic does not
perform abortion.  It's the so-called international gag rule.
Nancy Ann Min is on top of it. We're telling the groups that it's still being
worked on.
