Okay, okay. Let me eat crow for my aborted attempt to stay off email.
But it WAS getting to be a bit of a time-sucker, and I'm not going to let
it get out of hand.  But still, it is useful for tasks like this:

To follow up on our meeting of Tuesday on issues and ideas we want to
highlight during the President's trip to Africa, here are some topics.  We
need to assign them to dates -- a mission that should include coordination
with the Hill.     I think Michelle is going to try to pull us back
together for a follow-up meeting on Friday.
