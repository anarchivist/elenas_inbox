TEXT:
You asked me to call Sean D back.   Here is the concern:

USTR says that we may be enforcing a "system" against foreign countries
(point 2 of the memo) while we only have suggested "guidelines" for
domestic enforcement.     This would make it GATT illegal, a different
national treatment issue.

He says it won't be a problem if we give FDA leeway or "discretion" to not
close a foreign company down even if there is no foreign guideline
compliance.
