Subject:         TANF Rule Consultations

FYI -- We've agreed to meet with several groups that want to share their
views on the TANF rule.  These are simply listening sessions, and I do not
think you should come but I wanted you to know they were happening:

           Friday -- NGA, APHSA, NCSL, and NaCo staff
           Monday -- Center on Budget and CLASP staff
           Tuesday -- Dick Nathan
