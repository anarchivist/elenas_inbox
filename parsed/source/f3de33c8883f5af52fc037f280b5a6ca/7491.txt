TEXT:
I understand that there has been no decision about this week's radio
address topic, but that child care remains a contender.

If child care prevails (as we hope it does), here is what we envision:
the message would be Mother's Day, with the President s'tressing that today
mothers are more pressed than ever, working outside the home in greater
numbers than ever, and struggling to balance their responsibilities to
their jobs and their families.  He would talk about the need for
Congressional action on child care, harken to the 'Casey Foundation's
report which came out this week stressing the urgency of child care needs,
and make two announcements aimed at giving mothers greater peace of mind
about child care:  (I) the release of Department of Justice guidelines for
screening child care workers and other caregivers -- designed to reduce
the incidence of abuse by care providers; and (2) the release of two HHS
items: a report documenting model consumer education efforts and
underscoring the critical importance of getting good information to
parents on child care, and a check list for parents of questions to ask
and things to look for in finding high quality child care.
