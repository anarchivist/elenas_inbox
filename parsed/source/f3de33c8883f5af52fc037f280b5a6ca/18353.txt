TEXT:
I understand from Mike that he prepared a draft proposal for a WH
Conference on education and perhaps some other meetings with specific
constituencies to include mayors for you to review recently. When do you
suppose it will be ready for circulation for comment by IGA and others? I
am hopeful that we may be in a position to announce at least the mayor
segment when the President meets with the USCM winter meeting attendees
for breakfast in the WH on January 30. Thanks.
