 Congressional Record, January 19, 1999

 AMERICA AT A MORAL CROSSROADS
 FREEDOM OF ·SPEECH ACT

      Mr. HELMS.  Mr. President, I am also pleased to introduce the Freedom
 of Speech Act, which makes sure that federal employees are not forced to
 check their moral beliefs at the door when they arrive at the federal
 workplace.

      This bill attempts to make sure that President Clinton is not allowed
 to do by Executive Order what Congress has declined to enact in the past
 two Congressional sessions 0) namely, to treat homosexuals as a special
 class protected under various titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
 Last year, President Clinton signed such an Executive Order, and in so
 doing, infringed upon the Constitutional rights of Federal employees who
 wish to express their moral and spiritual objections to the homosexual
 lifestyle.

       President Clinton has instructed Federal agencies and departments to
 implement a policy that treats homosexuals as a special class protected
 under various titles of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This necessarily
 prevents federal employees who have strong religious or moral objections
 to homosexuality from expressing those beliefs without running afoul of
 what amounts to a workplace speech code. Apparently, when the President's
 desire to write his belief system into federal workplace regulations
 conflicted with the First Amendment right to free speech, the Constitution
 lost.

      Congress should jealously protect its Constitutional prerogative to
 make laws, and prevent the executive branch from creating special
 protections for homosexuals, particularly in a way that doesn't take into
 account the Constitutional right of freedom of speech enjoyed by all
 Federal employees. That is the purpose of the legislation I offer today.

      Under this bill, no Federal funds could be used to enforce President


Clinton's Executive Order #13807.  Further, no Federal department or
agency would be able to implement or enforce any policy creating a special
class of individuals in Federal employment discrimination law. This bill
will also prevent the Federal government from trampling the First
Amendment rights of Federal employees to express their moral and spiritual
values in the workplace.

     Mr. President, for many years the homosexual community has engaged in
a well-organized, concerted campaign to force Americans to accept, and
even legitimize, an immoral lifestyle. This bill is designed to prevent
President Clinton from advancing the homosexual agenda at the expense of
both the proper legislative role and the free speech rights of Federal
workers.   ***** S. 4S
     Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
united States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the 'Freedom of Speech Act'.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION.

     (a) In General: No agency, officer, or employee of the executive
branch of the Federal Government shall issue, implement, or enforce any
policy establishing an additional class of individuals that is protected
against discrimination in Federal employment, other than a class of
individuals specifically identified in a provision of Federal statutory
law that prohibits employment discrimination against the class, including
0)
      (1) title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et
seq.) ;
      (2) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621
et seq.); and
      (3) title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791 et seq.)
or title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111
et seq.).
      (b) Prohibition on Use of Federal Funds: No agency, officer, or
employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government shall use
Federal funds to issue, implement, or enforce a policy described in
subsection
      (a), including implementing and enforcing Executive Order 13087,
including any amendment made by such order.
