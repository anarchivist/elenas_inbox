TEXT:
No, no letter went up.  We sent a letter on the whole bill (Labor,
HHS, Commerce etc) that did not talk about ANY language (abortion
etc) except to say that in the case of the Senate it was somewhat
better but still had bad stuff and in the case of the House that
it was terrible AND AFTER BEATING UP OMB, I GOT THEM TO ADD THAT
THE TONGASS STUFF IN PARTICULAR, WHILE MODIFIED, WAS STILL
TERRIBLE.
On the issue of the Murray bill vs. the rest of the riders, I have
to say that there is about a 1-2% chance of the original Murray
bill (if adopted by the Senate) making it through the House.   So
I don't think that we will have the luxury of that choice:   If we
do, I am confident that we will still stand firm for the big
things in Interior.
On the Hatfield language, I think maybe we should have a memo from
you or Elena giving the layman's version of the disparity between
what he said and what the committee said done for LEP/POTUS.
Let's talk about this.  The final report is available, so we can
get that.  I would be curious if Murray's people know what the
report says. She is on approps of course.
