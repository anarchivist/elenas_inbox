I spoke to Ron and he wanted me to relay to you that we would like the
President (if he speaks about it tomorrow) and you and Secretary Shalala
to mention something like, "as part of the WH review of the tobacco
settlement, the Vice President will maintain an important, visible and
central role in the review process."

In the coming weeks we can work with the DPC to identify an appropriate
role for the Vice President.

Ron said he would mention this to you again in the morning.   Thanks.
