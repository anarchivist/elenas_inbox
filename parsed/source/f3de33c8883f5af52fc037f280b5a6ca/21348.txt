TEXT:
I believe this captures where we are at present:

Education Event Next Week: We are working with Sen. DaschleO,s and Rep.
GephardtD,s offices to plan an education event next week, that will
showcase Democratic unity around your education agenda and challenge the
Republicans to (bring your agenda up for a vote before Congress leaves) or
  (ensure that the final appropriations bill meets your overall funding
request for education and specifically includes funding for class size
reduction) or (ensure that the final appropriations bill meets your
overall funding request for education and specifically includes funding
for class size reduction, and school construction).
