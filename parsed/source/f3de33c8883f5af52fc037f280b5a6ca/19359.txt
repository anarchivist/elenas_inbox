Elena,
At the meeting with CIR last week, we informed them that we would send
each of the former Commissioners a copy of the proposal packet. Do you
want to include a cover note from you? I am attaching a draft that Steve
Mertens and I have put together.  Please let me know if this is something
that you would like to do and whether this looks o.k.   Thanks.

Julie

 Dear X,

       Enclosed please find the Administration's proposal for reforming the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) that was presented to House Appropriations Subcommittee
Chairman Harold Rogers on March 31, 1998.

         As our transmittal letter to Chairman Rogers notes, we believe that the Commission on
Immigration Reform correctly diagnosed many of the longstanding problems that have hampered
INS's ability to pursue the effective enforcement of our immigration laws and the efficient
provision of immigration and citizenship services. Guided by many of the Commission's
principles for reform, the Administration's restructuring plan will make federal immigration
activities more effective by separating enforcement and service operations within INS -- from
headquarters to the field -- while preserving the necessary integrating functions for supporting
and coordinating both operations.

       We understand that much remains to be done to implement this reform, and we hope to
continue this dialogue with you and Members of Congress as we move forward.


Sincerely,



Elena Kagan
Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
