        PRESIDENT CLINTON: EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR ALL CHILDREN
                                 May 19, 1999

     Today, the President announced that he will transmit to Congress this week the
     "Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999", his proposal to reauthorize the
     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. This legislation authorizes the Federal
     government's single largest investment in elementary and secondary education and is its
     most significant effort to ensure that all children receive a quality education. This
     proposal will provide strengthened accountability measures, ensure teacher quality,
     provide safe, disciplined and drug-free schools as well as reauthorize programs such as
     Title I (aid to disadvantaged students), bilingual education, magnet schools, and programs
     that support technology in schools.

     ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESULTS. The President's ESEA proposal incorporates a
     package of accountability measures that he announced in his State of the Union Address
     and that are designed to ensure that school districts and states provide students with a high
     quality education by holding students, teachers and schools to high standards. Our
     emphasis on accountability in ESEA will build on, support, and encourage State and local
     efforts to develop and implement challenging standards for all children by requiring states
     to fix failing schools, issue report cards to parents on how schools are doing, and end the
     practice of social promotion by ensuring that students are meeting challenging standards
     on-time.

     Identify and Turn Around Failing Schools.         The President's proposal will require states
     and school districts to publicly identify the lowest-performing schools and intervene to turn
     them around. These interventions would include steps such as intensive teacher training,
     extended learning opportunities and the implementation of proven approaches to school
     reform. If there is no satisfactory improvement in student performance within two years,
     districts would be required to take corrective actions, such as permitting students to attend
     other public schools; reconstituting the school and making significant staff changes; or
     closing the school entirely and reopening it as a charter school. Nineteen states currently
     take similar actions to turn around low-performing schools, and experience demonstrates
     that when these interventions are carefully implemented and accompanied by the necessary
     resources, schools do improve and student achievement increases.

     Issue Report Cards to Empower Parents. The President's proposal will require states and
     school districts to distribute to all parents annual report cards for each school and school
     districts, as well as for the state as a whole. These report cards will include information on
     student achievement, teacher qualifications, class size, school safety, and attendance and
     graduation rates. Where appropriate, the report cards will show academic achievement·
     by demographic groups, to help focus on the need to close the achievement gap between
     disadvantaged students and their peers. Thirty-six states currently publish· or require
     local school districts to publish school report cards, and five additional states will begin the
     practice in the next two years; A recent report by Public Agenda, however, shows that
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

only 31 percent of parents had seen these report cards. The President's proposal will help
ensure that all parents have access to the information they need to evaluate the quality of
their schools and identify the areas in which improvement is needed.

End Social Promotion and Help All Students Meet Challenging Standards.                   The
President's proposal will require states and school districts to end social promotion --the
practice of promoting students from grade to grade regardless of whether they have
mastered the appropriate material and are academically prepared to do the work at the
next level. Students will have to demonstrate that they meet standards at three key
transition points, including graduation from high school. Students who are promoted
without regard to their achievement fall even further behind their classmates, and are more
likely to lack basic skills upon graduating from high school. Studies also show that students
who are simply retained in grade with no additional intervention are at greater risk of
dropping out.

Supporting Students Who Need Extra Help. To ensure that this requirement helps more
students succeed and meet standards on-time, the President's proposal would hold states
and school districts accountable for supporting students who need additional help to meet
academic standards by: (1) requiring early identification and intervention for students who
need extra help; (2) strengthening learning opportunities in the classroom; (3) creating
smaller classes with well-prepared teachers; (4) encouraging high-quality professional
development for teachers; and (5) providing extended learning time for students who need
extra help, including after-school and summer school programs.

Smaller Classes. The President's proposal will authorize continuation of his Class-Size
Reduction initiative-- which seeks to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size to a
nationwide average of 18 in the early grades -- to give all students the individual attention
they need to master the basics and meet challenging standards on time. Over seven years,
this initiative would provide a total of $12.6 billion to help communities across the nation
support 100,000 well-prepared teachers. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers provide
more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result students learn
more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills.

Extended Learning Time: After-School and Summer School Programs. Giving children
more time to learn in enriching after-school, weekend and summer school programs can be
an effective tool in helping all students meet high academic standards and ending both
social promotion and retention.            The President's proposal will continue his
administration's strong commitment to the 21st Century Community Learning Centers
program which provides grants to public schools to offer additional learning opportunities
for students and community members. In Chicago, which three years ago ended the practice
of social promotion in a way that gives students who need it substantial extended learning time,
citywide math and reading scores have gone up every year, with the largest gains among the
most disadvantaged students.

ENSURING TEACHER QUALITY. According to the National Commission on Teaching
                                                                           Hex·Dump Conversion

and America's Future, one of the most important factors in improving student achievement
is the knowledge and skills teachers bring to the classroom. Yet every year, approximately
50,000 individuals teach on "emergency" certificates, which means they do not meet the
standards the state has set for certification. In addition, numerous teachers teach subjects
for which they lack adequate preparation, with fully one quarter of secondary school
teachers lacking even a minor in their main teaching field. Students in schools with the
highest concentrations of poverty --those who often need the most help from the best
teachers --are most likely to be in classrooms with teachers who are not fully qualified: for
example, in schools with the highest minority enrollment, students have a less than SO
percent chance of having a math or science teacher with a license and degree in the field.

Strengthen State Teacher Certification. The President's proposal will require states to
adopt performance examinations for all new teachers, requiring them to demonstrate both
subject-matter knowledge and teaching expertise. The proposal also will require states
and school districts to phase out, over four years, the use of teachers with emergency
certificates and the practice of assigning teachers to subjects for which they lack adequate
preparation. States would have to ensure that within four years, at least 95% of their
teachers are fully certified through regular or alternative routes, are in a program that
leads to full certification within three years or are fully certified in another state and
working toward meeting any State-specific requirements. To support these new teacher
quality standards, the proposal will provide resources to help states strengthen teacher
certification standards, test new teachers, provide training to current teachers, and offer
incentives to recruit more highly qualified teachers.

Training to Help Teachers Teach to High Standards. The President's proposal would
help schools and school districts give current teachers the tools and training they need to
help students reach high standards by supporting states and local efforts to provide
sustained and intensive training to teachers, mentor new teachers during their first three
years in the classroom, help teachers and principals align instruction with State academic
standards and ensure that all teachers are proficient in content knowledge and teaching
ski"lIs. This proposal would also help teachers, particularly in high-poverty districts, use
technology to teach students to challenging State standards, for instance by using distance
learning to get challenging subject matter into all classrooms.

Expand Recruitment and Retention Efforts. To help meet the need for 2.2 million new
teachers over the next decade, the President's proposal would support state and local
efforts to recruit and retain high-quality teachers in high-need areas, including a national
job bank and effort to increase portability of teaching licenses and pensions. His proposal
would also preserve and build on the successful Troops to Teachers program, which has
helped 3,000 retiring military personnel become teachers in public schools since 1994. This
expanded initiative - Transition to Teaching . would provide scholarships and other support to
help retiring military and other non-military mid·career professionals to become teachers,
particularly in high-poverty schools and in high-need subject areas like math, science, or special
education.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Certification for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools. In order to help ensure that students in the
most need are being taught by qualified teachers, the President's proposal would require all new
teachers in programs supported with Title I funds to be fully certified in the subject that they
teach. And, within two years, teacher aides in Title I schools with less than two years of college
would be limited to non-instructional duties, while those with two years or more of college could
provide instructional support and tutoring only under the supervision of a certified teacher.

SAFE, DISCIPLINED AND DRUG-FREE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. President
Clinton has challenged states, communities, and schools to take a number of steps to
restore order and safety, such as adopting school uniforms, enforcing truancy laws, and
imposing curfews. This proposal would take additional steps to help ensure that each
school is a safe, healthy, disciplined, and drug-free learning environment that allows
teachers to teach and students to learn.
Adopt and enforce, clear and fair discipline policies. In many schools, the breakdown of
classroom discipline remains one of the biggest obstacles to learning and one of the greatest
concerns for teachers, students, and parents alike. The President's proposal will require
states and school districts to adopt fair and consistently-implemented discipline policies
that are developed with the participation of the school community. In the case of students
who are suspended or expelled from school, schools must provide appropriate supervision,
counseling, and educational services. To better inform parents, schools will be required to
provide information about school violence and drug use, as well as the number of guns
brought to school, in the annual report cards provided to parents.

Counseling for Students Bringing Guns to School. Under current law, schools are
generally required to expel any student who brings a gun or explosive device to school, as
well as to report that student to local law enforcement officials and juvenile justice
authorities. During the 1996-97 school year, this national policy of "zero tolerance" for
guns resulted in more than 6,000 students being expelled from school. The President's new
proposal requires an assessment of any student who brings a firearm to school to determine if the
student poses an imminent threat of harm to himself or others -- in which case the student must
receive appropriate treatment before returning to school.

Strengthened Safe, Disciplined and Drug-Free Schools Program.                  The Safe and
Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program represents the federal government's largest
effort to prevent youth drug use and school violence. At the White House Conference on
School Safety, the President proposed overhauling the program to provide more effective
prevention programs for the reduction of drugs and violence in schools, more
accountability for results, and better targeting to those schools that need the most
assistance.     Under the President's reauthorization proposal, school districts would be
expected to develop comprehensive plans that, among other things, use proven anti-drug and
violence prevention programs, collect and report relevant data, intervene with troubled youth,
and establish security procedures for schools. This proposal would also support programs that
educate students about the risks associated with guns; promote alternative schools and "second
chance" programs for students who constantly disrupt classes; and expand character education
programs that help instill common sense values in our children.

                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

     Emergency Response to Violence. The President's reauthorization proposal also contains
     his Project SERV initiative --developed with the help of the communities impacted by
     recent schools shootings --to provide immediate assistance as soon as a school-related
     violent or traumatic incident occurs, through: an Emergency Response Fund to help
     communities meet urgent and unplanned needs, such as additional security personnel,
     emergency mental health crisis counseling, and longer-term counseling to students, faculty,
     and their families; and Crisis response experts identified and funded by the Departments of
     Education, Justice, Health and Human Services, and FEMA, who can help local officials
     identify and respond to community needs. Officials from those federal agencies worked
     together to help schools impacted by last year's shootings. These agencies will continue to
     work together as part of Project SERV, and improve ongoing federal crisis response
     efforts.
