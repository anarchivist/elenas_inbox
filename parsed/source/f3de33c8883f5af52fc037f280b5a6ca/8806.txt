TEXT:
According to NEC, a decision was made to issue a veto threat on the
legislation.  Peter's plan is to issue a general veto letter (that is low
on specifics) and simultaneously issue a letter from Gene that outlines
what a good bill would look like. According to Peter, the House is
issuing a rule at 3pm that will allow this to go to the floor.  Though it
is still likely that this won't go to the floor until tomorrow, Peter
wants us to be prepared to issue both the SAP and the letter today.

NEC is drafting the Gene letter, which we can review.
