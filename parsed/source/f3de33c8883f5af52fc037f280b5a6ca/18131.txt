TEXT:
Thanks for your guidance.   I would like to send Bishop Fiorenza the
following letter:

Dear Bishop Fiorenza:

        Thank you for your recent letter regarding physician-assisted
suicide, and the Drug Enforcement Administration's recent ruling.  I have
relayed your concerns to the President's Domestic Policy Council, which
informs me that the issue is currently under review by the Department of
Justice, so any substantive comment by me or other White House personnel
would be inappropriate.

        But please know that your voice and the voices of others who share
your views is being heard. And on a personal level, please feel free to
continue to contact me if I can ever be of assistance in the future.

But if I may weigh in for a moment, I think it would be tragic and unwise
to allow Oregon or any state to prescribe lethal poison in the name of
medicine.  I suppose states have the right to amend their murder statutes
to permit it under certain circumstances, and the voters of Oregon are
clearly of a mind to do so. But that does not carry with it a
concommitant Federal obligation to facilitate the means.  I don't think
it's prudent to allow states to amend federal drug laws as they see fit.

I'd be happy to discuss if you're interested. But in any event, let me
know if the above language is going to cause any problems.
