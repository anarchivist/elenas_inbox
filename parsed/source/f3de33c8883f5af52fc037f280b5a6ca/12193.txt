TEXT:
As I mentioned in the staff meeting, the First Lady is doing a child care
event on Monday morning to push our child care initiative and make two
announcements: (I) release a new Consumer Product Safety Commission
checklist for parents and child care providers of "hidden hazards" to look
for in child care settings, based on a study done by the Commission; and
(2) announce new efforts by Lifetime Television to amplify parents' voices
on their child care struggles. The Commission leaked its report to USA
Today and reports that it may make the front page. Also, FYI, Senator
Dodd is likely to join HRC for the event.

On the legislative front, Janet Murguia reported that the House will not
vote on a motion to instruct the conference committee on child care.
Gephardt and others want to do Medicare.
