TEXT:
Unfortunately I had a meeting that I called with folks from the outside
yesterday and missed the scheduling meeting, but as I understand,. the
women's history radio address in contingent on a policy announcement.
Therefore, I'm assuming you and others are going to be thinking about what
might be appropriate.   I'd like to suggest that we amplify the civil
rights enforcement package.   I know the VP announced most if not all of it
during the MLK speech in Atlanta, but women especially benefit from this
and the general public only think of people of color when they think civil
rights.  This would allow us to put the picture of women on this issue.

Just an idea.    We really want this address because we want to invite the
Congresssional Women's Caucus as the audience. We need to do something
with them and POTUS for Women's History or they are really going to be
ticked. When we floated the radio address as an idea to them and their
staff, they thought it was great.  Anything you can do to help is most
appreciated.  thanks
