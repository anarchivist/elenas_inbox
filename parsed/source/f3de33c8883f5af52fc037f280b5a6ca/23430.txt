                                                                              DRAFT 3/31/99



                     STATEMENT IN EXPLANATION OF SUBTITLE G
                ALIEN LABOR CERTIFICATION USER FEES

        This subtitle would require the Secretary of Labor to impose a fee of$500 on employers
submitting applications for certification of aliens for permanent employment or for H-2B
temporary visas (i.e. visas for temporary employment in occupations other than agriculture,
logging, or registered nursing). A similar $500 fee was established for employers submitting
petitions for H-l B temporary visas (i.e. visas for employment in "specialty" occupations) last
year under the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act.

         For aliens to be eligible for permanent employment or H-2B temporary employment, the
Secretary must certify, pursuant to an application submitted by an employer, that there are not
sufficient workers available at the place the alien is to be employed and that the employment
would not adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly employed workers in the
U. S. Currently, the administrative costs of the Secretary of Labor in carrying out these labor
certification activities are funded from appropriations out of general revenues and employers are
not charged a fee for the processing of the application. However, since employers significantly
benefit from the admission of these workers, it is appropriate that they assist in paying for these
activities.

        This subtitle would provide that the Secretary of Labor is to charge a fee of $500 for
applications for permanent immigrants submitted on or after October 1, 1999. In addition,
employers who have filed an application prior to that date would be able to receive a review of
that application under the same procedures used to review the applications submitted on or after
October 1 if they pay a $500 fee. The Department of Labor is currently developing and will be
implementing a new, streamlined adjudicative process for certification of applications for
permanent workers, and this provision would offer employers with pending applications the
option of using the streamlined process. The Secretary would also be required to charge a $500
fee for applications for H-2B temporary nonimmigrant labor certifications submitted on or after
October 1,1999.

        The fees collected under this authority would be deposited as offsetting receipts into a
special account in the U.S. Treasury. These funds would be available to the Secretary to, first, .
pay the costs of administering the labor certification process, including enforcement activities.
Amounts in the account in excess of the amount needed in any fiscal year for administration
would be available to the Secretary to carry out projects to assist dislocated workers in
accordance with provisions of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). This additional use
of funds is appropriate as a means for providing American workers who have lost their jobs with
training and other assistance needed to obtai,n reemployment and for reducing the need for the


                                                 5
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

admission of additional aliens to fill these jobs.
        Specifically, this subtitle contains two sections. The first section provides for the
establishment of the fees.

        Subsection (a) applies to fees relating to applications for labor certification of permanent
immigrants. Paragraph (1) amends section 212(a)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
(INA) to provide that submission ofthe application and payment of the fee is a condition for
receiving certification. Paragraph (2) further amends this section of the INA by adding a new
clause requiring the Secretary of Labor to impose a fee of$500 on employers submitting
applications for permanent immigrants on or after October 1, 1999, and on employers who
submitted such applications prior to that date who request a review by the Secretary of Labor
using the same review procedures applicable to the later applications. This clause also
prohibits an employer from requiring or accepting payment of the fee by the alien who is the
beneficiary of the certification. The Secretary is authorized to impose a civil penalty of up to
$1000 and order return of the payment to the alien if the Secretary determines that an employer
has violated this prohibition. In addition, this clause provides that the fees are to be deposited
into a special account in the U.S. Treasury.

         Subsection (b) applies to H-2B nonimmigrant labor certification application fees. This
provision amends section 214(c) of the INA by adding a new paragraph. The paragraph provides
that the Secretary of Labor is to impose a fee of$500 on employers submitting an application for
certification ofH-2B nonimmigrant temporary employment on or after October 1, 1999. The
paragraph also contains the prohibition against employers requiring or accepting payment of the
fee from an alien who is a beneficiary of the certification and authorizes the Secretary to impose
a civil penalty of up to $1000 on an employer violating the prohibition. The paragraph further
provides that these fees are also to be deposited in the special account in the U.S. Treasury.

        The second section of this subtitle relates to the establishment of the special account and
the use of account funds. This section amends section 286 of the INA to add a new subsection.
This new subsection establishes a special account in the general fund of the U.S. Treasury to be
known as the Alien Labor Certification User Fee Account. All fees collected for the labor
certification of permanent immigrant and H-2B temporary nonimmigrants are to be deposited as
offsetting receipts into the account. This subsection further provides that the funds in the account
are to be used by the Secretary of Labor for the costs of administering the labor certifications. In
addition, amounts that the Secretary of Labor determines are in excess of the amount needed for
admi)1istration may be used to carry out activities for dislocated workers in accordance with
section 171 (d) of the WIA. Finally, this subsection provides that the fees in the account are to
remain available until expended for the authorized activities.
