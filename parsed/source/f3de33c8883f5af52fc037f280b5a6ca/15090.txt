TEXT:
Child care regulations and standards

The proposed welfare reform child care regulations will do two things
regarding standards:

1) Health and safety standards will apply to more federally funded child
care. As in current law, all child care supported by federal Child Care
and Development Block grant funds will have to meet state-set standards in
three areas (controlling infectious diseases, building safety, and
training). What's new is that welfare to work child care now must operate
under the CCDBG rules, meaning these health and safety standards now
apply. The welfare -law made the change, and the regulations reflect that
change. The National Governor's Association opposes this requirement.

2) The regulations will interpret "controlling infectious diseases" as
meaning that states must ensure that children whose care is subsidized
with these federal funds have been immunized.

GSA Child Care Centers

Currently, 60% of GSA centers are accredited by the National Association
for the Education of Young Children. GSA has a goal of achieving 100%
accreditation.
