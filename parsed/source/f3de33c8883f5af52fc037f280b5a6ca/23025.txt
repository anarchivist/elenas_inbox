TEXT:
You asked us to look into doing on a Passenger Bill of Rights.  It turns
out that Dorothy Robyn at NEC started a "crash" project with
Transportation on drafting legislation. Gene saw an article about it and
told Dorothy to get it done before some hearings on this issue on March
11. We will send you the paper describing what they came up with
tomorrow.
