TEXT:
concerns
 if we receive a bill that impedes research but has a grandfather clause
or someother type of softener, do we sign?   this would be a frist/bond
bill w/changes.  in a war of words, what is an embryo, we lose.   when is
an embryo an embryo (we lose).  i'm beginning to think, if there is no
middle ground and i don't think there is, we should consider a clean
fight.

i keep hearing from the hill that the repubs are trying to peel off the
research community. i f this is the case, we need to regroup.

rachel levinson will be back on friday.    can we regroup then?   elena,
what's a good time?
