TEXT:
Per my voice mail, here are some of the specific non-education questions
that we can probably anticipate from the West Virginia audience Thursday.
In addition to these, I'm sure we would want one on the abortion issue.

Staff Secretary has told Christa that they need the Q's and A's and other
briefing material between 6 and 7 tonight.

Please let us know how we should proceed on this.

Thanks.
