One more thought: Shouldn't we mention this in the radio address ... that
what we can't do is cut key state, local law enforcment (and federal law
enforcement) that help us take on gun crime ... especially programs like
COPS that give communities the direct and flexible resources they
need ... etc.

BR:

I just talked to Deich about circulating this to the cops.   I can't
believe it ... the R's walked right into the cops trap. Their budget says
repeatedly that they "assume planned reductions in the Violent Crime
Reduction Trust Fund." The only planned reduction is COPS falling from
$1.4 billion to $300 million. We won't get a better budget hit than this
on crime .

. .. though we're still trying to get our hands on Hatch's bill.

      CHAIRMAN DOMENICI'S BUDGET PLAN WOULD CUT SPENDING FOR
               ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE PROGRAMS


        Senate Budget Committee Chainnan Domenici's budget plan proposes $23.5 billion for
Administration of Justice Programs in FY 2000 -- 6 percent below the FY 1999 enacted (not
including emergency supplementals) and 12 percent below the President's FY 2000 budget
request.    The Chainnan's mark assumes elimination of the COPS program and cutting all
other spending below 1999 levels. If the appropriators choose instead to preserve the COPS
program and then reduce spending 6 percent across all programs:

       The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) would be cut $74 million from the FY 1999
       enacted level of $1.23 billion. This cut could result in a reduction of approximately
       577 DEA agents.

·      The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would be cut $111 million from the
       FY 1999 appropriated level of$1.855 billion in the enforcement account. This cut could
       result in a reduction of approximately 1,031 Border Patrol agents or a reduction of
       approximately 3,960 detention beds necessary to incarcerate criminal aliens and illegal
       border crossers.

·      The Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI) would be cut $178 million from the FY
       1999 appropriated level of$2.962 billion. This cut could result in a reduction of
       approximately 1,469 FBI agents.

·      The Federal Prisoner Detention program run by the U.S. Marshals Service would be cut
       by $26 million from the FY 1999 appropriated level of $425 million. This cut would
       result in a reduction of approximately 1,226 criminal detention beds in FY 1999.

In contrast, the President's Budget continues the COPS program through a $1.3 billion 21 st
Century Policing Initiative and expands overall spending for justice programs.
