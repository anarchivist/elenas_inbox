The memo below was signed on February 9 by Sylvia Mathews and Don
Arbuckle.

MEMORANDUM FOR JOHN PODESTA

THROUGH:                        Sylvia Mathews

FROM:                   Don Arbuckle

SUBJECT:                        SSA Substantial Gainful Activity Proposed
Regulation


        Later this week (Thursday or Friday), the Vice President is
planning to announce an increase in the Social Security Administration's
Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) guidelines.  SGA guidelines indicate
the amount a disabled individual can earn and still be eligible for
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Disability Insurance (DI) benefits.
SSA is planning to publish a proposed rule in time for the event, which
would raise the SGA level from $500 to $700 per month.

           The increased SGA level will be strongly favored by disability
groups.     We do not anticipate any opposition.

         There are several good reasons to increase the SGA level at this
time.  The SGA level has not been updated since 1990.   The proposed
increase will roughly account for the increase in wage growth since 1990.
The increase in SGA is a way to encourage work among people with
disabili ties.

        SSA estimates that this change will affect 42,000 people and will
cost $1.2 billion over five years (SSI, DI, Medicaid, and Medicare).  SSA
is planning for the change to take effect June 1, 1999. The increase has
been included in the President's Budget and will be paid for through
increasing the number of eligibility redeterminations of recipients and
through a change in the regulations.

        OMB has been working with the DPC and NEC on this issue.     Please
let us know if you have any questions or comments.
