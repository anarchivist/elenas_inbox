     The Honorable Trent Lott
     Majority Leader
     United States Senate
     Washington, DC 20510

     Dear Mr. Leader:

             I write to urge you to allow the Senate to complete its work on juvenile crime legislation
     this week, and to once again consider the Lautenberg amendment to require Brady background
     checks for all guns sold at gun shows. Although I recognize that there are many other important
     issues pending before the Senate, none is more timely or important than preventing youth
     violence.

             In the wake of the Littleton shooting, there is broad national consensus that we must all
     accept responsibility and take action to help prevent youth violence. We in government have a
     special responsibility to enact and enforce common sense legislation that will help keep guns out
     of the hands of criminals and children. So I was pleased last week when the Senate voted to ban
     the importation of large capacity ammunition magazines, as well as the juvenile possession of all
     assault rifles and large capacity clips. Passing these proposals was a step in the right direction.

             I remain deeply disappointed, however, that the Senate has failed to take meaningful
     action to prevent criminals from getting firearms at gun shows. The Senate-passed amendments
     on gun shows have not only failed to close the loophole in current law that allows criminals and
     young people to buy firearms at gun shows without so much as a Brady background check, they
     also will open up new loopholes in the law that will make it easier for criminals to get guns and
     more difficult for law enforcement to its job. Frankly, this language is simply unacceptable and
     should not stand. Instead, the Senate should reconsider Senator Lautenberg's amendment, with
     all members present, and close the gun show loophole once and for all.

             Over the past few years, we have made steady progress against crime by working
     together. Our efforts, and those carried out in communities across the nation, are showing
     impressive results. This weekend the FBI released preliminary data for 1998 showing that crime
     is down for the seventh year in a row, the longest period of decline since the 1950's. I hope that
     the Senate will build on this progress by working together to debate and pass a tough, balanced
     juvenile crime bill that includes comprehensive measures to combat and prevent crime and gun
     violence -- and keep crime coming down in the 21st Century.


                                   Sincerely,
,.       ...
