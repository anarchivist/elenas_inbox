TEXT:
Today's release of state-by-state NAEP scores is more evidence that
raising academic standards for all our children is beginning to payoff.
Almost a quarter of the participating states have shown real improvement
in reading, and some states that had scores well-below the national
average have made the greatest gains in the last four years.  While this
news is encouraging, much remains to be done to ensure that every child in
America is mastering the basics. That's why I urge the Senate to vote to
continue their bipartisan support to put 100,000 new, well-prepared
teachers in the classroom and also to enact my Education Accountability
Act.  This Act will keep education reform efforts moving forward by
ensuring that states and schools districts end social promotion, turn
around low-performing schools, provide parents with report cards on
schools, and implement effective discipline policies.   While this nation
is clearly headed in the right direction, we take these steps to pick up
the pace of our progress so that every child in America is prepared to
meet the challenges of the 21st century.
