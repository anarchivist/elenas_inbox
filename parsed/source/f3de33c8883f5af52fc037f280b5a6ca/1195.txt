TEXT:
FYI, she sent over two of her staff people yesterday to meet with me about
setting up an EOP plan to hire welfare recipients.  I talked to them about
what I think are the two best models (America Works as an intermediary and
the Marriot program as an on site program).  I gave them contacts at both
as well as the name of the woman running D.C. welfare reform efforts
andothers inthe area who will be helpful.

They are gearing up to be ready to hire someone quickly after the
directive is issued.
