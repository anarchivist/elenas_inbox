                                  Needle Exchange Q&As
                                      April 29, 1998


Q:   What is your position on the Solomon Amendment to prohibit any Federal funding
     for needle exchange programs?

A:   The Administration strongly opposes this legislation because it is unnecessary and
     unwarranted. We believe that this legislation serves only to further politicize this issue.
     As such, we believe that Congress should focus on those issues that immediately impact
     the health and well being ofthe nation: youth smoking, quality shortcomings, and
     Americans ages 55 to 65 that have been failed by the insurance market.


Q:   If you believe that needle exchange is an issue that should be decided at the local
     level why does the Secretary need any authority to authorize Federal funding?

A:   It has been the longstanding position of Congress to give the Secretary of Health and
     Human Services the authority for to determine the scientific and public health merits for a
     wide range of public health activities. We believe is unwarranted and unnecessary to take
     away the Secretary's authority and that this legislation is being pursued for purely
     political -- not policy -- reasons.


Q:   If the science concludes that needle exchange programs reduce the transmission of
     DIV and do not increase drug use, why aren't you releasing federal funds for needle
     exchange programs?

A:   We have always said that communities should make their own decisions on this issue,
     based on their own circumstances and using the best available scientific information.
     Releasing federal funding for needle exchange would have inappropriately shifted the
     focus away from communities -- where these decisions should be made -- to the national
     level. That could have severely undermined or threatened local programs that are
     currently in place, and hindered additional communities from deciding to put these
     programs into place. At the same time, such federal action could send an inappropriate
     message about the acceptability of drug use -- a message that is not sent when an
     individual community decides, on the basis of its unique circumstances, that a particular,
     carefully designed needle exchange program advances public health interests. For these
     reasons, the Administration concluded that it should simply give the scientific guidance
     that is necessary for communities to make their own decisions, rather than federalize the
     needle exchange issue.
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
Background:

              Congress gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the responsibility to
              make two determinations: whether the scientific research findings conclude that
              needle exchange programs reduce HIV transmission and whether they increase
              drug use. In 1997, the Secretary made a determination that needle exchange
              programs do reduce the transmission ofHIV. Last week, the Secretary held a
              meeting with her senior scientific advisors, including Nobel Laureate and head of
              the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Harold Varmus. These scientists agreed
              that
              the science-based standards have been met with regard to drug use as well.

Q:   Wasn't the decision not to federally fund needle exchange programs based on
     political considerations?

A:   The decision was based on a belief that communities should decide for themselves
     whether to adopt needle exchange programs, based on their own local circumstances and
     the best scientific evidence possible. We did fear that federalizing needle exchange
     would imperil such local decision making, by igniting a congressional battle on the
     subject. ,To that extent, the Administration's decision took into account political
     realities. But first and foremost, the decision resulted from a commitment to real,
     locally-based decision making on this subject.
