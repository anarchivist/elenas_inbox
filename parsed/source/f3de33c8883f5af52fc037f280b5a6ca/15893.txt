TEXT:
Charter Schools: The Pennsylvania legislature passed a charter school law
last week. We have not seen the final bill, but from what what we know
now, it appears to be generally consistent with the principals underlying
our charter schools program. Several press accounts suggest that one
factor featured in the debate over final passage is the fact that
Pennsylvania would become eligible for several million dollars in federal
charter schools funds.  The bill passed with bipartisan support; an
overwhelming majority of Republicans as well as a slim majority of
Democrats, including a number of minority legislators from Philadelphia.

The bill will be signed into law next week. We are checking to see if it
will be possible for you to mark the occassion by releasing a Charter
Schools Guide from the Education Department, and highlighting the
Department's newly created Charter Schools Web Site.
