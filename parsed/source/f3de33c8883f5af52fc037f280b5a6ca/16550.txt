TEXT:
The folks from the Rand Institute for Civil Justice who did the study on
punitive damages in financial injury cases have offered to corne brief
those who are interested on the Thursday or Friday after Labor Day.    This
same group could also talk about Auto Choice (on which they have done the
best quantitative research) if we warned them in advance.   Please let me
know if you have any interest in attending, and if so, whether either
Thursday or Friday would be better, and whether you're interested in
hearing about Choice.  If you DESPERATELY want to come, but can't do it
either day, let me know about that too, as we can probably work something
else out.

Ellen
