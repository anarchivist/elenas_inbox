TEXT:
Katie has asked that you look into a legal issue in the context of
Charles Hurwitz's Headwaters takings lawsuit. A couple weeks ago
DOJ prepared a litigation risk analysis (which is currently stayed
while we proceed with negotiations--Iast Friday Pacific Lumber
agreed not to salvage log for 2 weeks during the negotiations) .
Dawn has a copy.
The analysis points out that the success or failure of such a
lawsuit depends on what acreage area of Headwaters that a court
uses as its basis for determining the issue--is the total area the
195,000 acres owned by Pacific Lumber, or is it the 3,000 acre
Headwaters grove? If it's the latter, of course, then we stand a
huge chance of losing the case. However, on or about this past
January, Hurwitz incorporated the 3,000 acre Headwaters
grove--which, as I am told, should effectively undermine his case.
DOJ did not analyze this issue, and it's obviously a critical
piece. Hence, could you do a legal scrub on this particular
issue? Please let me know if you need another copy of the risk
analysis, or if you need additional information. Thanks so much.
