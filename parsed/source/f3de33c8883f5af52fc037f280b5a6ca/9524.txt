Subject: NEW PROCESS for Press Paper

The Press Office is making a slight change to the way we produce documents
for the press, and it affects you.  From now on, documents drafted by your
offices (and we certainly appreciate it) will be finalized by the OEOB
press team NOT the folks in lower press.   This means that you should
forward DRAFT versions as soon as possible and then FINAL versions to the
OEOB press person responsible for an event.   We don't expect you to
remember who; the contact person for each event will call you as our
deadline for paper approaches.   (Mostly frequently that person will be
Sarah Gegenheimer, Julie Goldberg or Roger Salazar.   From time to time it
will be Julianne Corbett, Estela Mendoza, Megan Moloney or Dag Vega,)

In addition, as Jennifer reminded those who attended Monday's Deputies
Meeting, we cannot continue to get paper the day of an event or at 10:00
the night before.  This just doesn't allow us time to finalize the
product, distribute it to the Press Secretary and Deputy Press Secretaries
for them to study, and have it ready to release to the media' prior to the
event. Anything 'you can to do ensure that we receive your products by
6:00 PM the day before an event is cruci~l and greatly appreciated,

Thanks for all of your help and consideration in this matter,
