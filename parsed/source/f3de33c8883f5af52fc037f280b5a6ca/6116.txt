 TEXT:
 I have additional information about the spending in Conrad's bill. Once
 again, Conrad's staff has asked that we keep a very close hold on this
 information. They anticipate that their bill will generate $15B-$18B/yr
 beginning in year 3 when the $1.50/pack increase is fully implemented.
 From that amount, they take $2.5B off the top -- $2B per year for 10 years
 to fund Sen. Ford's farmer's proposal; $300M for FDA; and $200M for the
 Indian Health Service (N. Dakota politics).

 The remaining $$ are divided as follows:

 1.      25% (which Conrad's staff estimated to be $3.5B/yr.) to fund the
 public health spending outlined in the attached note.
 2.      20-25% will go to the states for the states unrestricted use.
 3.      The remaining $$ will be divided among Medicare, NIH, and early
 child development, including child care.
 4.      There are no $$ for compensation because they are not planning
 to place limits on liability in their bill.

Subject: Conrad Tobacco Bill

I received Conrad's Public Health and Other Programs funding title from
HHS.  Conrad's staff has asked us to keep a very close hold on it.    It is
Title VI of the Conrad bill. The title spells out how funds from a
section 101(d) (2) (C) will be allocated and spent, but the draft provides
no clue on how much money will be in 101(d) (2) (C).  I will distribute it,
but in the meantime here is a summary:

The title proposes to divide the $$ into 12 buckets controlled by the
Secretary (I assume HHS) :

  1. 30% for smoking cessation to individuals and private, non-profit
entities;
  2. 25% for counter advertising;
  3. 15% to NIH for tobacco related biomedical research including
addiction research;
  4. 10% for "anti-tobacco" research, including prevention, cessation, and
social determents of smoking;
  5.   5% to states for school-based tobacco education programs;
  6.   5% to states for alcohol and illicit drug education for <18;
  7.   3% for assistance and compensation for those suffering from
tobacco-related illness;
  8.   2.5% to expand ASSIST and IMPACT;
  9.   1.76% for international tobacco control to WHO and foreign
countries;
10.   1% for college tobacco education programs targeting 18-24;
11.   1% for event sponsorship; and
12.   0.083% for the American Center on Global Health and Tobacco (a new
private, not-for-profit corporation) and
                    associated trust fund.
