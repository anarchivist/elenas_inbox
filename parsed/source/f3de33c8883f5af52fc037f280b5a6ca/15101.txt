 Tuesday, 3/25/97

 If I were the parent of a sexually active teenage girl, I would be scared
 to death and mad as hell at Health and Human Services secretary Donna
 Shalala.

 Why? Because her failure to lift the ban on federal funding of
 needle-exchange programs has caused thousands of young women (girls,
 really) to acquire HIV from older, injection-drug-using male partners.

 That's the underlying cause of the tremendous increase in HIV among girls
 13 to 20. Most of these, along with about half of the pediatric cases,
 can be linked to dirty needles and the cold feet of Donna Shalala.

 To many activists, these new HIV cases will be known as the Shalala
 Infections until Donna Do-Nothing lifts her ban on federal funding of
 needle exchange programs.

 Her failure to do so will stand, historically, as an act of genocidal
 neglect. Elizabeth Taylor, last summer at the International AIDS
 Conference in Vancouver, called the failure to fund needle exchange "a
 measured act of premeditated murder." Papers with as diverse an editorial
 viewpoint as The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune have in recent
 weeks strongly urged the Clinton administration to find the political guts


    to fund needle exchange.

    Secretary Shalala's record on this issue is pathetic, if not criminal.
    First she suppressed a pair of CDC reports urging the administration to
    lift the ban. Then she ignited an international firestorm of criticism
    from scientists more than a year ago, when she lied about findings from
    research on needle exchange. She falsely claimed there was "a controversy
    over research" and that "experts disagree" whether needle exchange reduces
    new infections or increases use of illegal drugs.   (In fact, there is
    unprecedented unanimity among .researchers and public health experts on
    these two points.)

    Then Shalala lied about whether she had the authority to lift the ban,
    when Congress has explicitly granted her authority to release designated
    federal funds once these two points of science had been clearly
    demonstrated.

    A few weeks ago, Shalala issued her long-postponed report to Congress
    finding that needle-exchange programs can be "effective"-yet still refused
    to lift the ban.

    Shalala's inner circle would have us believe that lifting the ban would
    result in Congress immediately overturning her action.  Even the alphabet
    soup of AIDS-involved groups, including the National Association of People
    With AIDS, AIDS Action Council, National Minority AIDS Council and the
    Human Rights Campaign have abdicated any leadership role on needle
    exchange, quietly downplaying the issue as "too controversial."  (The
    American Foundation for AIDS Research, specifically Mathilde Krim and Jane
    Silver, and local ACT UP chapters are the notable exceptions).

    Others disagree and claim congressional support for needle-exchange is far
    broader than assumed and only needs leadership from Shalala or the
    Infecter-in-Chief, Bill Clinton.

    Either way, Shalala's failure to provide federal funds for needle exchange
    programs betrays a grotesquely cruel lack of morality of which she ought
    be ashamed. That's the real controversy.

    Shalala granted former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders an OK to lift the
    ban, but then quickly rescinded it after the Republicans swept the 1994
    congressional elections. Elders recently commented about the difference
    between "commitment" and "concern" when it comes to AIDS. There is no
    compromise on commitment, she said, while concern leaves a lot of leeway.

    Secretary Shalala is perhaps concerned. But her commitment is clearly to
    her own cowardly protection of a President terrified of taking any action
    that could be misconstrued by the Right Wing as evidence he is soft on
    drugs-even if the price of that cowardice is the infection of tens of
    thousands. And there is also speculation that her interest in running for
    Governor of Wisconsin precludes exertion of potentially controversial
    leadership on needle exchange.

    But what about Shalala's subordinates? Her supporters? Where are they on
    needle exchange? Do they offer lip service, or have they strongly lobbied
    Secretary Shalala, in writing, to lift the ban? Are they willing to
    accept the responsibility that their silence today truly means death
    tomorrow for thousands? Every genocidal atrocity requires "good soldiers"
    willing to overlook the impact of their actions ... or their silence.

    Maybe it will be a class-action lawsuit, maybe a war crimes tribunal or


 perhaps the scrutiny of an electorate with a long memory. But someday HHS
 Undersecretary Phil Lee, Deputy Secretary Kevin Thurm, press secretary
 Victor Zonana, Special Assistant Sarah Kovner, Presidential AIDS Council
 Chair Scott Hitt, former AIDS policy directors Patsy Fleming and Kristine
 Gebbie, AIDS Policy Office staffer Jeff Levi, Shalala walker Tom Goodwin
 and golf buddy Hilary Rosen and others will be asked what did they do?
 What pressure did they exert?

 Did they really go to the mat on this issue with Shalala? Increasingly,
 those who went into the Clinton campaign "committed" to fight AIDS have
 since been coopted and can now only claim the mantle of "concern."

 For those who haven't spoken up, they ought do so immediately. And
 loudly. They can still save their honor-and a place in history-by acting
 now.  In the process, they can also save lives.
