TEXT:
Bruce, after you talked to Karen, somehow the word got out on the Hill
that we support this, rather than we don't oppose it.  My best guess is
Karen conveyed this to LA County last night, wittingly or unwittingly.
(Kay Casstevens talked to Haskins, but she didn't go over the "do not
oppose" line.)  Dennis Smith is mad, since he brokered the Senate's lesser
penalties with Feinstein.  He says he now wants to reopen other issues
that had been closed and says HHS needs to come up with a way to pay for
this.

I am putting together a conference call to clarify, since the difference
between these 2 positions may be important.   HHS is mad that the word
went out without them knowing we were changing positions, and they may be
calling around to complain on substance and process.. They may still try
to argue we should outright oppose this.
