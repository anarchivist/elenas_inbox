         RAISING STANDARDS AND STRENGTHENING ACCOUNTABILITY:
                   KEYS TO IMPROVING PUBLIC SCHOOLS
                          DRAFT--October 28, 1997

President Clinton visited Oscar Mayer Elementary School in Chicago, where he met with
parents, students and teachers to learn firsthand of Chicago's school reform efforts. The
President called for more cities and states to take advantage of research and experience on
effective school reform, and to work aggressively to tum around failing schools, as Chicago has
done.

  President Clinton Praises Chicago School Reforms. More than a decade ago, the Chicago
  school system was singled out for having the schools that were "the worst in America". Today,
 noting significant increases in test scores over the past two years, President Clinton said that
  Chicago is now a school system on the move. Since legislation placed the school system under
 the control of Mayor Daley, Chicago has installed a new management team that placed the school
  system on sound financial footing, invested in needed school renovations and repairs, and
. adopted tough discipline policies. The school system has raised academic standards and
  implemented new programs to help students reach them. The Chicago Public Schools have
  strengthened the curriculum, expanded participation in preschool programs and kindergarten,
 provided training to help parents succeed as their child's first teacher, and implemented
  after-school programs to expand learning time and provide extra help to students who need it.

A Model of Accountability: Ending Social Promotions and Intervening in Failing Schools.
President Clinton praised Chicago's tough accountability system, which holds both students and
educators accountable for learning.

Chicago has ended social promotions, requiring instead that students meet academic standards at
grades 3, 6, 8, and 9 before moving to the next grade level. Students who need it are given extra
help to meet the standards, through extended day programs that keep schools open longer each
day and provide tutoring, enrichment programs and other types of academic help. Students who
don't pass the tests at these key grade levels are required to attend summer school. Nearly half of
those who attend summer school go on to meet the standards and are promoted to the next grade.

Chicago also holds schools to tough accountability standards, and takes decisive action where
schools are failing. Schools with fewer than 15% of the students meeting national norms in
reading are placed on probation. These schools are reviewed by an external team, which helps
develop a corrective action plan that the school must follow. Schools on probation receive
additional assistance and their performance is closely monitored. lfthe test scores fail to
improve or if the school fails to implement the corrective action plan, the Chicago Public
Schools can take additional steps, including requiring the principal and teaching staff to
recompete for their positions, removing the principal, or, if necessary, closing the school.

Federal Support for States and Districts Working to Tum Around Failing Schools:
President Clinton challenged other cities and states to follow Chicago's lead by taking decisive
steps to tum around schools with persistently low performance. The President directed the U.S.
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Department of Education to produce and disseminate guidelines on effective approaches to
turning around failing schools, based on the experience of Chicago and other cities such as San
Francisco, New York and Philadelphia, states such as Maryland and Kentucky, as well as on
lessons from business and from education research. He also directed the Education Department
to develop a plan for helping local school districts use existing federal education programs and
resources, such as Title I, the Charter Schools Program, America Reads, and the 21st Century
Schools program, to effectively improve or close down failing schools, and to provide the
students from those schools with the extra help they need to catch up academically.
