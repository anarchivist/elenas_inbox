TEXT:
I'll call Don, but you should know that this was a letting the cat out of
the bag comment ... The Internet V-Chip proposal was conceived months ago,
and held for two reasons:

1.      Its feasibility raises real questions about the depth of our
need for the CDA, and so it didn't seem appropriate to suggest it while
CDA was being challenged.

2.      Announcing it when and if CDA is struck down would have been a
terrific response to that decision.
