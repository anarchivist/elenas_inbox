It's definitely too early to confirm anything, but here's the track we're
on for upcoming events.  You may know all of this, but just in case ...

Mammogram Event is looking good.
        DATE: March 27
        TIME:   Briefing 11:30 pm - 12:00 pm (Oval Dining Room)
                Event 12:00 pm - 12:30 pm (Oval Office)
        SITE:   Oval Office
        EVENT:POTUS makes statement
                Shalala Speaks
                Questions from Pool
        NO AUDIENCE

ANNOUNCEMENTS:   1) Medicare Legislation amended being sent to Hill
                         2) Medicaid Letter (Melissa Skolfield preparing) .
                         *3) Challenge to the Private Sector
                          4) NCI Public Information Campaign (still getting
specif ics) .
*NOTE: The Challenge is simply rhetorical, and we are exploring whether
their can be a directive to OPM to do this at the Federal level. We are
working on finding out what OPM currently does, b/c if we don't do what
we're challenging businesses to do we could be vulnerable.    The
questions then become whether or not we can direct OPM -- we'll keep you
posted.

(FYI: NCI Press Conference at 10:00am at NIH.  They have not put out a
release saying they are doing this, so we cannot release an advisory until
they do. )

California Schools Event -- looking even better. This will be a great
event.
        DATE: April 2
        TIME:     Briefing 2:05 pm - 2:30 pm
                 Event: 2:30 pm - 3:30 pm
        SITE:    The East Room
        PROGRAM:         VP Welcomes
                         Delaine Eastin, CA Superintendent (Delivers
endorsement)
                         CEO (VIA SATELLITE)
                         John Dorr, CEO (endorses, possibly commits to help)
                         POTUS
                         * Riley would be on stage but not speak.
        AUDIENCE:        150 people can be invited:
                         Nat'l Education Groups
                         Nat'l Business Groups


                        California Education Reps
                        Calfornia CEOs

L.A. OPTION:    There is still potential to do the L.A. endorsement at
this event, however, Ann Lewis and Mary Ellen didn't think we need it.
The reasons not to do it are that:
 1) the CEO peice is definitely the big news,
2) Maria Echaveste had raised the concern that we may need to do work to
make sure the minority and urban L.A. communities are receptive. She and
Mike are working on this, but it could be a better announcement if we
waited.
3) We may want to save this for when POTUS is in L.A. on July 24th     he's
doing Boxer fundraisers and it could be a good addition to the trip, and
4) it would keep the program shorter.

There are several good parts of the L.A. announcement that I'm sure Mike
and you have talked about including that UCLA has adopted 2,000 reading
tutors, they have a good teacher training initiative, and they have
already adopted standards (at least 6 months ago.)
