                                     Hate Crime Q&A
                                       April 5, 1999

Q:   What about the article in the Washington Post today about the Matthew Shepard
     trial?

A:   The Administration does not comment on pending trials. However, the Clinton
     Administration has taken a number of steps to combat hate crimes. In November 1997,
     the President held the first-ever White House Conference on Hate Crimes where he
     announced several initiatives to ensure effective law enforcement, including the creation
     of working groups in every U.S. Attorney's district in the country to improve
     coordination among local, state, and federal prosecutors; the addition of new FBI agents
     and prosecutors to work on enforcement of hate crimes laws; and the development of
     model curriculum for training law enforcement officers to deal with hate crimes. Since
     the conference, the Administration has issued publications such as "Preventing Youth
     Hate Crime: A Manual for Schools and Communities" and "Protecting Students from
     Harassment and Hate Crime." In his FY2000 budget, the President has requested
     approximately $34 million for hate crimes enforcement.
