TEXT:
This will come up at the next Erskine scheduling meeting.  Stephanie, Ann
Lewis, Doug, Craig, Maria, etc., all seemed to understand that it was
something the President would want to do, and they understand the
significance of doing it at least a week before the Welfare Bill
anniversary so that we preempt stories on where states are to date on
implementation.
