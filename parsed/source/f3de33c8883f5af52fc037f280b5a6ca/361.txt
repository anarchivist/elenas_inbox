    The attached email from Wendy Taylor of OIRA is somewhat alarming.
    I think we need further clarification from her on what this means,
    and I will cc you on my question to her.
    But we may need to call the draft a final for legal purposes.

    As you know, we have the TANF State Plan guidance here formally for emergency
    review under the Paperwork Reduction Act. All collections of information,
    whether voluntary or mandatory, must be cleared through this process in order
    to be made legal.  It is my understanding that the guidance is still in draft
    form and that final decisions have not yet been made as to what should be
    included in the guidance.   However, in order to comply with the requirements
    under the Act, and given the current status of the State plan SUbmissions, it
    is extremely important that we formally sign off on the document immediately.
    Also, the document should be in its final form.  Otherwise, the Department has
    to undertake a lengthy public comment process which takes a minimum of 3 months
    to complete.


  Can you please let me know as soon as possible the status of the discussions
  and timeframes for resolving any outstanding issues? Feel free to call me if
  you have any questions. Thanks.
