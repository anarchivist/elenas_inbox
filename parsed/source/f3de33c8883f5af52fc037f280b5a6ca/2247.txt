                                               May15,1997

Honoring our nation's police. Today, President Clinton will speak at the Peace Officers' Memorial, to
honor those who have fallen in the line of duty and to praise police officers who serve us every day.

A Strategy That Works:

    Lowest number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty in over 35 years. In
    1996, 116 federal, state and local law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty, a dramatic
    30% decline over 1995. This is the fewest police officer fatalities since 1959.

    Crime rates have dropped for five straight years. For five years before President Clinton took
    office, violent crime was increasing in America. The President's anti-crime strategy has helped
    reverse this trend -- and violent crime has now dropped four years in a row. According to both the
    National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund and the Concerns of Police Survivors, "The decline in
    violent crime across America appears to have resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of
    police officers killed in the line of duty during the past year ... "[National Law Enforcement Officers'
    Memorial Fund (NLEOMF) and Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS), Press Release, 12/31/96]

Putting 100,000 new community police on our streets. President Clinton promised to put 100,000
new community police officers on the street to protect our communities -- increasing our nation's police
force by nearly 20 percent. Since passage of the President's 1994 anti-crime bill, 64,000 of these .
officers have been funded. According to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, "the COPS
program initiated by President Clinton to put 100,000 new officers on the street is helping [reduce law
enforcement fatalities] -- more police to deter crime and back each other up."[NLEOMF and COPS, Press
Release, 12/31/96]

Protecting law enforcement from deadly assault weapons. Because criminals should never outgun
law enforcement officers, the President's 1994 anti -crime bill banned 19 of the deadliest cop-killing
assault weapons. The President banned guns like the Uzi, which are the weapons of choice for drug
dealers and gangs. The number of officers killed by an assault weapon dropped from lOin 1995 -- to
one on 1996.

Preventing criminals from buying handguns. In 1993, the President signed the Brady Bill. Since its
passage, the bill has prevented 186,000 stalkers, fugitives and felons from buying handguns.
And the number of police officers killed by firearms declined by nearly 25 percent -- from 71 in 1995 to
55 in 1996.

The Agenda Ahead: The President wants to build on this record of accomplishment by -

     Finishing the job of putting 100,000 community police officers on the street.

     Ending the use of cop-killer bullets. These armor pi~rcing bullets serve only to endanger
the men and women we ask to protect us every day.

     Targeting gangs with new prosecutors and tougher penalties.

     Requiring child safety locks on every gun.
