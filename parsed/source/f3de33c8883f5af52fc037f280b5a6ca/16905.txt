                     NATIONAL FUNDRAISING KICK-OFF CONFERENCE
                                 September 19-20, 1997


           Hello and greetings from the White House. I am pleased to have this chance to join you .
    as you gather for the American Cancer Society National Fundraising Kickoff Conference.

           I want to start by telling you how much I admire the work of the American Cancer
    Society. For almost ninety years, the Society has dedicated itself to helping families deal with
    the devastation cancer can bring, to educating the America people about what they can do to
    prevent cancer ... and to finding a cure.

           It is a goal we share. In the last four years, we have increased federal funding for critical
    cancer research by over $400 million; we have taken action to stop insurance companies from
    denying health care coverage to people with pre-existing conditions; and we have worked to
    speed the approval oflife-saving drugs. Today, millions of Americans are surviving after a
    diagnosis of cancer, and are leading hopeful, productive lives.

            But there is more that we can do to fight cancer -- and we can start by doing more to
    protect our children and all of our people from the dangers of tobacco. Last year, my
    administration launched a comprehensive plan that prohibits retailers from selling tobacco to
    minors, and requires clerks to check I.D.s before selling cigarettes to young people. The
    balanced budget I was proud to sign in July includes a 15-cents-a-pack cigarette tax that will help
    states provide health care for up to 5 million uninsured children, and help prevent many young
    people from smoking in the first place. Last month, we took action to ban smoking in federal
    buildings across America. Now we must pass sweeping legislation that focuses first and
    foremost on reducing smoking among young people.

             In the coming months and years, I look forward to working together with the American
    Cancer Society to continue our fight against cancer. Hillary joins me in expressing our gratitude
    to all the volunteers whose dedication is helping the American Cancer Society bring us closer to
    a cure. Thank you, and God bless you all.
