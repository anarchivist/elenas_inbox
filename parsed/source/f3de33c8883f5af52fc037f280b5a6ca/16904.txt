 TEXT:
 DOL wants to release guidance to states on the $3 billion formula grants
 -- first in interim form next week and then in final form the week after.
 Regulations would then be issued by the end of October, within 90 days of
 enactment as required.

 Barry White, Emil Parker and I are meeting Friday afternoon from 1:00 to
 4:00 with DOL, HHS, and HUD staff to discuss the draft materials we have
 received. After providing comments tomorrow afternoon, we will insist on
 seeing and approving a revised version of the draft interim guidance
 before it goes out to the states.

 There are several issues on which I would like your feedback.

 1) Allowable uses: The draft guidance provides the flexibility in use of
 funds we've pushed for all along.   It allows states and localities to
 define the allowable use terms, i.e. to define "subsidized job creation,"
 "work experience," "job retention service," "post employment services,"
 etc. The guidance does, however, does give some examples, saying that
 post employment services may include education and skills training (the
 person would combine these with work) and that job retention services
 could include transportation, substance abuse treatment, and child care
 (by statute, funds for job retention services can be used for such
 services only if "not overwise available.")  HHS wants to provide no "such
 as" examples at all, as was done in the TANF guidance, because they don't
 want this guidance to influence state TANF decisions.  I am comfortable
 with DOL's "such as" approach.

 2) Required match: States and localities must provide a $1 match for every
 $2 in federal funds.   They may not use other federal funds or state funds
 used to match other federal programs.  There are two issues here:
 a) DOL wants to allow states and locals to use in-kind resources as well
 as "hard cash" as a match.  This would make the match much easier to meet,
 but it would also make it less meaningful. My view, which is


    coincidentally shared by OMB and HHS, is that we should insist upon a
    "hard cash" match, as we do in TANF.   NEe and DOL have expressed concerns
    that such a tough match requirement will prevent all the funds from being
    drawn down.  I say we should introduce the interim guidance with the hard
    cash match rule and let the states try to persuade us to change it.
    b) The DOL guidance says states must put up all their match in the year
    they receive the federal grant, even though they have three years in which
    to spend the federal grant.   It might make sense to have states match the
    funds as they spend them. We need to clarify whether this is legally
    possible given the statutory language.




    In addition to weighing in ort these issues, I will ensure that all the
    documents include a proper focus on private sector employment as the goal
    of welfare reform and that they put this program in the proper context
