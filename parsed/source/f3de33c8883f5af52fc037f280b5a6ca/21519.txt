TEXT:
I was hoping I can convince you both to attend the reception the AFT and
NEA are hosting intheir building on 16th Street following the School
Safety Conference.  The reception is from 4:30 pm - 6:00 pm and we would
just want you to stop by for 20 minutes during that time. We have no
Cabinet participation and it is important that we have some senior White
House representation. What do you think?

Also, Kevin we were hoping Erksine would consider?   Can you let me know?
