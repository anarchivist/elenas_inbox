MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION

Subject: Turning Around Low-Performing Public Schools

        Since taking office in 1993, and with your strong leadership, my Administration has
pursued a comprehensive effort to strengthen public schools. We have worked to raise
academic standards, promote accountability, and provide greater competition and choice within
the public schools,. including support for a dramatic .increase in charter schools. Moreover, we
have worked to make the investments necessary to improve teaching and learning in classrooms
across America, through efforts to keep our schools safe and free of drugs; provide students who
need it extra help to master the basics; increase parental and community involvement; recruit,
prepare, and provide continuing training to teachers and reward excellence in teaching; and make
sure every school has access to and can effectively use 21 st Century technology.

         This strategy is starting to produce results. We know that all students can learn to high
standards, and that every school can succeed if it has clear instructional goals and high
expectations for all of its students, if it creates a safe, disciplined and orderly environment for
learning, helps parents be involved in their children's education, arid uses proven instructional
practices. All schools must be given the resources, the tools, and the flexibility to help every
student reach high standards.

        Yet no school improvement strategy can succeed without real accountability for results,
as measured by student achievement. Excellent schools and schools that show significant
improvement must be recognized and rewarded. At the same time, schools that demonstrate
persistently poor academic performance -- schools that fail to make adequate progress in
educating all students to high standards -- mustbe held accountable. No American child
deserves to get a second class education. Instead; local and state education officials must step in
and redesign failing schools, or close them down and reopen them with new, more effective
leadership and staff.

         A growing number of states and cities have begun to take these steps. In addition to
Chicago, cities such as San Francisco, Philad~lphia, and New"Y01:k, and states such as Maryland
and Kentucky identify low performing schools and take steps to intervene if these schools fail to
make progress. These steps often include the implementation of school improvement plans --
providing after-school academic help to students, strengthening training and assistance for school
staff, creating smaller and more personal settings, such as schools-within-schools -- and, where
necessary, reconstitution of the school and replacement of the school principal and other staff.

       We must encourage and help more cities and states take up the challenge oftuming
around low performing schools and helping the students they serve get back on the path to
achievement. We can do this by making widely available information on what works and what
doesn't, and by ensuring that Department of Education resources are most productively used for
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
these purposes.

       In order to accomplish this, I am directing the Department of Education totake the
       following actions within 90 days:

       1. Produce and widely disseminate guidelines on effective approaches to turning
       around low performing schools. There is much of value to be shared from the
       experiences of cities and states that already have successfully intervened in low
       perfonning schools; and from research and development on effective school improvement
       practices; and from business experience in managing high perfonnance organizations and
       in turning around low-perfonning companies. We know of several promising models of
       refom, ranging from the New American Schools designs to Robert Slavin's Success for
       All program. These lessons must be summarized in clear and useable forms, and made
       widely available to educators, parents, state and local policymakers, business leaders, and
       others working to improve public education.

        2. Help states and cities committed to turning around low-performing schools use
        existing Department of Education resources to accomplish this goal. U.S.
        Department of Education programs should help and encourage more states and cities to
        develop and implement sound, comprehensive approaches to turn around low-performing
        schools and help students in them get a better education, and, once developed, should
        support their implementation. The Department should develop a plan to provide training
        and technial assistance to states and cities seeking to turn around failing schools. In
        addition, the Department shoudl inform states and cities with hose they can use funds
        from existing Education Department programs to support their objectives. Many
        programs, such as Title I, Goals 2000, the Public Charter Schools Program, and the 21 st
        Century Schools Program, are well suited for intervening in failing schools, because they
        can be used to provide extra help to students during and after the school day, support high
        quality professional development for teachers, and plan and implement effective school
        refonns. The Education Department should ensure that local school districts can easily
        and effectively access federal funds from such programs and use them in an integrated
      . fashion to support comprehensive efforts to improve low performing schools. Where
        there are statutory barriers to accomplishing this purpose, they should be identified so we
        can work with the Congress to change them. '

       Together, these initiatives can help local school districts turn failing schools into
successful    schools by improving teacher training, strengthening instructional practices,
overhauling school management and implementing schoolwide reforms. They can provide
students     who need it with extra help, during and after school hours. And they can provide
students     with additional choices within the public schools.
