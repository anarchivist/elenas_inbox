TEXT:
Central Americans- James Costello reported that he had just left a two
hour meeting on the regulations and they have not yet decided whether they
will propose a presumption of extreme hardship but they are getting
closer. A couple of meetings will be scheduled to get some closure on
this issue for the Central America trip.  Lamar Smith sent a strongly
worded letter against the presumption. On the other side of the issue,
Hatch, Abraham, Mack, and the several Democrats sent a letter in support.

Public Charge- DOJ will attempt to have by Mid-March the NPRM and either
guidance or interpretative rule (AG must decide which one). They will be
unable to get an answer sooner b/c the AG will be on travel most of the
next couple of week.  On a more technical front, OMB expects the NPRM will
be a major rule requiring that it be sent to Congress. DOJ and INS will
engage with OIRA to ensure quick clearance of this reg.

Mandatory Detention - DOJ/INS is drafting a legislative, administrative
and budget strategy to deal with this issue.     Today, Commissioner
Meissiner testified before Lamar Smith and the hearing was expected to be


contentious (Smith required the Commissioner to be sworn in for her
testimony).  I am following up with INS to find out about the hearing.

H2A - Regulations are pending clearance that would help to streamline the
application process.  I am reviewing these regulations but it is expected
that some will not think that this regulation goes far enough to reform
the H2A system.   In January, five Democratic Senators sent a letter to
the President requesting that they work together to reform the H2A
process.  Coverdell has asked Comm Meissiner to'meet with growers about
this issue and they are meeting next Thursday.  Coverdell has also reached
out to Herman.

Naturalization -
-- Data Report - preliminary reports indicate that INS is on the road to
reach it's naturalization goals.
-- Disabled immigrants -    Guidance to reform this process is expected to
be released next week.   They will allow the person who was featured in NY
Times article to go through the application process again.

New Issues -INS raised 2 new issues - (l) deportations to Honduras had
been prevented due to problems with the Honduran consulate but the issue
has been resolved and deportations will resume (2) INS is working on an
issue that was raised during the ,AFL-CIO meeting reo H2B visas for
shipbuilders in Louisiana - Avendall (sp?).    H2B was created to allow
shipbuilders to bring in workers for training but Avendall requested the
workers but did not provide training.   INS is coming up with a proposal
how to deal with this issue.

please let me know if you have any questions
