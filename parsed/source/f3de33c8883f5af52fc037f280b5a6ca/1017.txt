Director Raines will testify on the PresidentD,s Budget Wednesday morning
before the Joint Economic Committee.

Also on Wednesday, Senator Torricelli will hold a press conference to
announce his vote on the Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA); and House
Coalition members hope to reach agreement on their budget for FY 1998.     (A
Press conference is tentatively set for 2:00pm.)

House Democrats will release their education initiative on Wednesday.  It
will be based on the Administration's plan, but will 1) make Pell an
entitlement, 2) expand the individual grant to $3300, 3) restore the
student loan deduction, 4) not require a B average for eligibility for the
Hope Scholarships,  and 5) propose an emergency reforms assistance program
for schools.


CONGRESS TODAY (2/25):

SENATE:
The Senate adopted (53-46) H.J.Res. 36, the Authorization for Release of
International population Funds.
         [SAP sent, 2/24: Administration strongly supports]

The Senate tabled (55-44) the Reid amendment to the BBA, which would have
excluded the Social Security trust fund from the resolution. Senator
Torricelli introduced an amendment tonight, which would permit capital
budgeting, amend the military waiver, and provide majority waivers for
recession.  The Senate will take up his amendment on Wednesday.

HOUSE:
** No Votes **
After its consideration under suspension of the rules, the House ordered
and postponed votes on H.R. 668, Airport and Airway Trust Fund Tax
Reinstatement Act of 1997. The vote will occur on Wednesday around 1:00
pm.

CONGRESS TOMORROW (2/26)

SENATE
The Senate will convene at 9:00 am to consider the Feinstein substitute
amendment to the BBA for 2 hours, with a vote at 11:00 am.  Compared to

Security, 2) allow a broader military waiver, 3) not require a
super-majority vote to raise the debt limit, and 4) not prohibit capital


budgets.

The Senate will then consider the Torricelli amendment (3 hours debate,

military waiver, and provide majority waivers for recession.
