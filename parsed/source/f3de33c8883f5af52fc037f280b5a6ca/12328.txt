Honorable Edward Kennedy
Ranking Member
Committee on Labor and Human Resources
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Kennedy:

I am writing in strong support of your amendment to legislation under consideration in
the Senate that would increase the minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 an hour by
September 1, 2000. Earlier this year, President Clinton strongly endorsed raising the
minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two years to "do more to support the
millions of parents who give their all every day at home and at work. The most basic
tool of all is a decent income."

We now have the strongest economy in a generation: inflation and unemployment are
low and steady, and family incomes are on the rise. But millions of people are still
struggling to make ends meet -- the people who clean our offices, sew our clothes,
serve our food, and care for our children and our infirm parents. Your amendment
offers more than 11 million Americans a greater opportunity to share in our nation's
prosperity. Seventy percent of all workers who would benefit are adults, age 20 or
over, and about three out of five are women, many of whom are the sole breadwinners
for their families.

When we last raised the minimum wage and expanded the earned-income tax credit,
we took important steps to reward work and help millions of Americans raise their
families with dignity. Because of our actions, a full-time working parent with two children
does not have to live in poverty. We must ensure that this continues to be the case
even as costs rise, and that we continue to make progress towards ensuring that all
working families are lifted out of poverty. That is why we must increase the minimum
wage.

As Americans move from welfare to work, one of the most important lessons they can
learn is that work pays. A full-time worker earning the current minimum wage for 50
weeks of work receives only $10,300. This is not enough to move families from
dependency to self-sufficiency and create a long-term attachment to the workforce.
The real value of the minimum wage had fallen to nearly a 40-year low by the time
President Clinton signed the last increase in 1996. But even after that increase, the
minimum wage's purchasing power remains below its value in the 1960's and 1970's.
The minimum wage should be the first rung on the ladder of opportunity, not a dead
end for the working poor.
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

A one-dollar increase in the minimum wage would make an enormous difference in the
lives of these workers and their families. It would mean an additional $2,000 a year for
someone working year-round, full-time at the minimum wage -- enough to buy a family
of four groceries for 6 months or pay for 7 months rent.

Evidence from the last minimum wage increase clearly shows that we can increase the
minimum wage without hurting the economy. Since President Clinton signed the last
minimum wage increase into law in August 1996, the economy has created more than
seven and a half million new jobs, and the inflation rate has been cut nearly in half. The
unemployment rate is at 4.2 percent and has been below 5 percent for 21 consecutive
months. Unemployment rates this low have not been seen for almost three decades.
For African Americans, Hispanics, and women, unemployment is trending down and
employment rates are trending up. And the news is also good for teenagers -
725,000 more teenagers are employed now than in August 1996, and employment is
up by more than 100,000 for African-American teens.

I strongly support your amendment to increase the minimum wage. Our efforts to
overhaul the education and job training system and expand the earned income tax
credit have significantly advanced our common goal of assuring every worker a good
job at a fair wage. Working together, we can make work pay for America's minimum
wage workers.

                                         Sincerely,


                                         Alexis M. Herman
