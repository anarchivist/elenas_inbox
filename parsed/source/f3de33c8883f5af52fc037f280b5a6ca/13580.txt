TEXT:
FYI
The Supreme Court's Master filed a recommendation in a court case
dating from 1959 involving the disposition of disputed coastal and
submerged lands off ALASKA.
You've got it.   It might have implications for ANWR.  In Alaska,
they may say it opens the issue.
We should be cautious.
1. Haven't seen the Special guys report (but he must be a
Republican) .
2. Adminsitration can take exception to the findings.
3. If Supremes decide according to his recommendations it would,
most likely, happen next spring.
4. ' We would have to agree with the state on exactly which lands
were included in the decision to enter a final decree.
IF the Supremes go with this, the State of ALaska could have what
amounts to a small inholding in refuge. Whether the state could
lease and develop would be highly dependent on numerous factors.
Heads up. More later.
