TEXT:
Last night I circulated for your review and comment a draft Justice letter
on HR 4006 - Rep. Hyde's Lethal Drug Abuse Protection Act.  Justice is
anxious to get its letter to the Senate tomorrow (hearing) and for a House
markup next week.  The deadline for comments is NOON TODAY.

If you didn't receive the fax or have any questions please let me know.
Thanks.
