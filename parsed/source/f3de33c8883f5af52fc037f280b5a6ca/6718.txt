TEXT:
We meet with flue-cured producers from several states yesterday and they
outlined their agreed-upon wish list which is below. Senator Ford will be
sitting down with Helms this week to see if they can come to an
agreement.  Ford is basically willing to go along with $8 a pound, putting
quota into the hands of actual producers, ~nd the purchase intention
(points 1, 3, and.4).  He thinks Helms will find the package excessively
greedy and not defendable for giving an extra $4 for transistion
assistance (point 2), and may not support a price reduction (point 5) .
They both believe they will have a floor fight with Lugar and are inclined
to send the message to farmers now to be realistic. That may work well to
keep the proposals from expanding excessively and allow us to maintain an
ability to arbitrate. We've asked OMB and USDA to price this out as best
as they can without those details which are still being argued about.
