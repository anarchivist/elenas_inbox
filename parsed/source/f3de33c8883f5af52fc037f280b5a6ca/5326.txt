TEXT:
I'd rather not have it used even as a working document or discussion tool
in connection with the Advisory Board meeting, unless there is some really
strong need to do so. However, Education will need to use it as a working
document and show it to relevant groups in order to do the type of
outreach it has done in the past -- e.g. with the Title IX sexual
harrassment guidance. But, they should be able to do this on a low-key
basis.

Also, I think the Race Initiative staff should take a more active role in
reviewing this document and assisting Education and us in producing a
good, useable guide.
