               I will piace special calls to C. Delores, Dorothy Height, Maxine Waters,
               and other key African American women who would love to hear this great
               news!   Also, Ben we can have Ofield Dukes do a special piece. He gets
               great coverage on key appointments in the Black print.

               Beverly Barnes and I discussed this yesterday. We plan to alert the
               African American media and key leaders across the country through our fax
               network. All black radio talk show hosts will get the information on her
               as soon as its available. Additionally, African American leaders from the
               business, clergy, women, and civil rights communities will notified. As
               soon as I get the Bio, I will personally call Simeon Booker of Jet to
               inform him.    When can we meet her? Thanks.
