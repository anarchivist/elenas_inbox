TEXT:
I will collect any contributions DPC would like to make to this effort.
Just drop them off in my office (OEOB 207) by 5:00pm on Friday.  Please
let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you!

On March 8th, the President will address the people of posoltega,
Nicaragua in an event to be held at the local high school.   Posoltega,
along with much of Nicaragua, is still recovering from the devastation
left behind by Hurricane Mitch in November of 1998.   Posoltega suffered
some of the worst damage when a massive mudslide from Las Casitas Volcano
hit the town. Two nearby villages were entirely destroyed by the slides.
It was reported that only 92 of the estimated 2,000 area residents were
found alive, some injured, and the remainder were listed as missing.

Relief efforts have been great, but Posoltega is still lacking essential
supplies.  Over 600 students currently attend classes in makeshift tents.
They are seriously in need of essential school supplies. To help, we
would like to send some supplies with the President to be distributed to
these 4 "tent schools." Dry erase boards, different sizes/shades of
paper, poster board, colored pencils, crayons, markers, tape, notebooks,
scissors, rulers, world globes, basic first aid kits, blank cassettes, and
cassette recorders are among the supplies needed.

If you would like to donate some of these supplies please bring your
donations to Room 184 OEOB by Sunday, March 7. Thank you for your
generosity!

Note:   These can be personal donations only. No government
purchased supplies.  Please do not solicit outside donations.    Thank you!
