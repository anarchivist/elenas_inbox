TEXT:
Marcia tells me that she brought up our.idea of a POTUS meeting with 4 or
5 mayors to talk about our legal immigrant package. We are thinking about
NYC, LA, and 2 dems--Dallas or Houston and a Florida mayor. To allay
Craig's concerns, I'm setting up a meeting early next week to hash it out.
Marcia was going to talk to counsel about restriction re: NYC lawsuit. As
you know I'm a big fan of this idea--so I want to push back on political a
little.
