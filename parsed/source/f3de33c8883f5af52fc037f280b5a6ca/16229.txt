TEXT:
Attached is a revised list of Byrd Rule welfare-to-work issues Chuck is
taking up to the Hill,  hurriedly amended this morning to capture, we
think, the results of the Saturday meeting with the Ds. As Chuck's note
says, we can reach him if there's anything fatal in here.   Let any of us
know if there are significant problems you believe need to be raised,
serious omissions, or other issues that we should consider.

DRAFT - POSSIBLE BYRD RULE VIOLATIONS

[Note: the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list;   it is
limited to identifying which of the objectionable reconciliation
provisions
(i.e. objectionable on policy grounds) may also violate the Byrd Rule.]



o Privatization (Food Stamps and Medicaid): House Passed Bill    (Section
1003,
Food Stamps; and Sec. 3457, Medicaid).   Background:   The House bill
permits
any State to contract with a private sector entity to conduct income
verification and eligibility determinations for Food Stamps and Medicaid.
The
Senate includes no such provisions (dropped per Byrd rule).  The
Administration
strongly opposes the provisions in the House bill and urges the Conferees
to
drop them from consideration. Nature of Byrd violation: the provision does
not
affect federal revenues or outlays.


o Welfare-to-Work:

 --Senate Section 5822(a) (2) (c) --Nonapplication of any minimum wage
requirements with     respect to individual sanctions.    (i.e.,  the
NicklesD! ,
amendment. )

 --(FLSA) House sections 5004 and 5005, and 9004, 9005 -- make people in
workfare and community service activities not employees for purposes of
FLSA;
and counts items other than cash and food stamps for minimum wage  (no
budget
effect)

--Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Work Activity Rules:
Would
limit vocational and educational training as a work activity in TANF;
House
Passed Bill   (sections 9003, 5002), Senate Passed Bill (Sec. 5905(k».
Background: The House bill includes two sets of provisions --one from the
Ways
and Means Committee and the other from the Education and Workforce
Committee
--which narrow the base of eligible recipients against which the cap on
vocational education in TANF applies.    (The Ways and Means Committee also
excludes teen parents in school from the cap and sets the cap at 30
percent of
the narrower base, while the Education and Workforce Committee makes no
other
changes.)   The Senate bill maintains the existing base against which the
cap on
vocational education applies, but removes teen parents who attend school
~




from
the 20 percent cap on vocational education. The Agreement did not address
making changes in the TANF work requirements regarding vocational
education and
educational services for teen parents. The Administration voiced concerns
about these provisions in several letters and urged Conferees to drop them
from
consideration. Nature of Byrd Violation -- no effect on Federal budget

 --TANF transfers to title XX:   House Passed Bill   (Section 9002).
Background: The provisions reported by the House would allow States to
divert
TANF funds away from welfare-to-work efforts to other Title xx social
service
activities.  (The Senate included no such provisions.) The Agreement did
not
address making changes in the TANF transfer provisions. The Administration
voiced concerns about these provisions in several letters and urged
Conferees
to drop them from consideration.    Nature of violation: The provision does
not
effect federal revenues or outlays.
