                      PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
              REMARKS FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS CAMPAIGN RALLY
                            THE WHITE HOUSE
                               MAY 20,1998

         Nearly 35 years ago -- some two decades before most of the children here were even
born -- the Surgeon General of the United States sounded an alarm that has only grown louder,
clearer and more difficult to ignore with every passing year. The warning: Smoking kills.

        And for more than a generation, Americans of all ages and all walks of life have
answered that alarm --fighting tirelessly to conquer this deadly threat and protect the health of
our people. In the face of some very powerful opposition, our nation has won victories both
large and small -- requiring all cigarette packages to ~arry warning labels ... prohibiting cigarette
advertising on the airwaves ... banning smoking on domestic flights ... making all
federally-funded facilities that serve children smoke-free.

       Today, we stand on the verge of our greatest triumph yet against the scourge of tobacco --
a triumph that could save millions of our children's lives and become the one of the greatest
public health achievements in the history of our nation.                 .

         This week, the Senate is considering historic comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco
legislation, proposed by Senator McCain and passed overwhelmingly by the Senate Commerce
Committee. I believe this bill is America's best chance to protect the health of our children, to
keep them from ever getting hooked on cigarettes in the first place. I have said I would
support any comprehensive, bipartisan bill that meets five principles, and this legislation
does so: It raises the price of cigarettes and penalizes companies that sell to kids; it
reaffirms the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products; it stops tobacco companies
from marketing to children; it furthers our other public health goals; and it protects
tobacco farmers and their communities.

        Over the past few weeks, my administration has worked with Congress to strengthen this
bill even further -- toughening penalties against tobacco companies who fail to reduce teen
smoking, raising the liability cap on legal damages, protecting Americans from dangerous
second-hand smoke in public buildings.

       I congratulate every child here for taking responsibility for your own health, for saying
"no" to tobacco and "yes" to brighter futures. I wish you well as you make your voices heard on
Capitol Hill. Now it is time for America's elected leaders to do our part.

        The McCain bill is tough, fair, and most of all, it protects our children. It would stop the
Marlboro man from roping in any more of our children -- and keep Joe Camel from tricking them
into lighting up. It ends the unscrupulous marketil1g campaigns that have targeted our children


                                                  I
                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

-- and robbed them of their futures. So I call upon Congress to stay in session for as long as it
takes to pass this bill. Don't go home until you have given our children bipartisan,
comprehensive tobacco law. They have waited long enough.

        Today, here on the South Lawn, stand America's future. For years, the tobacco
companies have looked upon these children and seen the "replacement smokers" of the 21st
Century. But I see 1,400 unique, irreplaceable children with unlimited potential. I see the
scientists and artists; the teachers and Olympic champions; the engineers and leaders of the 21 st
Century. Everyone of us has the responsibility to make sure these and all children across
America have the opportunity to live out their dreams and fulfill their greatest, God-given
potential. That is why we must pass this bill.

        Let the children standing here be the final, triumphant generation of young leaders who
fought to protect future generations from tobacco. And let this Congress be the Congress that
saved their lives.
