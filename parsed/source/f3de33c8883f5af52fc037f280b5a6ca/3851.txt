Subject: Commission immigration recommendations


FYI -- The Commission on Immigration Reform includes other options that it
presents favorably in its draft report that you may not be aware of:

1) Establish a new Cabinet Level Department or Independent Agency -- One
option
is creation of a new Department or independent agency "simiilar to the
Environmental Protection Agency" to provide leadership on immigration
issues.

2)  "Strengthening the Domestic Policy Council" -- The Commission
believes that
it would be a good idea to establish a new policy development and
coordination
mechanism at the Domestic Policy Council -- an "Office for Immigration
Policy" .
It cites as a possible model the NSC's Office of Democracy, Human Rights
and
Humanitarian Affairs.

3)  Creating New Offices at the Departmental Level to Coordinate
Immigration
Matters. This would entail consolidating all immigration matters into a
single


office at each department. For example, at DOL, there would be a new
Assistant
Secretary for Immigration Affairs.

4) "Establishing a Standing Body Responsible for Immigration Policy."
Perhaps
something along the lies of the Civil Rights Commission or the FCC that
would be
responsible for policy development but not policy implementation.


So these are some of the ideas the Commission is advancing as options to
improve
immigration policy and operations.


I have discussed with Jose some of merits of the severing DOJ/INS
responsibilities and spreading them across the Administration.

A couple of more thoughts: The immigration debate remains highly
political and
highly-charged and the Commission's views must be interpreted in that
context.
This remains a minefield and these "good government" proposals are not
necessarily as neutral as they appear on their face.

There are reasons why Harold Ezell -- the father of Prop. 187 -- supports
breaking up the INS.  There are reasons why Lamar Smith and Pete Wilson
like the
idea while taking every opportunity to criticize the President on
immigration.
Many of these attacks of the Administration's immigration efforts are not
designed to improve anything, they are simply a means of politically
attacking
the Administration and also immigrants.   I understand, for example, that
the
fees for immigration services might have to be raised beyond the ability
of
many to pay if immigration activities are split across the
Administration. The
Commission does not address this concern.

It is worth noting that the Commission's report acknowledges that the
other
agencies that would take.on new immigration responsibilities have their
own
operational problems, but the Commission makes no attempt to assess
whether
they could overcome those problems to improve upon DOJ's work in
immigration.

In addition, as has always been the case, the Commission makes
recommendations
without considering cost. That has always been part of their problem
they
make recommendations without any consideration for cost effectiveness or
total
costs for implementation.

Obviously, none of this means that substantial reform to improve


immigration
enforcement and services is not appropriate -- obviously it is crucial --
but
that is not necessarily what is going on here.


There are some who believe strongly that one of the reasons that the
Commission
wanted to review INS management (which is NOT part of their statutory
charter)
is because when the Commission goes out of business after its final report
this
Fall, a few members of the Commission and some of its staff would like to
be put
in charge of any new Department or independent agency or office that might
be
created. who knows.


Anyway, I hope that some part of this is helpful to you.


Thanks.
