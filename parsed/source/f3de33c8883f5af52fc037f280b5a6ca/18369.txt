MEMORANDUM

TO:            Sylvia Mathews
               Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff

FROM:          Judith A. Winston
               Executive Director

DATE: January 9, 1998

SUBJECT:       Summary Report of January 6, 1998 Discussion of Advisory Board Workplan and
               Products through FY 1998


Attached is a revised schedule for Advisory Board activities through FY 1998. It reflects the
discussion held on January 6. The schedule includes suggested topics for Advisory Board
meetings. Some topics which may warrant Advisory Board attention are not included due to
time constraints. However, it may be worth exploring whether a way should be found to include
these topics. Among these topics are access to health care, equal housing opportunities, and the
meaning of being an American in the One America envisioned by the President.

There was considerable discussion at the meeting regarding products which will result from the
work of the Advisory Board. A general consensus formed around six products, and they are
outlined below. Other products related to Board meetings and Board member activity are being
proposed and developed, and we should have a separate meeting to discuss them.

Products from Advisory Board

1.     Advisory Letters to the President from Dr. John Hope Franklin on behalf of the
       President's Advisory Board:

These letters would be prepared following each meeting of the Advisory Board. The substance
of these letters would be the provision of advice to the President on matters relating to the topic
of the Advisory Board meeting.
2.                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
       Individual Board Members Feedback to the President:

Advisory Board members have been provided with standard forms on which to provide feedback
to the Initiative following each activity in which they engage as an Advisory Board member. On
a monthly basis each Board member will summarize (perhaps with staff assistance) such
feedback, particularly as it relates to the identification of promising practices, the recruitment of
leaders, and the fostering of dialogues, and provide it in written form to the President.

3.     Leadership Recruitment for On-going Activities:

The members of the Advisory Board will identify and recruit leaders who will continue to engage
in racial reconciliation activities following the conclusion ofthe work of the Advisory Board.
For example, through the corporate outreach effort, Bob Thomas will identify leaders in the
corporate sector; through the religious outreach effort, Rev. Suzan Johnson Cook will identify
leaders in the faith community; through activities with organizations of public officials,
Governors Winter and Kean will identify leaders among public officials. All Board members
will be involved in the effort to identify and recruit leaders. On the feedback form mentioned in
item 2, Board members are encouraged to identify leaders in communities they visit.

4.     Promotion of Dialogues

Through the use and distribution of One America Conversation Packets and the more
comprehensive Race Dialogue How-To Kits, Advisory Board members will encourage dialogues
in communities they visit. Among the issues which need to be resolved are ways in which to
record these dialogues, receive feedback from them, measure their quantity and effectiveness,
and obtain press attention for them. The Board, with staff assistance, will develop a written
summary of efforts to promote and sustain dialogue.

5.     Promising Practices

Advisory Board members, during their visits to various communities, will identify promising
practices and report them to the Initiative staff. Also, through regular communications with
Initiative staff, Board members will receive reports of promising practices for inclusion in
speeches as examples of how communities can work toward racial reconciliation. One example
could be a reference to Boston's Team Harmony Project as something that could be replicated
elsewhere.

6.     Summaries of Advisory Board Meetings and Town Halls

Following each Advisory Board meeting and Town Hall, Initiative staff will produce a detailed
summary of the event, including information gathered, opinions expressed, conclusions reached,
and follow-up planned. These summaries will be transmitted by Dr. Franklin to the President in
a timely fashion.
