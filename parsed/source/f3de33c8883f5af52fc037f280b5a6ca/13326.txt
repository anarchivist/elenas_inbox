TEXT:
 [obviously] the "undermine or inconsistent" language is confusing,
but I would suggest just going with "inconsistent" and leave it at
that. The industry is NOT currently attacking the plan through
these provisions; indeed, Rutzick has denied ever thinking abou
it (whether we believe him is not the point.) Actually, the
subset of enviros who have always opposed the plan are more likely
to be the successful plaintiffs in attacking the plan itself, if
we're not allowed to supplement.
The other option 9 issue that has been in court is the issue of
judicial review and Hogan's finding that the rider shields all
sales within the area of option 9 from judicial review.   That
has lead both Rutzick and enviros to say (correctly, under Hogan's
ruling) th~t Implementation of the plan is now strictly a matter
of policy. The Administration intended it to be a matter of law
(or more accurately, judicially reviewable rulemaking) .


    In short, I would just leave it at "inconsistent".  "Undermine"
    will provoke denials, speculation and unhealthy thinking.
