TEXT:
The YMCA of the USA has invited me to speak at their National Symposium of
their 150 CEOS on Friday evening November 21st in Milwaukee. While I
generally loath travel, I think this could be worthwhile since I could
combine it with a visit to a Wisconsin welfare to work site.   On
Wednesday of that week we're tentatively planning to have the Welfare to
Work Partnership event here, so I would leave sometime after that.

Unless any of you object. I'll send Cathy a copy of the invitation to
begin the process with White House counsel.
