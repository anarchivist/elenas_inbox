TEXT:
Sorri I had to miss the staff meeting, I've had a couple of people tell me
that you mentioned an AmeriCorps announcement that the VP could make.  I
passed along information to Jon Schnur about an event that AmeriCorps was
planning for the President to announce the kickoff a nationwide recruiting
drive, highlight its FY2000 budget number, celebrate the 100,000th member
and release a report on AmeriCorps effectiveness.  Is that the
announcement(s) you were thinking of?
