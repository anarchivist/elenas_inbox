TEXT:
The lawyer for survivors held a press briefing today, which has
precipitated a lot of questions re President's position on an apology.
Scheduling is looking at a mid-May date for the apology event. At our
meeting, we agreed to advise Rahm/McCurry that the WH should say in this
news cycle that the President decided in March to issue an apology and
will meet w/survivors as soon as that meeting can be scheduled.  Kitty in
particular felt that POTUS would not be happy to see news reports that
he's still considering what to do when he signed a memo a month ago saying
we should go ahead withe apology.  I agreed.   Not sure yet how McCurry's
office has followed up.

HHS has put three policy proposals on the table to announce at an event
one with some promise, but I've asked them to flesh it out more.  I'll
keep you posted.
