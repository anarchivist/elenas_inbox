TEXT:
Where are we on following up on Charlie Rangel's idea of coordinators in
some key areas to help access and coordinate the various education and
other resources that could help improve schools--like the educational
opportunity zones of last year? Also--how are we monitoring how the dept
of education is implementing the Hispanic Education monies of last year; I
understand that Janet and Barbara Chow met today to try to get their arms
around this since Hispanic Caucus and NCLR have been asking about this? Br
uce, have you hired someone to take Mike's spot and will that person be
able to follow up on this stuff?
