TEXT:
Is it useful for me to send out the notice on the weekly? I know some
people are sending you their submissions directly, so I don't know if I
should continue to send out the notice or format the other bullets if you
would prefer to do it yourself.

Please let me know what is the most helpful thing for me to do.   Thanks.
