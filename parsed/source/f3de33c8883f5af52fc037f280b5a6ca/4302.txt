TEXT:
        We would like to schedule a quick meeting to go over any comments
on the draft E.O. Both Bill and Lisa thought we should meet before we
circulate to a larger group (and before I leave Friday).  Because Sally
will be out of town Tuesday through Thurday mid-day, we have limited
options. We have scheduled the meeting for 3:00 -3:30 p.m. on Thursday.
Let me know if this does not work.  Otherwise, we'll see you Thursday in
Room 260 (not Sally's office) OEOB.  Thanks.
