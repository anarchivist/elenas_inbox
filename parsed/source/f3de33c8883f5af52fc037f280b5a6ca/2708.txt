America is moving closer to fulfilling its fundamental promise of ensuring equality and the
opportunity for advancement for all. President Clinton has worked to restore the American
dream by expanding the economy, ensuring equal opportunity, investing in education and
making our communities safer. Since President Clinton entered office, the economy has created
over 10 million new jobs, the unemployment rate for Mrican-Americans has declined nearly 30
and over 100,000 new African-American businesses have been created.

But more needs to be done. The unemployment rate for Mrican-Americans remains twice that
of whites and discrimination remains a daily fact of life for too many Americans.
Mrican-Americans are still more likely to be victims of murder, robberies and aggravated assaults.
 That is why President Clinton will continue to work to ensure that all Americans have the
security and equal opportunity needed to develop to their full potential.

A RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT:

·      HeJping Every American Achieve Economic Security in the New Economy.
             Oversaw the creation of more than 12.1 million new jobs in just over four years --  a
             faster annual rate of job growth than any Republican Administration since the
             1920's.
             For adult African-Americans, the unemployment rate dipped to 9.8 in April -- one
             of the lowest rates in 20 years. This is the 35th consecutive month that the
             unemployment rate for adult African-Americans has been in the single digits.
             (When President Clinton took office in January 1993, the unemployment rate for
             Mrican-American adults was 12.5 .)
             Under President Clinton, the typical Mrican-American family's income is up $3,000.
             Since 1992, the median income of Mrican-American families has increased from
             $22,923 to $25,393 -- that means their income was $3.047 higher in 1995 than the
             year before President Clinton took office.
             The Mrican-American poverty rate dropped to its lowest level in. history. In 1995,       the A
             More than 1.3 million Mrican-Americans are benefitting from the
                                                                                            Preside
                                                                                   nt's proposal
                                                                                   to raise the
                                                                                   minImum
                                                                                   wage to $5.15
                                                                                   an hour.
             Made new tax cuts available to 90 of small businesses.
             Lowest combined rates of unemployment and inflation since 1968.

·      Fighting for EquaJ Opportunity.
             Appointed the most diverse Cabinet and Administration in history.
             Members of the' Clinton Cabinet include three African-Americans, one
             Hispanic-American and four women.


                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
         President Clinton has to date nominated 46 African-Americans to the federal bench
         -- over 18 of total federal bench nominations. Overall, 65 of President Clinton's
         judicial appointees have been rated "well qualified" by the American Bar Association
         -- the highest percentage achieved by any Administration since the ABA began
         rating judicial candidates during the Eisenhower Administration.
         Over 55 of the President's judicial nominees are women and minorities -- the
         highest proportion ever.
         More African-American appointees (33) are serving in the White House than at any
         time in history.
         Ordered a. review of the government's affirmative action programs which concluded
         that affirmative action is still an effective and important tool to expand educational
         and economic opportunity.
         The Administration argued in federal court to expand the Voting Rights Act and
         defended racially fair redistricting plans against claims they were unconstitutional.
         The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has filed more cases in the last three
         years to enforce fair housing laws than any other Administration -- a record 457
         cases.
         The Department of Housing and Urban Development actively intervened and
         desegregated a Texas public housing complex.
         The Treasury Department, working with the Justice Department, ordered a
         Mississippi bank to implement remedial lending plans for minority customers once
         denied loans by the bank.
         Made voting easier for more than 11 million Americans by creating more accessible
         "motor-voter" registration locations. (National Voter Registration Act)

·   Providing Educational Opportunities for the New Century:
         In 1995, the number of PhD's awarded to African-American students increased 17
         over 1994.
         Increased funding for Historically Black Colleges by nearly $250 million since
         FY1992, an almost 25 increase.
         Established the President's Board of Advisors for Historically Black Colleges and
         Universities to strengthen the capacity of historically black colleges and universities
         to provide quality education by advising on ways to increase the private sector's role
         in these institutions.                                                       .
         Increased Head Start fundi rig by nearly $800 million to provide early education to
         tens of thousands of additional children in need.
         Supported the development of standards of excellence for students while
         encouraging grassroots reforms to improve our schools. (GOALS 2000: Educate
         America Act)
         Gave schools greater flexibility to use federal aid and develop effective teaching
         innovations to help students achieve their full potential. (Improving America's
         Schools Act)
         Launched an Educational Technology Initiative to connect every classroom to the
         Information Superhighway and provide all students with access to computers by the
         Proposed spending $5 billion to help local communities and states rebuild the
         nation's schools.
         Encouraged schools, colleges and employers to join in creating school-to-work              oppo
         Enabled 45,000 volunteers to earn money for college by serving their communities
         and their country in the AmeriCorps program, with African Americans comprising
         one-third of all participants. (National Service Act)

         Reformed the federal student loan program, making college more affordable this
         year for millions of students in the Direct Lending program and others who will
         have access to flexible repayment options, including pay-as-you-earn plans. Over
         1,700 schools, representing 50 of the total amount of loans, are expected to
         participate in the Direct Lending program this year. (Student Loan Reform Act)
         Proposed America's Hope Scholarships to make access to two-years of college
         universal by providing students with a $1,500 refundable tax credit for full-time
         tuition in their first year of college and another $1,500 credit in their second year if
         they work hard, stay off drugs and earn at least a B average in their first year. This
         $1,500 tax credit will pay for more than the full cost of tuition at the national
         average-priced community colleges.

·   Cherishing Children and Strengthening Families.
         Provided tax relief for 15 million working families by increasing the Earned Income
         Tax Credit to allow more families to qualify for tax rebates. In 1995, the EITC
         lifted over 832,000 African-Americans, including 450,000 African-American
         children, out of poverty.
         Helped families move from welfare to work by authorizing 43 states to bypass
         existing welfare rules and set time limits on benefits, require recipients to work or
         stay in school, provide child care and give employers incentives to hire welfare
         recipients.
         Helped move 2.9 million people from welfare to work -- decreasing welfare rolls by
         20 since taking office.
         Breaking the cycle of welfare dependency by requiring teenage mothers to live at
         home, stay in school and turn their lives around.
         Implemented a new child support enforcement project to help track down
         non-paying parents across state lines; challenged states to adopt new hire programs
         to catch delinquent parents who move from job to job; and issued new regulations
         to require women who apply for welfare to comply with paternity establishment
         requirements before receiving benefits, except in cases of rape or threat to the
         mother's safety.
         Collected a record $11 billion in child support in 1995 through tougher enforcement
         -- a nearly 40 increase over 1992.
         Worked with community, business and religious leaders to form a new National
         Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.
         Enabled workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a family
         member without fear of losing their jobs. (Family and Medical Leave Act). The
         President has proposed expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act to better help
         workers care for their families without sacrificing their work obligations. The
         their children's educational needs, older relatives' health care and other family
         medical and dental obligations.
         Proposed an employee choice flex-time initiative that will allow workers to agree
         with their employers to work overtime in exchange for up to 80 hours of paid
         time-off ("flex-time"). Under the President's proposal, workers could choose to
         receive time-and-a-half in flex-time or in cash pay for each hour of overtime and
         could use their accumulated flex-time for any purpose.
         Established a Childhood Immunization Initiative to ensure vaccinations and healthy
         futures for all children. In 1995, 75 of two-year-old children were properly
         immunized, an historic high. In 1996, contraction rates among for Measles,
         Mumps, and Rubella were substantially reduced.
         Put the Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC) on a full funding path.
         Established the Office of Minority Health Research and Alternative Medicine at the
         National Institute of Health.
         Proposed a comprehensive initiative to cut off children's access to tobacco products
         and reduce their appeal to children.
         Gave parents greater control over what their children watch on television by
         announcing a breakthrough agreement with the media and entertainment industry to
         develop a television ratings system and by requiring the installation of anti-violence
         screening chips ("V -chips") in all new televisions.

·   Taking Back Our Streets From Crime, Gangs and Drugs:
         Focused the nation's attention and resources to help stop the rash of church
         burnings across the country, prosecute those responsible and speed the rebuilding
         process.
         Filed a record 42 cases involving hate crimes in FY 1995, involving 66 defendants --
         the second highest number charged in one year.
         Signed into law the toughest, most comprehensive Crime Bill ever, which puts
         100,000 new police officers on the street -- more than 43,000 officers have already
         been funded.
         Stood up to the gun lobby and won passage of the Brady Bill -- as a result, more
         than 150,000 fugitives, felons, and stalkers have already been blocked from buying
         guns.
         Banned the manufacture and importation of 19 of the deadliest assault weapons
         while specifically protecting more than 650 legitimate sporting weapons. (Assault
         Weapons Ban)
         Keeping dangerous weapons out of our children's classrooms by enforcing a "Zero
         Tolerance" gun policy in schools.
         Reducing violence and drug abuse in our schools by investing in school security,
         drug prevention programs and counseling. (Safe and Drug Free Schools Act)
         Encouraged schools to consider adopting school uniform policies to reduce violence
         while promoting discipline and respect; communities to implement curfews to get
         children off the streets and out of harms way; and teachers and law enforcement to
         enforce truancy laws so that children are learning about life in school and not on the
         streets.
         Instituted a tough "One-Strike-And-You're-Out" policy in public housing for those
         who engage in criminal activity.
         Developed a comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy that will reduce illegal

·        Creating Opportunity in America's Communities.
              Created nine Economic Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities that
              use tax incentives and flexible grants to promote economic empowerment and
              private sector job creation in 104 distressed communities across America.
              Creating a network of community development banks and financial institutions in
              low and moderate-income communities which leverages $10 of private investment
              for every $1 of federal investment. With $50 million appropriated for 1997 and
              $1.625 billion requested in the President's budget proposal for the next seven years,
              matc'hing capital and other assistance will be provided to create and expand
              community development banks and financial institutions. (Community Development
              Banks and Financial Institutions Fund)
              Made the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and Mortgage Revenue Bond Program
              permanent increasing opportunities for affordable housing development by the
              private sector.
              Reformed the Community Reinvestment Act to focus on performance -- actual
              lending, investments and basic banking services -- rather than paperwork. The
              reforms will unleash billions in new credit to low- to moderate-income
              communities.

·        Leaving Our Environment Safe and Clean for the Next Generation:
              Issued an Executive Order on Environmental Justice, ensuring that low income
              citizens and minorities do not suffer a disproportionate burden of industrial
              pollution.
              Identified 20 environmental justice pilot projects to be undertaken across the country

              useable space, creating jobs and enhancing community development.
              Launched a Brownfields Initiative to return land to productive use by providing tax
              incentives to clean-up old industrial waste sites.
              Completed nearly as many toxic waste site clean ups in each of the past two              years'
dumps.

·        Maintaining America's Leadership in the Fight for Freedom and Peace:
              Restored democracy to Haiti, enabling the first transfer of power from one
              democratically elected president to another in Haitian history.

May 1997

One of our nation's greatest strengths is its vast diversity. Since our country's inception,
Hispanic-Americans have always had an integral role in shaping America's history, economy and
traditions. Many of the ideals that all Americans live by are deeply rooted in the Hispanic
values of a strong sense of family, hard work, service to country and religious faith.

President Clinton is leading the way to enable Hispanic-Americans to participate at all levels of
American society and have a greater role in boardrooms, schoolrooms and the halls of .
government. The President has worked to make the American dream a real possibility for all
Americans and to ensure that the hopes and dreams of Hispanic-Americans are attainable.

A RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT:

·      Helping Every American Achieve Economic Security in the New Economy
             Oversaw the creation of more than 12.1 million new jobs in only three-and-a-half
             years -- a faster annual rate of job growth than any Republican Administration since
             the 1920's.
             The President proposed to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour -- directly
             benefitting more than 1.6 million Hispanic-Americans.
             The unemployment rate for Hispanic-Americans in April was 8.1 ,down from 1l.3
             when President Clinton first took office.
             Over 220,000 new Hispanic-American-owned businesses have been created in the
             first three years of the Clinton Administration.
             After more than a decade of decline, 1 million new manufacturing and construction
             jobs have been created since President Clinton took office.
             Passed the largest deficit-cutting plan in history -- saving more than $1 trillion over
             7 years.
             Lowest combined rate of unemployment and inflation since 1968.
             Made new tax cuts available to over 90 of small businesses.
             Proposed safeguarding workers' pensions and health care by simplifying pensions
             and protecting health insurance for people who change or lose their jobs.

·      Fighting for EquaJ Opportunity.
             Appointed the most diverse Cabinet and Administration in history. Members of
             the Clinton cabinet include two Hispanic-Americans, Henry Cisneros, Secretary of
             Housing and Urban Development, and Federico Pena, Secretary of Transportation.
             A record number (20) of all judicial appointments are Hispanic-Americans,
             including the first Mexican-American judge in Los Angeles and the first Hispanic
             judge in Chicago. Overall, 63 of President Clinton's Latino judicial appointees
             have been rated "well qualified" by the American Bar Association -- the highest
             percentage achieved by any Administration since the ABA began rating judicial
             candidates during the Eisenhower Administration.
             Over 55 of the President's judicial nominees are women and minorities -- the

         Appointed more Hispanic-Americans to senior level positions than any President in
         American history. Significantly, these appointments are outside what had been
         considered the "traditional" Hispanic areas of interest.
         Ordered a comprehensive review of the government's affirmative action programs
         which concluded that affirmative action remains an effective and important tool to
         expand education and economic opportunity to all Americans.
         Opposed California's Proposition 187 due to its detrimental impact on children and
                                           its threat to public health.
         Authorized a nationwide investigation of discrimination by financial institutions         to he
         Made voting easier for more than 11 million Americans by creating more accessible
         "motor-voter" registration locations. (National Voter Registration Act)

·   Providing Educational Opportunities for the New Century:
         Established an advisory commission to oversee the improvement in education for
         Hispanics and to ensure that Hispanic-serving institutions will have more input
         regarding educational goals and issues of concern to Hispanic-Americans.
         (Executive Order on Educational Excellence for Hispanic-Americans)
         Increased funding for the Office of Bilingual Education & Minority Languages
         Affairs and opposed plans to abolish bilingual education.
         Opposed congressional efforts to deny the children of undocumented                 immigrants t
         Increased Head Start funding by nearly $800 million to provide early education to
         tens of thousands of additional children in need.
         Supported the development of standards of excellence for students while
         encouraging grassroots reforms' to improve our schools. (GOALS 2000: Educate
         America Act)
         Gave schools greater flexibility to use federal aid and develop effective teaching
         innovations to help students achieve their full potential. (Improving America's
         Schools Act)

         nation's schools.
         Encouraged schools, colleges and employers to join in creating school-to-work            oppo
         Enabled 45,000 volunteers to earn money for college by serving their communities
         and their country in the AmeriCorps program, with Hispanics comprising 14 of all
         participants. (National Service Act)
         Reformed the federal student loan program, making college more affordable this
         year for millions of students in the Direct Lending program and others who will
         have access to flexible repayment options, including pay-as-you-earn plans. Over
         1,300 schools, representing 25 of the total amount of loans, are expected to
         participate in the Direct Lending program this year. (Student Loan Reform Act)
         universal by providing students with a $1,500 refundable tax credit for full-time
         tuition in their first year of college and another $1,500 credit in their second year if
         they work hard, stay off drugs and earn at least a B average in their first year. This
         $1,500 tax credit will pay for more than the full cost of tuition at the national
         average-priced community colleges.
         Called for a tax deduction of up to $10,000 per year for the cost of college tuition
         and training. Families could deduct up to $10,000 in tuition and fees for
         post-secondary education. Over 17 million students and over 14 million families
         stand to benefit from this proposal for tax relief to working families.

·   Cherishing Children and Strengthening Families.
         Provided tax relief for 15 million working families by increasing the Earned Income
         Tax Credit to allow more families to qualify for tax rebates. In 1995, the EITC
         lifted over 888,000 Hispanic-Americans, including 446,000 Hispanic children, out
         of poverty.
         Helped families move from welfare to work by authorizing 40 states to bypass
         existing welfare rules and set time limits on benefits, require recipients to work or
         stay in school, provide child care and give employers incentives to hire welfare
         recipients.
         Helped reduce welfare rolls 20 since taking office -- 2.9 million fewer recipients.
         Breaking the cycle of welfare dependency by requiring teenage mothers to live at
         home, stay in school and turn their lives around.
         Implemented a new child support enforcement project to help track down
         non-paying parents across state lines; challenged states to adopt new hire programs
         to catch delinquent parents who move from job to job; and issued new regulations
         to require women who apply for welfare to comply with paternity establishment
         requirements before receiving benefits, except in cases of rape or threat to the
         mother's safety.
         Collected a record $11 billion in child support in 1995 through tougher enforcement
         -- a nearly 40 increase over 1992.
         Worked with community, business and religious leaders to form a new National
         Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.
         Enabled workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a family
         member without fear of losing their jobs. (Family and Medical Leave Act)          The
         President has proposed expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act to better help
         workers care for their families without sacrificing their work obligations. The
         expansion will allow workers to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave in support of
         their children's educational needs, older relatives' health care and other family
         medical and dental obligations.
         Proposed an employee choice flex-time initiative that will allow workers to agree
         with their employers to work overtime in exchange for up to 80 hours of paid
         time-off ("flex-time"). Under the President's proposal, workers could choose to
         receive time-and-a-halfin flex-time or in cash pay for each hour of overtime and
         could use their accumulated flex-time for any purpose.
         futures for all children. In 1995, 75 of two-year-old children were properly
         immunized -- an historic high. In 1996, contraction rates for Measles, Mumps, and
         Rubella were substantially reduced.
         Put the Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC) on a full funding path.
         Established the Office of Minority Health Research and Alternative Medicine at the
         National Institute of Health.
         Proposed a comprehensive initiative to cut off children's access to tobacco products
         and reduce their appeal to children.
         Gave parents greater control over what their children watch on television by
         announcing a breakthrough agreement with the media and entertainment industry to
         develop a television ratings system and by requiring the installation of anti-violence
         screening chips ("V -chips") in all new televisions.

·   Taking Back Our Streets From Crime, Gangs and DrugS'.
         Signed into law the toughest most comprehensive Crime Bill ever, which puts
         100,000 more police officers on the street -- more than 43,000 officers have already
         been funded.
         Stood up to the gun lobby and won passage of the Brady Bill -- as a result, more
         than 150,000 fugitives and felons have already been blocked from buying guns.
         Banned the manufacture and importation of 19 of the deadliest assault weapons
         while specifically protecting more than 650 legitimate sporting weapons. (Assault
         Weapons Ban)

         Tolerance" gun policy in schools.
         Reducing violence and drug abuse in our schools by investing in school security,
         drug prevention programs and counseling. (Safe and Drug Free Schools Act)
         Encouraged schools to consider adopting school uniform policies to reduce violence
         while promoting discipline and respect; communities to implement curfews to get
         children off the streets and out of harms way; and teachers and law enforcement to
         enforce truancy laws so that children are learning about life in school and not on the
         streets.
         Instituted a tough "One-Strike-And-You're-Out" policy in public housing for those
         who engage in criminal activity.
         Developed a comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy that will reduce illegal
         drug use through law enforcement, prevention, treatment and interdiction.

·   Supporting Legal Immigration:
         Made "naturalization" a top priority of the Immigration and Naturalization               Servi
         Launched Citizenship USA to ensure that by September 1996, eligible persons who
         apply for citizenship will be approved by the Immigration and Naturalization
         Service within six months. Citizenship USA has been implemented in Los
         Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami and Chicago
         -- cities that represent more than 75 of all pending citizenship applications.
     ·        Creating Opportunity in America's Communities:
                   Created nine Economic Empowerment Zones and 95 Enterprise Communities
                   which use tax incentives and flexible grants to promote economic empowerment and

                   Creating a network of community development banks and financial institutions in
                   low- and moderate-income communities which leverages $10 of private investment
                   for every $1 of federal investment. With $50 million appropriated for 1995 and
                   $1.625 billion requested in the President's budget proposal for the next seven years,
                   matching capital and other assistance will be provided to create and expand

                   Reformed the Community Reinvestment Act to focus on performance -- actual
                   lending, investments and basic banking services -- rather than paperwork. The
                   reforms will unleash billions in new credit to low- to moderate-income
                   communities.

     ·        Leaving Our Environment Safe and Clean for the Next Generation:
                   Issued an Executive Order on Environmental Justice, ensuring that low income

                   pollution.
                   Identified 20 environmental justice pilot projects to be undertaken across the country
                   to redevelop contaminated sites in low-income communities and turn them into
                   useable space, creating jobs and enhancing community development.
                   Launched a Brownfields Initiative to return land to productive use by providing tax
                   incentives to clean-up old industrial waste sites.
                   Completed nearly as many toxic waste site clean ups in each of the past two              years

                   in confiscated properties in Cuba. Awarded a landmark $500,000 grant to
                   Freedom House to assist human rights activists in Cuba.
