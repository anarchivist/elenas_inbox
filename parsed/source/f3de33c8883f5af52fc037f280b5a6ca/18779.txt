TEXT:
Carl Feldbaum assures me that BIO has not changed their position and would
continue to object to a Bond-like bill that limits cloning research.  BIO
would support Feinstein's bill without the forfeiture clause, and would
prefer that the sunset be shortened to 5 years. Although he may make
conciliatory noises to the Majority, he says that should not be
interpreted as a softening of their position.   I have a call in to PhRMA
