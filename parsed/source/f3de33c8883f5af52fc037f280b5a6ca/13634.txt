TEXT:

1.) how are you?
2.) any news on cancellation brief?
3.) what do you think about the last line in the draft USDA
guidance on alternative timber, i.e., if these steps are
unsuccessful, FS will exercise their right to cancel the
contracts? I assume that Rutzick already knows everything we're
thinking and writing, but do you have concerns about putting it in
this memo at this stage this way? I'm vaguely uneasy.
          do you see any legal distintion between our ability to
cancel contracts that fall under k(1) and k(3)? Seems to me that
we have an affirmative obligation to offer alt. timber under k(3),
and since it's not dependent on purchasers' agreement, don't we
just make a good faith offer and that's that? One reason I think
that rather bald statement at the end of the USDA draft concerns
me is that it sounds as though all alt. timber is negotiated and
then we go to cancellation if that doesn't work.  I think it has
to make a much sharper distinction between k(1) and k(3).   But I
didn't want to go down this road in the more general e-mail. until
we'd had a chance to deal with this.
