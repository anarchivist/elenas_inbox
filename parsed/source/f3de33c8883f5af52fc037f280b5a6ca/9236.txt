TEXT:
We expect the bilingual bill to come up tomorrow; the whip count suggests
it will pass, roughly 220-209.  I've asked OMB to get our SAP up there
tomorrow; we had developed it last August in anticipation of a vote before
recess.  Elena--you signed off on this; I'll make sure that OMB sends the
one we have approved.
