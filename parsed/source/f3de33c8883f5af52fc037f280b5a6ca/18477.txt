TEXT:
 A TIME/CNN poll says they want to slash the national
                  debt accumulated in those deficit-spending years. Maybe
they feel guilty
                  about their own credit-card bills or are worried that
today's prosperity
                  could melt into tomorrow's slowdown. And while those
polled like some
                  of Clinton's spending plans, such as expanded Medicare,
they are less
                  certain about him. Most believe that America is better
off than in 1992,
                  but that Clinton has turned out to be an "average"
President.

                 Which of these proposals about how to spend some of the
budget
                  surplus should be a top priority or high priority?

                 Reducing the national debt-- 78%
                 Providing more tax credits for child care-- 74%
                 Extending Medicare to include some 55- to 64-year-old
Americans--
                  71%
                  Cutting federal income taxes-- 68%
                  Ending the income tax "marriage penalty"-- 50%
                  Increasing spending on federal highway programs-- 44%
