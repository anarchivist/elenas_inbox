TEXT:
BR:

To follow-up on my message ... 1 spoke briefly to DOJ, and it looks like the
hiring grants for Thursday have to move forward (Hill VIPs have already
been notified).   However, the LA piece -- $100 million for 700 cops     is
still being ironed out and could probably be held 'til next week if we act
now.   Ray Fisher is scheduled to meet w/Riordan tomorrow, and Boxer is
schedule to be notified tomorrow morning -- so we have to get w/DOJ on
this tonight if we think it's worth doing.

Are options are: (1) have DOJ hold LA and do it -- and the $200 million in
MORE grants w/POTUS next Thursday; (2) same as option 1, but do it for
taped radio address while in CA; or (3) let LA grant move forward this
Thursday and have POTUS do a conference call w/Riordan to get in the local
story.
