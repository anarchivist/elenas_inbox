Dear Anna:

     Thank you for writing concerning legislation
to create national uniform standards for certain
types of securities litigation.    The new regime put
in place by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act is still in its infancy, and one of the issues
that will need to be considered as we gain experience
with the Act is how its provisions affect the roles
of state and federal courts in private securities
fraud litigation.

      The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
has just released a report that I requested, assessing
the effects of last year's legislation, including
the Act's impact on litigation, investor protection,
and information made available to investors.    We will
be reviewing the SEC study and other reports and data
to as~ess the need for further action.      We look
forward to working with you.

                Sincerely,




The Honorable Anna G. Eshoo
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
