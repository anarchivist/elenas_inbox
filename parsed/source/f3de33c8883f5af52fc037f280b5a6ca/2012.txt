TEXT:
He says Rep. Stenholm is reaching the boiling point and will not be able
to avoid publicly criticizing us for much longer now that GOP members of
the Texas delegation are doing so.

He says Rep. Sam Johnson plans to raise the issue when the technicals bill
is on the floor of the House and may pursue attaching legislation to the
supplemental appropriations bill or introducing a separate bill.  Stenholm
would be compelled to co-sponsor these efforts.  Ed thinks Johnson could
be disuaded from doing this if he could have a face to face meeting with
Bowles.

Also, he said if we wanted to quietly float something with the governor
that he could have Stenholm call him directly.
