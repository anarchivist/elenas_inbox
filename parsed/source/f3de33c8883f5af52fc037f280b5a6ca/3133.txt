TEXT:
Elena:

I sent over a fax with a memo from L.D. Acheson to the AG detailing the
blow-up with Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton last week.  Here are the major
points in the current debate:

1. Rep. Norton does not want to abolish parole in DC and rejects the
criminal justice provisions/conditions in the DC MOU.

2. Consistent with the DC MOU, Justice wants the DC Plan legislation to
include "truth-in-sentencing" (abolition of parole for felons, imposition
of determinate sentencing with supervised released and good time credits
of up to 15%) and mandatory minimums for certain drug offenses. As I
mentioned, not only is "truth-in-sentencing" consistent with the federal
prison system -- we've tried to replicate it through the state prison
grants authorized in the crime bill.  As for the drug mandatories, I
understand that Eric Holder has advocated for them as a result of the 40%
drop in DC Drug Court participants since drug mandatories were repealed.

3. DOJ is willing to give on its conditions that DC's sentencing scheme
mirror federal sentencing for comparable crimes -- thUS, allowing DC to
determine its own sentencing.

4. Chuck Ruff has offered to help broker a compromise, but was asked by
Micheal Deich of OMB and DOJ to make sure that he touched base with DPC
and Rahm.
