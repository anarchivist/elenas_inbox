TEXT:
Well, folks, here we go again.  Sen. Kennedy just called to let us know
that he has to go to a funeral in Boston this evening, so we have to
postpone the tobacco meeting with Conrad has to be postponed.  I know that
he would still like to do it this week.  The VP is out of town on Thursday
and Friday, so we'll check the schedule for Tues and Wed. and let you
know.  -- Kay
