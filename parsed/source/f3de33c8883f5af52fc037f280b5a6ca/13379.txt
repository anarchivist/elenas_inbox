TEXT:
o The draft language you received from me yesterday is the House's
attempt to arrive at a common draft with the Senate; there is now
additional language from the Senate on lockbox, which is similar
to the language you have, but would also apply the cap reductions
to the out years.
o Domenici's staff tells me that the reason the cancellation
message is to be sent up the same day a bill is enacted is to deal
w/ the concern that tax provisions which are going to be canceled
should be canceled immediately; however, they are willing to


 examine reducing the reporting requirements in order to make this
 more logistically feasible.   I will circulate a list of all the
 reporting requirements so we can develop a pared down list.
 o The non-severability provision was included because Stevens
 believes that if the item veto does not apply to tax provisions
 and entitlements. 'it should not apply to direct spending.
 As I receive comments from you this morning. I'll encorporate them
 into the comment document and will recirculate a revised document
 this afternoon.
