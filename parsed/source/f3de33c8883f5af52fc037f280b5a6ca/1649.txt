MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  BRUCE REED
                       MIKE COHEN

SUBJECT:               UPDATE ON SELECTED EDUCATION INITIATIVES

This memo provides you with a detailed update on your national standards and testing initiative,
and more brief updates on several additional education initiatives.

1. NATIONAL STANDARDS AND TESTS: Our objective is to have 40+ states participate
in the initial 1999 administration of the national tests. To reach this objective, we are working
on several interrelated fronts:

Developing the Tests: By the end of April, the Education Department will release a Request for
Proposals (RFP) for the development of the 4th grade reading and 8th grade math tests. A draft
is already circulating for public comment. Contracts will be awarded by September 1. At this
time, it is not known whether each test will be developed by a separate contractor, or whether one
test developer will successfully bid to develop both. In addition, the Education Deparment and
the test developers will establish a number of technical advisory groups and evaluation panels to
assure the technical quality of the tests.

As part of the process of developing the RFP, the Education Department has held a number of
public meetings with testing experts, states testing officials, and test publishers and others in the
education and civil rights communities. (The Education Department has made the transcripts of
these meetings, and other related documents, widely available on the Internet.) These sessions
have raised a number of important issues which will be addressed as the work proceeds. In
particular, virtually all groups have stressed the importance of ensuring the technical quality of
the tests, and that there be adequate attention to helping parents and the public understand the
nature and purposes of the tests. This is partic1urly important in light of experiences in a number
of states in which technical problems or public misunderstandings have led to strong controversy
about the testing program. Many urged that the timeline be slowed down if necessary, in order
to accomodate these concerns, although the Education Department continues to believe that the
timeline is realistic and appropriate. We agree, and see no reason now to delay the Spring 1999
date for the initial test administration.

Second, a number of states anticipate a challenge in integrating these new tests into their ongoing
testing programs, especially states that are now well along in developing new tests aligned with
recently developed state standards. Some states would therefore find it easier to "embed" a
small number of additional test items into their existing tests, rather than administer a separate
and additional test. However, this approach has been considered and does not appear to be
technically feasible if we are to have a valid test.
                                                               Hex-Dump Conve:siOil .

Third, many testing experts suggested that the 8th grade math test be based on the NAEP
framework rather than on the TIMSS framework. They argued that the NAEP framework is
more explicit and more widely accepted among the states, and that student scores could then be
reported according to the NAEP achievement levels (basic, proficient and advanced) as will be
the case with the reading test. The Education Department has determined that this would be a
preferable approach. They have also determined that it will still be possible to provide
individual student scores in terms of the TIMSS international scores as well, because of the very
high overlap in the content ofNAEP and TIMSS. Therefore, the final test will still meet your
initial committment of providing students with internationally competitive scores.

Creating a Political Buffer -- Ensuring the Tests are National and not Federal:
We are working to determine how best to establish an advisory or governing body that can
provide bipartsian support for this effort, provide assurance that the tests measure what they are
supposed to based on the widely accepted NAEP frameworks and do not measure some
federally-determined, politically correct knowledge, skills or attitudes. Mike Cohen, Mike
Smith and other Education Department officials have been consulting with Governors of both
parties, Congressional staff and others, with the aim of establishing an advisory mechanism that
will gamer strong biparisan support among Governors and in the Congress. Secretary Riley met
last week with Gov. Thompson, and is working to set up a meeting in mid-May. While the
additional consultations we will be undertaking may change our thinking significantly, our
current plan is as follows:
·       Create an interim advisory council as soon as possible, in consultation with governors and
        members of congress on a bipartisan basis. We would probably appoint governors,
        business leaders, and educators currently serving on related groups such as the National
        Education Goals Panel, ACHIEVE (the group established to follow-up last year's
        education summit in Palisades), and the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB),
        as well as others. The announcement of this council would be an opportunity to
        demonstrate bipartisan support for the testing initiative.

·      Especially with this council established, we think it may be possible to gain NGA's
       endorsement for the testing initiative at the Summer meeting in Nevada. Both the
       ACHIEVE Board of Directors and the National Education Goals Panel will be meeting in
       conjunction with the NGA meeting. If your schedule permits, it would be possible for
       you to meet with both groups, to demonstrate broad support for your standards initiative,
       and to help reenergize governors and business leaders behind common educational goals.

·      These two steps would create a favorable climate for Congressional consideration of
       legislation to reauthorize the National Assessment of Education Progress and the National
       Assessment Governing Board, which are scheduled for consideration sometime in this
       Congress. At that time, we can determine ifNAGB should assume policy responsibility
       for the national tests, with Congressional support. (At present, NAGB is prohibited by
       law from overseeing the development of individual-level tests.) They would also
       strengthen our hand, with key bipartisan support, if there are efforts in the appropriations
       process this Fall to prohibit the Education Department from funding the development of
       national tests.
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

Building Momentum through state and local endorsements: We are continuing to try and
identify additional states to sign up for the testing initiative, though do not yet have any
additional finn committments. We believe that the consultation process with governors
described above will yield additional states. We are also working with a number of chief state
school officers. At present, we hope over the next 3-4 weeks to line up a handful of states for a
White House event. We are also working to identify states that would be likely to sign up when
you resume your travel schedule.

We are also beginning to develop a strategy for signing up big cities, such as Los Angeles and
Boston, regardless of the respective state participation. The intent here is to further demonstrate
momentum, to underscore that these standards are especially important for the students and
schools for which society has low expectations, and to demonstrate that these tests can in fact be
tools to lift people up, by helping to stimulate new and focus existing partnerships and efforts to
improve teaching and learning.

Working with the Education Department, we believe it will be possible, over the next several
months, to work with mayors, school superintendents and school boards, teachers unions,
institutions of higher education, as well as parent, community and business groups in 6-9 cities.
We would seek broad partnerships in each city that would pledge to benchmark their success by
using the national tests, and commit to specific, locally designed efforts in each community to
help prepare students to meet these standards. We will ask the Education Department to
develop a plan for working with these cities, to provide them with infonnation on proven
practices, and to help the cities learn from each other.


2. CHARTER SCHOOLS
One of our key goals is to foster the creation of 3,000 charter schools within 5 years, up from the
current level of 500. One challenge is expanding the number of states with charter schools
legislation. Currently 25 states and DC authorize the creation of charter schools; we would like
to raise the number of states to 30 by the end of 1997. Over the past couple of months, progress
in state legislatures has been slow, due in part to an absence of strong centrist leadership at the
state level, partisan differences, and occassional opposition by state and local union affiliates. In
addition, in at least one state (Virginia) the potential racial impact of charter schools emerged as
an issue.

However, there are some bright spots. In Washington State this week the governor, schools
superintendent and legislators have tentatively reached agreement on a charter schools bill, with a
vote in the state House scheduled for Friday. Mississippi is also on the verge of passing a
charter law, although the number of schools authorized would be fairly limited. Charter
legislation is also alive in Missouri (as part ofa big post-desegregation package), Indiana, and
Nevada.

There are several steps that we believe can help move things forward in some of these state·s.
Visible Presidential leadership in the near future, in the form of an address to a legislature on
                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dilmp Conversioil

    charter schools, a radio address, or other similar event, will lend support to charter schools
    advocates.

    Second, the Education Department is ready to release two important reports on charter schools.
    One is the first year report of a major national charter school study. A key finding is that the
    number one obstacle for new charter schools to overcome is lack of access to start-up funding.
    A second is a guidebook for school boards and other chartering authorities, which emphasizes the
    importance of effective accountablity for charter schools. The Education Department is also
    planning a national charter schools conference in late Summer or early Fall. . These activities
    will provide support both to state efforts and to your request for $100 million for charter schools.



    3. TALENTED TEACHERS IN EVERY CLASSROOM
    (/ still need to edit this one)
    Within the next couple of weeks, the Department will be ready to disseminate the first part of its
    response to your directive on improving teaching, a user's guide on how the Department's
    resources can support state and local efforts to support high-quality teaching. A second part of
    its response, a document identifying promising practices in teacher recruitment, preparation,
    certification, and retention, as well as for removing incompetent teachers, is currently being
    prepared by the Department, and should be completed near the end of the month.

    Later this month, in conjunction with the Annual Teacher of the Year event on April 18, the
    Department will host a conference on strategies for improving teacher recruitment and
    preparation. The conference will include all the state teachers of the year, university presidents,
    and deans of education schools, as well as student teachers. One function of the conference will
    be to provide input into the Department's proposal for strengthening the
    teacher-preparation-related provisions in Title V of the Higher Education Act.

    As you will recall, your budget proposal calls for a significant increase in support for the
    National Board for Professional Teacher Certification to move towards the goal of
    Board-certifying 100,000 teachers. A new crop of Board-certified teachers was recently named,
    and (although it isn't public yet), the new national teacher of the year is a Natonal-Board certified
    teacher from an urban area.
