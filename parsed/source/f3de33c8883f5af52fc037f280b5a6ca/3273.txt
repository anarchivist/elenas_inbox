TEXT:
From 7/3/97 briefing:

Q    A domestic question, Mike.  In New York, ACORN is
trying to organize workfare participants that attempted to deliver
petition signatures on Mayor Giuliani, who bumped the question to
Washington, saying that's where the complaining should be done. Does
the White House have a feeling about organizing former welfare
recipients who are now working for --

              MR. MCCURRY: We think they should be allowed to enjoy
the protections of labor law and most particularly should be paid a
m1n1mum wage. That's why the President strongly objects to some of
the discussion in Congress about not paying workfare participants the
minimum wage to which they're entitled -- while we will continue to
press the case that we need to honor those who are making that
transition from welfare to work by ensuring that it pays them to go
to work and assuring that they have a liveable wage that they can
endure on.

             Q    But in terms of organizing for other benefits,
which is what these folks are after? They're after health care
benefits and other things.

             MR. MCCURRY: We well understand the desire of people
who are working to come together and try to advocate for the best
benefits that they can get, and that's an acceptable part of our
collective bargaining process under national labor law. We think
that workers participating in workfare experiments should be able to
negotiate for the kind of protections that other workers enjoy in the
marketplace.
