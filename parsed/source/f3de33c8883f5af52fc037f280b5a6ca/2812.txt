                         "CLONING PROHIBITION ACT OF 1997"

                                         FACT SHEET


The President today transmitted to the Congress the "Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997". This
legislative proposal would implement the key recommendation of the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission for legislation to prohibit any attempt to create a human being using
somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.

The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) Report

President Clinton today accepted the NBAC's report on the possible cloning of human
beings and acted on the report's recommendations. In February, following reports of the
successful cloning of a sheep, the President asked the NBAC to review the profound ethical issues
raised by the possible cloning of human beings. Today, Dr. Harold Shapiro, Chair of the
Commission and President of Princeton University, formally presented the report to the President.

The Commission found unanimously that at this time it is morally unacceptable for anyone
to attempt to create a child with the technology used to created Dolly the sheep. The
NBAC reported that attempting to create a child using so-called somatic cell nuclear transfer
cloning would pose great risks to the child, and that ethical issues need further discussion. The
NBAC called for a moratorium on the use of the technique in humans.

The Commission also found that the new technology may have many agricultural and
medical benefits, including the development of medicines, therapies for diseases such as cancer,
cystic fibrosis, and diabetes, and prospects for repair and regeneration of human tissues. The
NBAC concluded that the cloning of DNA, cells, tissues, and non-human animals -- using
somatic cell nuclear transfer and other cloning techniques -- is not ethically problematic and is
governed adequately by existing regulations and guidelines.

Cloning Prohibition Act of 1997

Acting on the Commission's key recommendation, President Clinton announced legislation
banning the use of the new technology to clone human beings. Consistent with the NBAC's
recommendation, the President's legislative proposal prohibits [for five years?) the use of
somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human being and directs the NBAC to report to the
President in four and a half years on whether to continue the ban. The proposal is carefully
worded to ensure that it will not interfere with beneficial biomedical and agricultural activities.

Further Actions By The President

As recommended by the NBAC, President Clinton today also:

·      Reaffirmed that no Federal funds will be used to clone human beings. The President
       stated that the prohibition he put in place in March will remain in effect.
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
    ·   Urged privately funded scientists and clinicians to adhere to the voluntary
        moratorium he called for in March. Since these groups will not face legal restrictions
        on cloning until the President's legislative proposal is enacted, the President asked these
        professionals to work through their societies and associations to ensure that all adhere to
        the current voluntary ban.

    ·   Pledged to work with other countries to enforce the prohibition. Several other
        countries, including Great Britain, Denmark, Germany, Australia, and Spain, have banned
        human cloning.
