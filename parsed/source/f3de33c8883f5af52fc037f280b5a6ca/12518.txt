H.R. 1664 - Kosovo and Southwest Asia Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, FY 1999
                             (Sponsor: Young (R), Florida)

This Statement of Administration Policy provides the Administration's views on H.R. 1664, the
bilJ making emergency supplemental appropriations for military operations, refugee relief, and
humanitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo, and for military operations in
Southwest Asia. The Administration appreciates the Committee's prompt action on the
President's supplemental request and looks forward to working with the Congress on a
bi-partisan basis on this important legislation.

On April 19th , the President submitted to Congress a request for $6.05 billion for the Department
of Defense, the Department of State, and other international programs to provide the funds
necessary to cover the costs of the military and humanitarian operations related to the crisis in
Kosovo. Also included were funding requests to cover costs associated with on-going,
enhanced operations in Southwest Asia.

       The Administration's package:

        L      Protects the military readiness of those forces in the Balkan theater and alJ other
               U.S. forces;

        2.     Ensures our military has the fulJ measure of resources necessary to carry out the
               Kosovo air campaign; and,

       3.      Funds the U.S. commitment to provide humanitarian relief now and respond to
                  potential future refugee assistance needs.

The fact that we are asking the Congress for funding to respond to emergency needs in Kosovo
does not in any way diminish the importance of an emergency that is very close to home. The
Central American emergency relief package remains urgent [and should be approved without
offsets]. Every day we delay means another day the people of Central America lose hope in
their ability to rebuild their homes, earn their livelihood, and achieve a prosperous future in their
homeland.        In addition, the FY 1999 supplemental request for $100 million in assistance for
Jordan is critical to stabilizing the Jordanian economy, ensuring a smooth transition of leadership
and promoting the goal of peace in the Middle East that we all share. Also of critical
importance is our request for emergency agricultural relief to our farmers [without offsets].
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

The

Administration urges the Congress to avoid confrontation by acting quickly to enact these
requests without extraneous riders and spending.

Regrettably, the Committee-reported bill, which totals nearly $13 billion, goes well beyond the
funding requirements of the mission in Kosovo and the need to maintain current readiness. It
includes funding of over $1 billion for military construction projects, most of which may not
begin construction for several years and many of which are not even included in the
Department's long range plan. It includes significant increases for operation and maintenance
programs that have been budgeted for in the FY 2000 Budget and should be considered during
the FY 2000 appropriations process, not in an emergency supplemental bill.

We continue to believe that the Administration request is the appropriate level of funding and we
continue to urge the Congress to provide funding at that level. We support the Obey
amendment made in order in the rule to reduce the amount of unrequested, non-emergency
defense funding in the bill and to provide the urgent Central America, Jordan and agricultural
relief funding discussed above.

The Administration would strongly oppose a Coburn amendment made in order in the rule that
would impose a 10% across the board cut on most non-defense programs in FY 2000. This
irresponsible and unworkable amendment would result in cuts of at least $1,543.1 million for
Nlli; $357 million for VA medical care (the Department of Veterans Affairs could not expand
out-of-network emergency care benefits to disabled veterans enrolled in the medical care system,
and 13,188 veterans would not receive treatment); $273 million for FBI (resulting in an estimated
reduction of 2,200 FBI agents); $171 million for INS (resulting in a reduction of approximately
1,100 border patrol agents); $527 million for special education; $466 million for Headstart
(resulting in 50,000 fewer children served); $761 million less for Pell Grants (resulting in a
reduction of$250 in the maximum grant award); and $50 million from Safe and Drug-free
Schools.

Such a sequester would also reduce the funding available to FEMA and the Small Business
Administration to respond to natural disasters such as the recent tornados in Oklahoma, as well
as resources for embassy security, rural development, the Coast Guard, air traffic controllers,
low-income housing, operating our national parks, refugee assistance and the cleanup of
Superfund sites. To the extent that Congress approves FY 2000 appropriations that are below
the FY 1999 level, the impact of these cuts could be significantly deeper.

[With regard to the Latham amendment, a number of the proposed offsets are objectionable and
unnecessary given the emergency nature of the agricultural relief requirements.]

Despite months of allied diplomatic efforts to achieve a balanced peace plan, the government of
Slobodan Milosevic defied the international community and pursued a course of repression and
                                                                          Hex-Dump ConversIon

terror against the people of Kosovo. We determined that we could not allow these actions to go
unchallenged. Now, we have a responsibility to our country and to the men and women
serving our country in the Balkans and to address the humanitarian crisis provoked bv the
Milosevic government. The Administration has provided you with our best estimate of the
resources required to achieve our goals in Kosovo. Now is not the time to slow progress on
our emergency supplemental request by adding funding unrelated to the mission or to
maintaining current readiness or by adding extraneous provisions.

As the President stated on April 28'\ "My request fully funds our military and humanitarian
needs in Kosovo. Congress should resist the temptation to add unrelated expenditures, even
important ones, which could delay the process, because that would undermine the very goals that
this funding is intended to meet."   We ask the Congress to act quickly upon this request and
send a clear message to Milosevic - his actions will not be tolerated and we are prepared to back
our words with action.
