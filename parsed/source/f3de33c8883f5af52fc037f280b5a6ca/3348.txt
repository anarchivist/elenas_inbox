TEXT:
There is no time on the schedule for another child health event in July so
Ann and Stephanie suggested combing pediatric labeling with the
immunization event on the 23rd.  I expressed the differences in the
message, but they want it to be combined with this event or have a
surrogate do it. We may have a better chance in August, but it won't be
as certain as doing it with immunization on the 23rd.
