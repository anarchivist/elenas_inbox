TEXT:
FYI: The 3d Circuit case was NOT a challenge to the federal Megan's Law,
but to the New Jersey state law which bears the same name. The challenge
to the NJ law dealt with the provisions requiring the application of
community notification to offenders who were convicted before the law was
enacted. The federal Megan's Law is, for the most part, applied
prospectively.
