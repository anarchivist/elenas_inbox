TEXT:
Mary Bourdette got a call from Jim Sourwine (Sen Specter) saying that Sen.
Specter wants to offer a narrow version of legislative language re:
domestic violence in Labor-HHS. Mary explained all the reasons why we do
not want new legislative language at this time, but is not sure she
persuaded him. Even if he offers something, neither Murray nor the House
Republicans will probably go along ...

Bruce, any word from the Senator?
