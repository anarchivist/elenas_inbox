TEXT:
Elena,
Martha, Broderick and I spoke with Ellen Vargyas from the EEOC reo the
Monday meetings.  Because Fawell's staffer (apparently empowered to speak
for the authorizers, appropriators and Gingrich) has agreed that no "no
tester" language will be added during the subcommittee mark-up (b/c EEOC
has been working with them in good faith on a possible letter), Ellen does
not think that we should try to meet with the staffer in advance of the
subcommittee mark-up.  Martha and Broderick agree, but want to confirm that
 there is a deal on not including any language at this stage. Martha has
put in a call to Livingston's COS to confirm.  She has also put in a call
to Dixon to try to stave off a Monday morning "Dear Collegue" letter from
the CBC and to set up our other meetings.

Thus, instead of our going to see Fawell's staffer first, Ellen will come
here (at 12 noon) to give us all a better sense of her conversations with
Fawell's staffer. Martha and Broderick are setting up staff and Member
briefings for the afternoon, as we discussed.

Julie
