TEXT:
I understand that there is a message meeting today at 4pm in the Roosevelt
Room. As of right now the only message day open in next Wednesday, Feb.
3rd.  I believe that we are pushing for the Gun Shows Report.   However, I
have also heard that Doug and Gene are pushing for POTUS to address the
AARP Legislative Conference on that day.

The other thing out there is the drug strategy release, that ONDCP has
requested happen on Feb. 8.   Since we can't do it on the 8th due to the
Central America event, I think we wanted to try to make it a secondary
event the week before ... maybe Friday, Feb. 5th in the afternoon.

 I will make sure you both have info. on both the Gun Shows and Drug
Strategy event.  Please let me know if you need more info. from me.

Thanks!
