TEXT:

We have tentatively scheduled a conference call with     HHS to brief the White
House and OMB on their progress in responding to the     President's EO on adoption
and foster care for this Thursday at 5pm.
Please call if you have a conflict and want to be on     the call.   We will notify
you with the conference call phone number.
The final HHS adoption report is due Feb. 14, and we     plan to schedule meetings
for next week to have substantive discussions of the     content of the report so
that there will be a draft report by Feb. 1.
