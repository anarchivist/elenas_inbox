TEXT:
Loretta, the new Director of the Communications Office, would like to meet
with you in order to go over some needs you might have to help enhance
policy/message amplification.  She is very interested in working closely
with you during the final years of the Administration, and promoting our
goals and accomplishments.

Please let me know what time over the next day or two would be convenient
for you.

Thanks!
