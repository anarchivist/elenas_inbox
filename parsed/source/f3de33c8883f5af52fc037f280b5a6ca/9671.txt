Her call was just a heads up that they're sending over the TANF rule, and
she'd like to come brief us on it in the next 2 weeks, in hopes that we
can agree on our objectives before our staffs start fighting over the
details. That's fine by me, since our objective is to have them
capitulate to us on the details.
