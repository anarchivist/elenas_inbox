Re Karen's attached note, I will get a Q&A in on FICA/workfare by cob
tomorrow, after running it by Elena.  Karen says that the VP is very
likely to get a question from McEntee along the lines of, "Are you really
planning to sell us out with a Treasury ruling that exempts workfare
positions from FICA taxes?"

Subject:         briefing book for afl-cio

        you probably already heard from staff secretary about the briefing
book -- we are going to use it both for the potus and vp --- the only hot
issue that i know will be raised will be the fica/futa --- you may know of
others.

        also, the vpotus may be doing a round table on friday (late) in
los angels with the executive board of the california teachers --- they
want to talk about charter schools and california technology partnership
-- any thoughts/ideas would be helpful
