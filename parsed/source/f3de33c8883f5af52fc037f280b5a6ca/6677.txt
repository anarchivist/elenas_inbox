       Crime -- School Safety     Next week, the Department of Education and the
       National Center on Education Statistics will release a survey on school
       safety entitled, "Violence and Discipline Problems in U.S. Public Schools:
       1997-97." The findings of this survey are based on a nationally
       representative sample of 1,234 public elementary, middle, and secondary
       schools and include:                                                    .

       - More than half, or 57%, of public schools reported experiencing at least
       one crime incident in the 1996-97 school year that was reported to law
       enforcement officials, and 1 in 10 schools reported at least one serious
       violent crime during that year (i.e., murder, rape, other sexual battery,
       suicide, physical attack or fight with a weapon, or robbery) .

       - Overall incidents of crime and violence include: 190,000 physical
       attacks or fights without a weapon; 116,000 thefts or larceny; 98,000
       incidents of vandalism; 11,000 physical attacks or fights in which a
       weapon was used; 7,000 robberies; and 4,000 rapes or other forms of sexual
       battery.

       - 43% of schools reported no incidents of crime; 37% reported 1 to 5
       crimes; and 20% reported 6 crimes or more.

       - Middle and High Schools were more likely to experience an incident of
       crime and violence than elementary schools   (74% and 77%, as opposed to
       45% for all violent incidents; 19% and 21%, as opposed to 4% for serious
       violent crimes). Differences in robbery rates were not significant.

       - Schools that reported discipline problems were more likely to have
       experienced an incident of crime or violence, and were more likely to
       experience serious violent crime than those with less serious discipline
       problems.

       - Most public schools -- 79% to 94% -- reported having "zero tolerance"
       policies on violence, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, weapons other than
       firearms, and firearms.

       - Most schools -- or 84% -- employed only low levels of security to
       prevent violence (closed campuses, sign-in policies, or other measures to
       control access).  10% had moderate security (part- or full-time guard
       with restricted access to school, or metal detectors with no guards), and


only 2% had stringent security (police or full-time guards and daily or
random metal detector checks).  3% of schools reported that none of the
security measures asked about in survey were used.

- Most schools -- or 78% -- have some type of violence prevention or
reduction program, and half the schools. And half the schools with
violence prevention programs involve all or nearly all the students.
