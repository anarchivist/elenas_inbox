 Dorskind's office is pushing for us to get them an updated draft as soon

Thank you for your message regarding tobacco products.

Tobacco use is a common but deadly habit. Each year, more than 400,000 Americans die
prematurely from tobacco-related illness. Most started smoking as children.

We must work hard to reduce the number of children who become addicted to tobacco products
and have their lives cut short as a result. Even though it is illegal in every state for youth to
smoke, some 3,000 boys and girls take up smoking every day. Among smokers ages 12 to 17,
70 percent already regret their decision to smoke and two-thirds say they want to quit.

That is why last August I announced a tough new FDA regulation limiting minors' access to
tobacco and curbing the promotion and advertising that enhance the appeal oftobacco products
to young people. In February, I was proud to announce that the first parts of the regulation went
into effect. From now on, no one under age 18 may buy tobacco products, and retailers must
check photo IDs for anyone under the age of 27 who wishes to purchase tobacco products.

The tobacco industry has opposed the FDA rule in the courts. In an historic step forward for
public health, a Federal District Court held in April that the FDA can regulate
nicotine-containing tobacco products, and that the provisions I announced in February will
remain in effect.
I was disappointed, however, that the court overturned provisions in the FDA rule designed to
prevent tobacco companies from marketing their products to children. These provisions would,
among other things, ban outdoor billboards within 1,000 feet of schools or playgrounds and
eliminate the use of images and colors that appeal to children in most advertising. Government
lawyers have appealed this part of the court's ruling. Overall, however, the court's decision was a
landmark and historic one for the nation's public health and for our children.

The recent settlement agreement proposed by the state attorneys general, the tobacco industry,
and others provides another potential opportunity to take a major step froward for the public
health. Congress would have to approve the agreement before it goes into effect. I have asked
my domestic policy advisor, Bruce Reed, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
Donna Shalala, to carefully review the agreement with Administration staff over the next several
weeks, to listen to public health experts, and to help me ensure that any agreement that goes
forward to Congress is in the best interest of the public health, especially the health of our
children.

Thank you for your comments ...
