 TEXT:
 Elena, I incorporated all of your comments, except for two. They are:

 1) you asked. whether the authorization for the legislation is 6 or 7
 years. The authorization is for 6 years, because we are now in the 2nd
 year of the program.
 2) You asked if we could include seven-year figures for $ and # of
 teachers.  How important is it to include these? I think we can include
 these, but there are a few possible reasons not to do this.

 First, the VP will be in Washington State Sunday, California Monday, and
 New York next Thursday, and they would LOVE to be able to release the
 7-year state-by-states on one of these trips.

 Second, it will take a bit of extra time to get and include the 7-year
 #s.   (We could do it in time for the Riley-Kennedy mtg with groups at 4pm,
 though we probably couldn't do this in time for a 1pm Brod has on the
 hill.   Brod would prefer to get these in time for his 1pm mtg, but 4pm
 would be OK with him as well.

Third, I am checking with Barbara Chow to make sure OMB is OK with
including 7-year #s.  I think we did include seven-year budget figures in
the FY2000 budget, but --because of likely changes in state allocations
over time -- OMB may be a little skittish about including the # of
teachers by state.

                              A NATIONAL EFFORT TO REDUCE CLASS SIZE:
                           SMALLER CLASSES WITH WELL-PREPARED TEACHERS
                                                 February 23, 1999


        AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIPARTISAN PROGRESS IN EDUCATION.                             Last year, President
        Clinton proposed a historic initiative to reduce class size in the early grades -- when children
        learn to read and get a solid foundation in the basics -- by hiring 100,000 well-prepared teachers
        over seven years. Congress enacted a down payment on this request last year with bipartisan
        support, providing a one-time $1.2 billion appropriation to help communities hire approximately
        30,000 teachers nationwide. This week, Congress has the opportunity to build on its bipartisan
        efforts to reduce class size and finish· the job by passing legislation authorizing this initiative for
        the next six years.

        SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE LOCAL PLANNING.                    Under the initiative enacted into law last
        year, school districts will begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to begin
        reducing class sizes this fall. While last year's one-year appropriation provided an important
        start on President Clinton's seven-year initiative, Congress has the chance to support effective
        local planning by giving school districts the confidence they need that funding will be available
        under this initiative for years to come. Rejecting this legislation this week will send a dangerous
        message to school districts about the prospects for continued funding just when they are
        beginning to make decisions about how to implement this new initiative.

        INCREASED FUNDING FOR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION.                            In this year's
        budget, President Clinton and Vice President Gore proposed $1.4 billion to hire a total 38,000
        teachers.

        ·              This initiative would provide [STATE] with [STATE ALLOCATION] to
                       support [NUMBER OF TEACHERS] to reduce class size in early grades across
                       .the state.


        SMALL CLASSES MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Studies show that smaller classes help teachers
        provide more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline; as a result
        students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. According to studies,
        students from smaller classes in North Carolina, Wisconsin, Indiana, Tennessee, and across the
        nation outperformed their peers in larger classes. Moreover, research shows that reduced class
        size makes the greatest difference for minority and disadvantaged students. For example, a
        national study of 10,000 4th graders and 10,000 8th graders found the greatest impact of smaller
        classes on inner-city youth.

SUPPORT FROM MAJOR EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS. Major education organizations
have said that the President's class size initiative is the kind of initiative that has the potential to
make a real difference in raising the academic achievement of young Americans. These
organizations include the American Association of School Administrators (MSA), the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT), the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the Council
of Great City Schools (CGCS), Federal Advocacy for California Education, the National
Association of Elementary School Principals (NAESP), the National Association of State Boards
of Education (NASBE), the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, the
Natio~al Education Association (NEA), the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA), the
National School Boards Association (NSBA), NAACP, the National Association of School
Psychologists, the International Reading Association (IRA), and the Executive Director of the
Council of Scientific Society Presidents.
