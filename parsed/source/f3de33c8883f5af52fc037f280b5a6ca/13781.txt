TEXT:
Elena,
I just wanted to touch base with you on HR 3586, Veterans
Employment Opportunities Act of 1996, since you indicated earlier
that you were interested in this bill.  If you are still
interested in it, I would suggest you talk with Al Maldon in WH
LA who is the lead on this matter.
Thanks.
