TEXT:
* I took a look at the WSJ food safety story -- I'm having a bit of a hard
time getting Levitt on the phone -- he's out today, I'll talk to Schultz.

* The Ford air bag thing looks promising, DOT will come over and give us
a briefing on the state of things.

* Along with Christa, we'll pull the names together in time for the
meeting.

I faxed over to you the two best FCC consumer ideas for SOTU I mentioned
previosuly, the second one is the more promising.
