                   President Clinton: Deterring and Reducing Gun Crime
                                      March 20, 1999

In weekly radio address, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney
General to develop a comprehensive firearms violence reduction strategy for the nation. Among
other things, the strategy will specifically include: the intensive investigation and prosecution of
gun criminals; expanded efforts to identify illegal gun markets and gun "hot spots"; and
improved coordination with state and local law enforcement and other community-based efforts.
The President will also release a new Justice Department report highlighting 60 promising
strategies that have helped reduce gun violence in communities throughout the country.

Stepping Up the Fight Against Gun Violence

Gun crimes down, but still too high. Since 1993, the nation's crime rate has dropped by more
than 20 percent, and to its lowest level in a generation. During this period gun-related crime has
dropped even more: gun murders are down by 33 percent, and crimes committed with firearms
are down by 27 percent. But gun-related crime and violence remain serious problems. In 1996,
more than 34,000 people died from gunfire -- about 14,000 of which were homicides. And the
youth gun murder rate remains especially high -- nearly twice what it was just 15 years ago.

Taking the fight against gun violence nationwide. To continue to reduce gun crime and
violence, President Clinton will direct the Secretary of the Treasury and Attorney General --
working with U.S. Attorneys, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), and all of
state and local law enforcement -- to develop a comprehensive national firearms strategy that
builds on the successful efforts already in place throughout the country. Specifically, the
President will ask that the strategy contain elements to:

       Prosecute more gun criminals by expanding efforts such as Project Exile in
       Richmond, VA. As part of Project Exile, U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey -- working
       closely with other state, local and federal law enforcement authorities -- targeted
       gun-carrying felons and other armed criminals for immediate federal prosecution and
       stiff mandatory sentences in federal prison. Fahey also reached out to the business
       community and launched an extensive media campaign to educate Richmond's residents
       about the lengthy, mandatory prison sentences associated with gun crimes. Gun-related
       homicides in Richmond fell by 41 percent after Project Exile was implemented.

       Target illegal gun markets and gun "hot spots" like the Boston Gun Project, where
       the Boston Police Department and ATF work together to disrupt illegal gun markets by
       investigating illegal gun trafficking and referring cases for swift prosecution by the
       federal and state prosecutors. Through the Gun Project, every gun recovered by the police
       in a crime is traced through ATF's National Tracing Center to uncover sources of illegal
       weapons and gun trafficking patterns. Combined with other youth violence prevention
       efforts, the Boston Gun Project has helped contribute to the 75 percent decline in youth
       homicides since 1995.
                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

       Strengthen enforcement of gun laws and regulations through programs like Oakland's
       Firearms Licenses Compliance Program. This joint effort by the Oakland Police
       Department and ATF ensures that prospective applicants for federal firearms licenses are
       subject to a complete and comprehensive background investigation. It also improves
       gun dealer compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws -- including local
       ordinances that prohibit gun dealers from operating in residential neighborhoods. The
       Oakland program has been credited with helping to reduce the overall number of gun
       dealers from 57 to 6 between 1994 to 1996.

       Enhance supervision of gun criminals as is done by the Minnesota Anti-Violence
       Initiative (MAVI). Under MAVI, Minneapolis probation and police officers work
       together to closely monitor gang and gun criminals by making unannounced home visits
       to probationers at night to make sure they are sticking to the terms of their probation
       sentence. MA VI is credited with helping Minneapolis reduce its summertime homicides
       from 40 in 1996 to just 8 in 1997.

       Promote innovative local strategies like the st. Louis Firearms Suppression Program
       (FSP) in Missouri. In response to a tripling of the number of juvenile homicide
       suspects, FSP was formed to get guns out of the hands of juveniles. Police officers
       approached parents in high-crime neighborhoods and asked for their consent to
       search for and seize illegal guns in their household. If parents agreed to the search,
       no one in the residence would be charged with a crime if illegal guns turned up.
       Between 1994 and 1997, FSP officers seized more than 1,300 guns.

To help communities learn more about these and other successful programs, the President will
release a new Justice Department report -- Promising Strategies to Reduce Gun Violence.
Designed as a "toolbox" for communities, the report details 60 successful strategies to reduce
gun violence that were reviewed and recommended by more than 40 national experts from a
range of disciplines. The report will be distributed to communities throughout the country.

New Resources for Firearms Enforcement

The President's FY 2000 budget includes new resources to help implement the national strategy
called for today. In particular, his budget includes:

       $5 million for more than 40 additional federal prosecutors to conduct intensive firearms
       prosecution projects targeting violent felons who possess guns, armed drug traffickers,
       and illegal gun markets;

       $23.8 million for more than 120 new ATF agents to support firearms investigations,
       arrest violent criminals and gun traffickers, and crack down on illegal gun sales

       $1.3 billion for a 21 st Century Policing Initiative to help communities hire more police
       and prosecutors, and to allow them to target gun crime and other public safety priorities.
