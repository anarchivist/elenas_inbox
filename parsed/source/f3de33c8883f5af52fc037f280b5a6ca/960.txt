TEXT:
Here's my quick insert for the Medicare issue we just talked about    CJ:

On Monday, the Treasury Department will release its monthly report on the
status of the Medicare Trust Fund.  It will show a seemingly significant
$9 billion drop in reserves.  This finding is not unexpected and the
current status of the Trust Fund is still almost exactly in line with
projections from the June, 1996 Trustees report. As such, this report
does not change the status of the actuary's projected exhaustion date of
2001. However, when a bad monthly report is released, some House
Republicans (like Archer and Thomas) use it as ammunition against us,
suggesting that we continue to ignore the Medicare "crisis." Our
response, as usual, is that this finding is not out-of-line with the
projections of last year's Trustees report, that fluctuations are normal
and expected, and that the Trust Fund still has more than $125 billion
left in reserves. We then go onto point out that we still need to take
prompt action to strengthen the Trust Fund, as we have advocated in three
successive balanced budget proposals.
