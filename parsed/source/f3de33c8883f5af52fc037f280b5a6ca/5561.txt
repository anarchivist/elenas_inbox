TEXT:
BR/EK:

Any thoughts on the proposed noon meeting w/Erskine and the General? I
spoke to DOJ and Treasury, both of whom have only met once with ONDCP on
this. They shared some high-spy and hopefully substantive notes that I'm
going to review tonight.  The only other thing I know is that McCaffrey
may want the President to call for a new and improved Border Strategy in
the Miami drug speech.

Jose'
