       REMOVING BARRIERS TO WORK FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES

The President's budget includes important steps to make it possible for more people with
disabilities to work. A large and growing number of people with disabilities can work, and want
to work. With the ADA, changes in societal attitudes, and advances in technology, it is clearer
than ever that being disabled does not mean that you can't contribute to our nation's economy.
However, people with disabilities face a variety of complex barriers to work.

Therefore, the President's budget addresses this critical problem with the following three
initiatives designed to assist people with disabilities who are eligible for Social Security
Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI):

·      New State Option on Medicaid: The budget proposes to help people with disabilities
       work without losing their health care coverage. Today, people on Supplemental Security
       Income (SSI) who go to work lose Medicaid iftheir earnings exceed caps that vary by
       state. Yet, it is often especially difficult for people with disabilities to get private
       insurance, especially coverage for any preexisting conditions. As a result, many people
       who are eligible for SSI "manage" their income to ensure that they keep Medicaid -- by
       stopping work when they hit the caps, or even turning down promotions. The
       President's proposal would create a new state option that would allow SSI beneficiaries
       with disabilities who earn more than these caps to keep Medicaid by contributing to the
       cost of their coverage as their income rises.

·      Medicare: The President's budget authorizes a four-year demonstration to encourage
       Social Security Disability Inusrance (SSDI) beneficiaries to return to work. Under the
       demonstration, certain SSDI beneficiaries who have exhausted their coverage [under a
      .trial work period and an extended period of eligibility] would be eligible for up to four
       additional years of premium-free Part A coverage.

·      Pay for Results for Rehabilitation Services: The Administration is proposing a new
       strategy to encourage more SSDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients to return to work.
        Currently, the Social Security Administration (SSA) refers some SSDI and SSI
       beneficiaries to State Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) agencies. Under this pilot
       proposal, SSDI and SSI beneficiaries could choose their own public or private VR
       providers. Providers who successfully assist beneficiaries in leaving the rolls and
       returning to work would be paid a percentage of the disability benefits saved.
       These payments would continue only as long as the person remained off the rolls, up
       to a maximum of five years. Because providers would be rewarded for results
       rather than for their costs, this should encourage more providers to have a
       continuing interest in their clients' long term success, which in turn may lead to
       more beneficiaries returning to work.

This plan creates new ways to help people find work and achieve their goals. The
Administration looks forward to working with the Hill to enact these proposals. Since there are
members of Congress from both sides of the aisle who are also working to solve this problem, we
                       Automated Records Management System
                       Hex-Dump Conversion


    are hopeful that we will have a constructive dialogue that will lead to the enactment of
    legislation.
