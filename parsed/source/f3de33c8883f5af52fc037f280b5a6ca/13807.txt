TEXT:
FYI.
Small point, but neither the WSJ nor the Post reported the
amendments on WH, files etc., in their coverage of the TPO subcom
mark-up the other day.  (I don't recall seeing any story in the
NY Times.)
This was because they covered the huge whack that the IRS took in
some depth.
(I think the possibility that 2000 workers would be laid off as a
result of that cut may have been dominating Steny's thoughts when
we met with him.)
Anyway, the lack of coverage (which does surprise me) may help
to contain slightly the enthusiasm for more mischief at full
committee. At least they were not rewarded for it by the press
coverage.
