TEXT:
Yes, good idea -- but keep it focused on immigrants.   Is that what
Giuliani wanted to meet on, or did he just want a mtg?

I find it amusing that our political operation is bending over backwards
to arrange a mtg for Giuliani in the midst of his re-election year, but
pitch a fit anytime we go near any state with a GOP governor.
