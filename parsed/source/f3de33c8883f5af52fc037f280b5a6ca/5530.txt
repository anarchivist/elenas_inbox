TEXT:
She was very hesitant to have one, saying that this proposal should be
considered in the context of what initiatives people want to pay for, and
that reviewed independently everyone would shoot it down.  I said that it
would be unfair to raise this only in the context of new initiatives
because people would see it simply as a pay for without knowing there are
policy objections.
I also said that even if we leave HHS of the loop, other people at the
White House need to know, so they can prepare their bosses for the budget
meetings, which she found difficult to argue against.

I think I'd like to send her a note, say we thought about it some more,
and that we think I really need at a minimum to talk to Emily Bromberg and
Emil Parker about it, whether or not we have a meeting.   Okay?
