TEXT:
Democratic staff are meeting at 5:00 to discuss a possible Democratic
first day tobacco bill. There's no decision to have one, but they've
decided to discuss whether there's enough agreement to put one together.

Tom Mahr/Conrad is thinking about a bill that would entail:

1) Price increase to be determined (would want to coordinate with us if
they decide to move ahead; he had heard we were in the 50-70 cent range
but didn't push me to comment)

2) FDA

3) Durbin lookbacks (not because they're realistic,      just because they had
a bipartisan vote on them)

4) Menu for 50% of state funds that is a) half tobacco control and b) half
McCain menu

5) General language authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to run an
assistance program for farmers.

I also heard from Waxman and Meehan staff today eager to coordinate as we
move forward.
