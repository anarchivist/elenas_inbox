TEXT:
Wanted to let you know that I ran into Hugh Price's WA Office director
 (Tom McAlpine) and asked him more questions regarding the Urban League
conference and what was happening on the day the President speaks.    I
also asked what was there conference theme.     Since we indicated in
yesterday's Sr. staff meeting that this wouldn't be billed as a race and
reconciliation (which is good)   I thought we needed to know there focus.
I recall someone mentioning the POTUS could speak about education.
That's great and it should be weaved into overall message.   Here is the
theme of the conference and the line up for that Monday.    THEME:
ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT: The Next civil Rights Frontier
