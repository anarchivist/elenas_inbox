TEXT:
I spoke with Ron Haskins this morning and confirmed a meeting time for
9:30 am on Friday in Room B-317 Rayburn. But there is some background you
should know. He is planning to have a meeting with the Legis. Assistants
(both Repubs. and Dems.) tomorrow at 10 AM to share with them some paper
laying out the options which the committee may likely consider as they
move to markup on welfare next week. So our meeting will likely not be
very long or substantive but could be helpful in communicating the
importance of bipartisanship and Administration input.   It does sound like
they want to move very quickly. He indicated that he would be in a
drafting session with Legislative Counsel as soon as 11:30AM tomorrow
morning.

If you think it is a problem to do the 9:30 meeting tommorrow morning
please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks. Janet.
