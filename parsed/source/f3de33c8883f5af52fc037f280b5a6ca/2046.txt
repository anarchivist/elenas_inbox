Have reviewed the revised crack statement.

ONDCP strongly believes the last sentence in the second paragraph is
unnecessarily inflammatory and could have unintended effects.

Agree with the addition in the third paragraph -- "An adjustment would
also reduce the disparate racial impact of the current sentencing.
scheme". Director McCaffrey feels strongly about this issue and we
believe this needs to be in the statement.

Recommend our earlier revision to paragraph four.
