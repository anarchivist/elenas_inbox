TEXT:
Elena and Cynthia--if I remember correctly, HHS was working on                    some regs
to address this issue of domestic violence and welfare to work                    but we had
no firm date for publication--shouldn't that still be our plan                    as we had
discussed a couple of months ago rather than pursue the Murray                    legislative
approach?

1.  VPOTUS is doing a welfare to work event today in 450 with Glickman,
Shalala and USAID, Duffy.

2.  The main focus of the meeting was a discussion on Senator Murray's
conversation with the White House over a proposed amendment (domestic
violence) to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill. Audrey and Robin you may
want to have a conversation with both Cynthia Rice and Elena. NOWLDF did
call Elena yesterday.   HHS and DPC were going to regroup this morning to
discuss what we're doing.
