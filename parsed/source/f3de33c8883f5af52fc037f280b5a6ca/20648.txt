Subject:         Thursday, 7/16, 5:15pm

John Koskinen would like to convene a meeting of all Administration staff
who are interested in the proposed "Year 2000 Disclosure Act," which the
President referred to yesterday in his speech on Y2K.  please join us
tomorrow at 5:15pm in OEOB 239 if you would like to discuss the initiative.

OMB circulated a draft of the legislation earlier this week and requested
that any specific comments be submitted by noon today.  John is reviewing
those comments this afternoon.  If you haven't yet provided input to OMB
and would still like to, please contact Ingrid Schroeder at 395-3883
asap.  If you haven't yet received the draft, please let me know by return
email, and I'll get one to you.

For tomorrow's meeting, if you need clearance into the OEOB, please
provide by return email your full name, DOB & SSN. Thank you.
