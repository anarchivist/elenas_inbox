TEXT:
I spoke briefly with Senator Breaux today and we should get a document
from his staff today cob. His effort has had the effect of moving the
Republicans into a posture of talking concessions.  I'll get the document
to you as soon as it comes. Republicans have scheduled a mark-up for May
1 in Commerce Committee.
