 Subject:         Q&A on jury's decision

 A Florida jury found today that R.J. Reynolds is not liable for the lung
 cancer death of life long smoker Jean O'Connor.   We may be asked how this
 decision affects our agenda or the tobacco negotiations. FDA will answer
 no comment. Below is a draft Q&A for McCurry for your review;

  Q.     What implications does the jury's decision have for the
, Administration's tobacco rule? The settlement talks?

 A.      We don't have any comment on the jury's ruling. It's not our
 issue. We're focused on putting protections in place to prevent our
 children from smoking.
