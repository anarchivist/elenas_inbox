TEXT:
Sure. Just got back from an HHS briefing with hill folks.   It was very
good. Carol Williams and I discussed a couple of areas over which we
differ -- those areas are becoming more narrow as the process moves
forward.  HHS should have a draft of the Feb. 14 paper by this Friday, at
which point we will comment.  Just let me know when you're free and we
can talk.
