              PRESIDENT CLINTON: FIGHTING JUVENILE CRIME AND DRUG USE

            "Now, we must work together to do more, to protect our children from the scourge of
            violent crime and especially from crimes committed by other young people. This is now my
            highest law enforcement priority. We must provide for more prosecutors and probation
            officers, tougher penalties, and also better gang prevention efforts, including after school
            programs, so that young people have something to say yes to and some way of staying out
            of trouble. "

                                                                     --President Clinton, October 9, 1997

     While overall crime rates have been declining, juvenile crime and drug use remains a serious problem,
      Juvenile gun murders have quadrupled, teenage drug use has risen, and youth gangs have spread to
     large cities and rural towns throughout America, In the State of the Union, the President again
     challenged Congress to confront this issue and pass his Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Strategy,
     Specifically, his strategy and budget call for:

     ·      Targeting Gangs and Violent Juveniles. To help state and local prosecutors crackdown on
            gang members and violent juveniles, the President has proposed $150 million to hire new
            prosecutors and expand anti-gang task forces; $60 million to establish juvenile gun and drug
            courts that ensure swift and certain punishment for youthful offenders; and tough new
            penalties and prosecutorial tools.

     ·      Cracking Down on Guns and Gun Traffickers. To keep violent juveniles from buying
            guns as adults, the President's strategy also proposes to ban violent juvenile from buying guns
            on their 21 st birthday. His strategy also increases penalties for selling handguns to juveniles
            and other offenses, and includes $28 million to expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction
            Initiative (YCGII) that helps local law enforcement trace illegal firearms to their source.

     ·      Keeping Kids In School, Off Drugs and Out of Trouble. To ensure that kids are
            supervised from 3 to 8 pm -- the time when most violent juvenile crimes are committed -- the
            President's strategy proposes $95 million for the Justice Department to help keep schools
            open later and to promote anti-truancy initiatives and curfews. The President's Child Care
            Initiative also quadruples funding for Department of Education-sponsored after school
            programs, and his Drug Strategy includes new funds for Safe and Drug-Free schools,

              Key Components of the President's Juvenile Crime Strategy in the FY 1999 Budget:

            Prosecutorial Initiatives                      --   $150 million
