TEXT:
Here are people who a reporter could talk with to learn more about how the
vouchers work and why they are good.  I have NOT alerted any of them so
they do not know about the budget increase. Let me know if I should.  I
also have NOT yet alerted HUD that we may do this -- let me know once you
decide and I can call Jacqui Lawing.

The Center, APHSA, National Association of Housing and Redevelopment
Officials, and Council on Large Public Housing Authoritities put out a
joint letter explaining the opportunity presented with the current year
vouchers (I'm faxing to 6-2878).  Provides a good overview of the program.

Three places that are doing something similar: New Jersey (Roy Ziegler,
New Jersey Division of Housing and Community Resources 609-633-8084), CT,
and San Mateo County, CA (we have other contact info if needed, and the
Center has done fact sheets)
