Kay checked in with one more piece of news that I think settles the issue
on STate of the Union but creates an opportunity for you to maintain
public leadership on this issue. Here is her news, and my final
recommendation on the issue:

Per Smith, administration bill, carried by Leahy, Harkin, and Daschle,
will be introduced in this session that would require notification to USDA
of any discovery of tainted meat/poultry, authorize USDA to do recalls and
impose fines.  Missing piece of Sec. Glickman's desire to "Wait until
later." Therefore, based on what Jerry Mande had to say on past history
here, I recommend:

A. No SOTU announcement.
B. VP (with POTUS authorization if required) initiate work by NPR team
with existing agencies that have responsibliity to ensure food safety to
see if there are ways existing process can be made to work as a single
system, or as seamlessly as possible, while we await NAS study results.

OK? Disagree? Need further conversation?
