TEXT:
I spoke with Sandra Cook at Education and got the following report:

1. On the reading bill: Goodling announced at the outset that no testing
amendment would be offered, which quickly changed the dynamic of the
mark-up.

A Democratic amendment striking the Tutoring Assistance Grants was offered
but withdrawn, after getting an agreement from Republicans to work on
addressing concerns with this provision. (ED is to meet with GOP and D
staff on Monday on this) .

Dems won on an amendment to add a national evaluation and get rid of state
evaluations, although later agreed to a Riggs amendment to add back the
state evaluations.

With encouragement from ED staff, Dems held off on some additional
amendments that they were planning to offer, and agreed to support passage
of the bill, after it became clear that Goodling wanted to get the bill
out and wasn't going to be able to do so based on Republican votes.

Ultimately the bill was passed on voice vote.  Conservative Republicans
who would have been opposed to the bill made themselves scarce.

2. The Rules Committee will take up the charter bill tomorrow at 3 (it was
pulled today because of the Goodling mark-up)

3. Kildee, the ranking member on the postsecondary subcomittee, has agreed
to introduce our Title V teacher preparation proposal as a free-standing
bill; also, Roemer has indicated interest in sponsoring the bill.
Democratic staff is working to line up other members on the committee,
although this may be difficult because individual Dems have lots of ideas
about teacher preparation.
"
    Sen. Frist has introduced his bill on this -- which differs substantially
    from ours -- but had no original cosponsors.

    In general, her sense is that our proposal is being well-received.
