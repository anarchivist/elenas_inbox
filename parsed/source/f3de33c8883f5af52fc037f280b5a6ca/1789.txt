TEXT:
HHS/FDA staff are getting more nervous about the content we discussed --
just a general strategy (not legal) concern that the President shouldn't
be too tough on advertising and kids at this juncture. I talked to Bill
Corr and asked that they refrain from panic until they see a draft.  He
was o.k. with that. Please let me know when you have a draft and I'll get
it to HHS/FDA/Justice.
