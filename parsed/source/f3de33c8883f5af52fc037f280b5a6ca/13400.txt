TEXT:
I hope you received the fax now.   I faxed it again.    Thanks for letting me know.

I am also about to fax over a copy of the USDA letter on the Farm Bill which we
are in the process of clearing. You don't need to comment on the USDA letter, I
send it only to provide you with a context for understanding the
Administration's current position on the bill.
Let me know if you need a copy of HR 2854 in order to provide comment on the DOJ
letter. The bill is of course quite long, but I could easily e-mail it to you
if you don't have it.
Thanks
Alison
