                    States Push Fund for Tobacco Farms

                    By Mark R. Chellgren
                    Associated Press Writer
                    Monday, January 18, 1999; 5:14 p.m. EST

                    FRANKFORT, Ky.   (AP)   -- six tobacco-state governors are
united in
                  demands for a $5 billion cigarette-industry financed
trust fund for farmers.

                    In advance of negotiations this week with the companies,
the governors
                   issued a joint statement Monday that says a trust fund
is "the only viable
                   course of action to ensure the protection of our farmers
and their future.' ,

                    With demand for tobacco down sharply in u.S. markets and
a growing
                    public health attac.k on smoking, the governors are
anxious about the
                    prospects for farmers who long have depended on a
tobacco crop.

                   "We urge the companies to do the right thing by
establishing this $5.15
                   billion trust fund to compensate them for part of their
losses, " said the
                   statement by Govs. Jim Hunt of North Carolina, Paul Pa
tton of Kentucky,
                   Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Jim Hodges of South Carolina,
Roy Barnes of
                   Georgia and Don Sundquist of Tennessee.

                    The governors, attorneys general and agriculture


commissioners of
                     tobacco states are scheduled to meet with cigarette
company officials
                     Wednesday in Durham, N.C.

                     The negotiations grow out of the $206 billion agreement
by tobacco
                     companies to settle state lawsuits seeking reimbursement
for the cost of
                     treating smoking-related illnesses. That settlement also
required the
                  companies to meet with political leaders of tobacco
states to talk about
                  the concerns of the growers, who were not included in
the deal.

                     The first meeting was held a month ago.

                  Philip Morris, the industry leader, already has said it
will contribute $300
                  million to the trust fund this year. But the company
also said future
                  payments would depend on what is done by the other toba
cco companies
                  -- R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard.

                  Reynolds initially opposed creation of a trust fund,
saying a better way to
                  help farmers was to promise to buy more American-grown
tobacco.

                     Last week, the   u.s.   Department of Agriculture announced
that cigarette
                     makers plan to purchase 291 million pounds of burley
tobacco in 1999, a
                     31 percent drop from a year ago. And flue-cured tobacco
quotas are
                     down about 30 percent from two years ago.

                     The governors urged the companies to buy more tobacco,
but
                     acknowledged guaranteed purchases have serious legal
obstacles, such as
                     raising antitrust questions.

                  "The dramatic reduction in the intent to purchase
tobacco for the 1999
                  crop requires immediate and substantial action to avert
financial disaster as
                  the 1999 crop comes to market next year, " the statement
from the
                  governors said.

                     The national tobacco settlement has already produced
huge increases in
                     the price of cigarettes and is expected to further
depress demand for
                     farmers to continue their production.

                     But state and farm leaders acknowledge they don't have


the same legal
                  leverage to get concessions for farmers that states
negotiated with the
                  industry in seeking reimbursement for Medicaid and other
health costs.
