           Elana;

              I 'thought more about our conversation last night and decided that
  I
           did not make my arguments very well and that I was unconvinced by
  your
           sense that we must have one funding stream.  Naturally the Secretary
           and I will go along with a Presidential decision but my understand
           ing from our conversation is that we have a President's question,
           not a decision.  At the least it seems to me that the Secretary
           ought to have a shot at weighing in with the President if he be
           believes that a possible policy decision is misguided~  The following
           categorizes some of the arguments.  It is not clear to me that we
  need
           to make this decision now -- when it is made the Secretary needs to
  be
           involved! !

           1. Some basic facts about the 21st century program:

            * The grant recipients are a school or schools in
  COLLABORATION
           with other public and nonprofit agencies and organizations.

                *   A program could be run by a nonprofit organization (a Y
  etc. )
               in a sub-grant relationship with the schools.

                * The location for the program is a school building    -- a
  major
                purpose of the program is to leverage the use of the
  school
                building to a). use a valuable resource more efficiently: b)
  help
                develop the school as a community resource.

                * The cost savings in this approach are substantial -- we
           estimate a federal cost of $400/child per year. We ask for a match
  of
           1-1 and expect to obtain a lot more when things like the building are
           counted.  Other programs cost a number of times more.

                * One major focus of the 21st century schools programs is on
           educational activities -- this is not the case with the content of


        many other day care programs. The educational focus is greatly
        enhanced by the location of the services -- often libraries,
        materials, etc.

    ALL OF THIS ARGUES THAT THE SITE OF THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM IS
    CRITICAL -- THE ARGUMENT THAT SCHOOLS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN ADVERSE
    TO HOUSING AFTER-SCHOOL CARE IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN
    PUSHING THE 21ST CENTURY PROGRAM.  WE NEED A CLEAR STIMULUS TO
    OVERCOME THIS TENDENCY ON THE PART OF SOME SCHOOLS. The most
important
    part of this program is to stimulate far more school based programs
    than we will ever be able to afford.

        if WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE WE SIMPLY PLAY INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE THAT
        DO NOT WANT SCHOOLS TO BE A PART OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS.

        2. DEMAND: We expect 3-5 times as many proposals as we can fund this
        year and even more next year if the appropriation increases. Recent
        survey results indicate strongly that parents want their students in
        after-school programs in schools with learning activities.

        3. POLITICS: We have met with both the school groups and the
        community groups like CDF and they are comfortable with dual funding
        streams. During the child care debate some 10 years ago a one-stream
        funding mechanism was proposed and the schools and the community
        groups were at each others throats and sunk the proposals. We need
to
     learn from this and from the Am Reads experience -- where the
proposal
     to make community groups a fiscal agent was soundly rejected.

        A second political question revolves around vouchers     -- if we open
up
        the program to multiple bidders we are inviting a Republican move to
        turn it into a voucher program. THE SECRETARY FEELS VERY STRONGLY
        ABOUT THIS! ! ! ! !

        4.   CHILD CARE BLOCK GRANT:    HHS estimates that 1/3 of the block
grant
        will go to after-school care.     This is roughly 1.3 million.

        These block grant funds will increase supply by increasing demand! ! !

        THE BLOCK GRANT AND THE JUSTICE PROGRAM ALREADY CREATE SECOND FUNDING
        STREAMS! !

        5.  MECHANICS OF FUNDING: The notion of funding community groups by
        exception will be very difficult to make work -- To do it we woudl
        have to reserve funds for the community groups, go through the vari
ous
    proposals from schools and districts, make these funding decisions,
    look through for what districts were missing and then see if
community
    groups came in from the missing school districts.  This is possible
    but it does effectively require having two different funding streams
    and competitions.  If this is what the President wants to do perhaps
    we should specify a percentage set-aside.

        Regarding DC I think we can do this with a separate appropriation!!!
