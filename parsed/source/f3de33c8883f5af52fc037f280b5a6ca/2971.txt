TEXT:
FYI: the expectation is that Chafee and Rockefeller will offer their child
welfare bill tomorrow and will be supported by Jeffords, giving them
enough votes to pass.

The OMB letter to the Committee does not comment on this subject,    except
to comment on a possible pay for, as follows:



Cost Allocation Language -- The Administration understands that amendments
may be offered during Committee consideration, the purpose of which is to
prevent costs from increasing in Food Stamps and Medicaid due to
cost-shifting for common functions from the TANF block grant, which places
a cap on TANF administrative costs. We understand the CBO baseline
includes costs of over $5 billion in FYs 98-02 because CBO assumes
administrative costs shifting from TANF to Food Stamps and Medicaid.   This
proposal seeks to reduce the extent of the cost-shift to the Food Stamp
and Medicaid Programs, which could yield substantial savings against
CBOD,s baseline. While the Administration is generally supportive of this
effort -- to prevent States from changing cost allocation plans in order
to shift greater administrative costs from the capped TANF block grant to
the open-ended Food Stamp and Medicaid administrative costs that are
matched by the Federal government -- we would need to carefully review the
specific mechanism proposed.   In addition, we would have very serious
reservations about proposals that would cap Food stamps and Medicaid
administrative costs.

        The budget negotiators discussed changes to the Food Stamp and
Medicaid Programs at considerable length. An amendment reducing these
programs and directing savings to other programs was neither raised nor
included in the Budget Agreement.  The Administration has strong
reservations about such an approach.
