TEXT:
As you have probably noticed, the South Court exit from West Executive
Avenue has been out of service for several days.  The General Services
Administration technicians have been working around the clock to make it
operational again. As of early this afternoon, the necessary parts had
not been received.  Once the parts are available, the repairs should be
completed.

However, until the gate is operational, please continue to use the
Southwest Gate (the normal entry gate) to exit West Executive Avenue.

We will send you another message when the gate is operational.

Thank you for your cooperation.
