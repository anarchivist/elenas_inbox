STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

        I have today approved H.R. 2539, the ?ICC Termination Act of
1995.? I do so with disappointment because the bill falls far
short of my Administration?s proposal for a much bolder and more
complete sunset of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC).
Regulatory reform of the Nation?s transportation industries has
been an outstanding success. Beginning with air cargo
deregulation in 1977 and continuing with sweeping rail and
trucking reforms over the past 15 years, much of the stranglehold
of traditional government regulation has been broken. Today,
only about 20 percent of all domestic freight transportation is
regulated, compared with 75 percent 20 years ago.  These reforms
have reduced the cost of transportation of everything we buy and
use.  They have enabled U.S. producers and retailers to employ
?just in time? manufacturing and inventory systems to save many
billions of dollars in warehousing and distribution costs.
        Congress had an opportunity to build on this success but did


not take it. Instead, H.R. 2539 provides for only very modest
reform. While H.R. 2539 eliminates a number of obsolete and
unnecessary functions of the ICC, it maintains special
protections for transportation industries.   These protections are
no longer justified in today?s strong and competitive market
economy.
         For example, the Nation?s trucking industry has enjoyed
antitrust immunity for collective ratemaking for the last 47
years. Continuation of such authority will reduce potential
benefits to consumers and will protect inefficient carriers.

H.R. 2539 also maintains special merger standards for railroads.
The railroad industry has made a remarkable economic comeback
from hard times and no longer needs this special protection.
        My Administration strongly opposed earlier versions of this
legislation that would have weakened benefits for railroad
employees who are displaced by mergers and line abandonments.
I am pleased that the Congress changed the bill to address the
Administration?s objections.  I also note that the bill does
continue intact the important rail reforms of 1980 that have
helped improve rail service and bring the railroad industry back
to profitability.
        H.R. 2539 also provides for reducing some ICC functions,
including the overlap between similar DOT and ICC functions in
overseeing trucking industry safety and insurance requirements.
With the sunset of the ICC and the consolidation of motor carrier
functions at the Department of Transportation, the bill does
provide for modest budget savings.
        I have approved H.R. 2539 because of the preceding
beneficial provisions and to help provide a smooth transition now
that appropriations for the ICC have been terminated.
