TEXT:
Here is the scheduling request for the President to announce the award of
contracts to manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
detection devices for installation at airports throughout the United
States. While this is part of an ogoing effort to strengthen airport
security since the Gore Commission report came out in 1996, neither the WH
nor DOT has ever done an event on it.   Are you OK with submitting this?
Let me know, Mary

     FROM:                       Bruce Reed

     REQUEST:                    For the President to announce the award of contracts to
                                 manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
                                 detection devices for installation at airports throughout the
                                 United States.

     PURPOSE:                    To amplify the President's commitment to airport security
                                 and to help combat terrorism in our Nation.

     BACKGROUND:                 In 1996, the White House Commission on Aviation
                                 Safety, led by Vice President Gore, recommended that the
                                 FAA purchase innovative security equipment to help
                                 insure the safety of the flying public. This
                                 announcement would be the purchase of 21 FAA-certified
                                 explosives detection systems and 135 trace explosives
                                 detection devices, which add to the multi-year deployment
                                 of innovative security equipment recommended by the
                                 Commission. In FY99, FAA has $100 million to
                                 continue this deployment, and the President requested
                                 $100 million in his FY2000 budget.
