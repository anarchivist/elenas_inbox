             Elena ... I'm sorry about any confusion about Wednesday's meeting.  I
             should have included you out of habit ... and I certainly didn't realize
             that you were focusing on the issue. Here's the request I sent out
             earlier. Do you think we need to gather our internal crew with John for a
             seperate meeting tomorrow or Wednesday morning, or should we be ok with a
             pre-meeting immediately before? k

             Caroline ...

             As you know, John agreed to hold a Pay Equity Meeting on Wednesday (2/10)
             afternoon with Senator Harkin and Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton.  I
             understand that this is a somewhat politcally complex discussion,
             especially in light of the other individuals who have been invited to
             participate. Can I work with you today to make sure that this meeting is
             organized in a way to make it run as smoothly as possible? Also, do we
             need to hold an internal pre-meeting (and who do we want involved on our
             side)? An will you be preparing John a background / briefing memo for
             this? Thanks a lot.   k
