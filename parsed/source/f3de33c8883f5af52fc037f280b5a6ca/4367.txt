TEXT:
we didn't beef about events. He opened by saying he knew our lives were
tough and asking how he could make them better.  People came up with
obvious things -- it would be nice to have more support staff, and the
schedule makes it hard to find time for reflection and follow-up.  I think
Mike did say there is too much focus on events, but others said we enjoy
this stuff, we are political, and we recognize its importance. But he
seemed to glom onto that idea.
