TEXT:
We need to figure out who, if anyone, from DPC needs to go to Chicago on
Tuesday Oct. 28 for the President's education event.   Rahm and Sylvia are
both on the trip and' could brief. The briefing would be for the
President's morning education event and for the First Lady's Education
speech in the afternoon.   Spaces on the plane are tight blc of guests
coming along for the First Lady's birthday activities. Mike Cohen thought
he could be useful, but defers to Elena blc of her Chicago ties.   I think
if Elena cannot go then we should recommend Mike. Laura, please check
with Elena. Thanks.
(Other factors:  Sec. Riley is not going on the trip. Also, if the Elena
or Mike want to stay for the First Lady's event it would mean they would
have to fly commercial airlines back to D.C. )
