Subject:         Follow-up to Your Phone Call

Last night, you left me a message about a letter to Erskine from a number
of senior groups requesting a meeting about Title V of the Older Americans
Act.  I strongly recommend against a meeting with Erskine.

The groups are opposing the tranfer of Title V from DOL to HHS, which we
have proposed in our budget for the last 2 years.   (The transfer proposal
is a result of the VP's REGO initiative.)  I have consulted OMB, HHS, and
DOL on this issue, and determined that we can not/should not change our
position.  I have spoken to Steve Protulis of NCSC at length about this
issue. HHS is meeting with the groups on this subject tomorrow.    If your
schedule permits, I'd be happy to ~chedule a half-hour meeting for you to
discuss this issue with the groups.

In addition, I'd like an opportunity to complete our abbreviated meeting,
and do need your advice on the FDR controversy and on plans for a
disability meeting with the President and Erskine.
