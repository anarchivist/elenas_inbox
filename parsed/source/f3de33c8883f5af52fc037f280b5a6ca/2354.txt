TEXT:
The Vice President's Welfare-to-Work Coalition is meeting Wednesday,

September 3.    Coalition members and state and local officials will be in

attendance. There will be a stand-up lunch and informal mix-and-mingle

session from 11.30-1.00 in the Indian Treaty Room.    We would really

appreciate each of you spending some time working the room meeting with

his coaltion members.     Ideally we would like you in room 450 at 11.15 so

that the Vice President can acknowledge you before everyone heads over to

the Indian Treaty Room.     If you cannot make 11.15 but will be able to drop

by the lunch please let me know.    Thank yo
