TEXT:
Kevin Thurm is planning to call the state commissioner shortly and fax him
the letter.

Skolfield promised McCurry Q&As by 12:30 -- they are currently in internal
review at HHS.  Before we knew this, Toiv asked me for Q&As.  I've since
talked to Toiv and we've agreed to wait for the HHS ones.

Angus King checked in the COS office -- apparently they have not yet
offici'ally said yes to the Texas request for a meeting.

I am working on materials for the COS in case there's a meeting and will
have the final letter soon.

Also Podesta and Thurm apparently spoke last night about how to answer a
reporter's question about sub-state waivers and think the answer should be
that the Administration is willing to consider sub-state waivers and would
have to look at the results of a sub-state waiver before considering any
state-wide policy.
