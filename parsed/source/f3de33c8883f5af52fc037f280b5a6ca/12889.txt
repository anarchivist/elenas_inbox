TEXT:
As I mentioned to you, Congo Sander has inquired about a possible meeting
with John to discuss his request that the President appoint a "National
Commission on Voter Turnout" to explore the causes and possible solutions
for this nation's low voter turnout rates.  In response to this request, I
thought it might be useful for you to convene a meeting to discuss our
views on the merits of the idea.

I will forward to you a copy of Sanders' letter which was cosigned by
Reps. bonior, Boehlert, Campbell, and Conyers.

Thanks.    Let me know what you think.
