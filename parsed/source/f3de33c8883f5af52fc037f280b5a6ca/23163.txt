THE WHITE HOUSE

Office of the Press Secretary
(Little Rock, Arkansas)



For Immediate Release                                    March 13, 1999


STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

  I was deeply disturbed to learn of the attempted bombing of a family
planning
clinic in Asheville, North Carolina.    We can all be grateful that no one
was
harmed and that the clinic suffered only minor damage.   But whether or not
a
terroristD!,s bomb achieves its deadly purpose, such cowardly and criminal
acts
strike at the heart of the constitutional freedoms and individual
liberties all
Americans hold dear.   I strongly condemn this act of senseless violence.
Federal agents are already in Asheville to assist local law enforcement
officials.   I am confident that the perpetrators of this terrible act will
be
brought to justice.
