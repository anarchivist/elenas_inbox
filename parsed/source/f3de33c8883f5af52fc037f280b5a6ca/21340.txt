                              RADIO ADDRESS ON CANCER
                                SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA
                                   September 26, 1998

        Good morning. Cancer, as everyone knows, is the cruelest of fates; and it strikes nearly
every family. It struck mine, and I lost my mother to this devastating disease. Losses like these
are the reason why tens of thousands of Americans are coming together today, on the National
Mall in Washington, DC, with one, common purpose: to focus our nation's attention on cancer.
Gathering today are patients and survivors; families and friends; doctors and Americans from all
walks oflife. The Vice President, who has led our administration's struggle against cancer, will
join their ranks, and will speak about the specific steps we are taking to win that fight.

        This morning, I want to talk to you about our overall vision of cancer care and research as
we approach the 21 st century. This is a time of striking progress, of stunning breakthroughs.
With unyielding speed, scientists are mapping the very blueprint of human life, and expectations
of the Human Genome Project are being exceeded by the day. We are closing in on the genetic
causes of breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. New tools for screening and diagnosis
are returning to many patients the promise of a long and healthy life. It is no wonder the
scientists say we are turning the corner in the fight against cancer.

        For six years now, my administration has made a top priority of conquering this terrible
disease. We have helped cancer patients to keep health coverage when they change jobs. We
have accelerated the approval of cancer drugs while maintaining safe standards. We have
increased funding for cancer research, and, as part of our balanced budget, strengthened Medicare
to make the screening, prevention and detection of cancer more available and more affordable.

       Still, we know that we must never stop searching for the best means of prevention, the
most accurate diagnostic tools, the most effective and humane treatments -- and, someday soon, a
cure. To that end, there are several steps we must take.

        First, to build on our remarkable progress, I have proposed an unprecedented multi-year
increase in funding for cancer research. As studies proceed, we must remember that patients, as
much as scientists, have a critical perspective to add to any research program. That is why I am
announcing that all federal cancer research programs will, by next year, fully integrate patients
and advocates into the process of setting research priorities. Next, as we continue to unravel the
genetic secrets of cancer, we must apply that knowledge to the detection of this disease. I am,
therefore, issuing a challenge to the scientific community: to develop, by the year 2000, new
diagnostic techniques for every major kind of cancer so we catch it at its earliest and often most
treatable stage. Also, we should give more patients access to cutting-edge clinical trials, so they
                                                                              Hex·Dump Conversion

    -- and researchers -- can get faster results. That is why I am directing the National Cancer
    Institute to speed development of a national clinical trials system -- a simple, accessible resource
    for health care providers and patients across the nation. I am also urging Congress to pass my
    proposal to cover the costs of those trials for Medicare beneficiaries, who need them most.

            Finally, we are fighting against the leading cause of preventable cancer by doing
    everything we can to stop kids from smoking. America needs a Congress that has the courage to
    finish the job and pass comprehensive tobacco legislation.

            New technological tools; new networks of information; new research priorities: all are
    part of our overall approach to health care that puts the patient first. On this day, as Americans
    renew our national fight against cancer, we do well to remember that we are doing more than
    curing a disease. Weare curing the ills that disease may cause -- the stigmas, the myths, the
    barriers to quality care. The concerned citizens on the Mall today show that we are overcoming
    those barriers, one by one, and at the same time building a stronger and healthier America.

           Thank you for listening.
