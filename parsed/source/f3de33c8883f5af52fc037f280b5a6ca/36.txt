             FEDERAL ARRESTEE DRUG TESTING PROGRAM
                                QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Presidential Announcement:

       The President will announce that the Federal Government is establishing a policy
providing for drug testing for everyone arrested in the Federal criminal justice system. Federal
prosecutors will seek appropriate sanctions, including periodic testing, when an offender tests
dirty.

Ouestions and Answers:

                                       THE DIRECTIVE

Q:     What is the purpose of this directive?

        There is a direct link between drug use and crime -- both because people commit crimes
under the influence of drugs and because they commit crimes to sustain their drug use.
        Through this directive, the President is ensuring that the criminal justice system will
accurately and speedily identify the users of drugs. Once this identification is made, the justice
system can order the user to undergo periodic testing while on release or, when appropriate,
detain the user.

       The result of this measure --- a reduced the level of drug use in the population of
offenders under criminal justice supervision, which will lead to a reduction in criminal behavior.

       The President's program will serve as a model for State criminal justice systems, where
the majority of criminal cases are processed. Several State Attorneys General and local
prosecutors have committed to working with their State legislatures to adopt similar programs.


Q:     Why is this being proposed now?

        The concept behind this Directive was recommended in the President's 1995 National
Drug Control Strategy. It is strongly supported by several experts on crime and drugs. We
have been working with them, the Justice Department, and the Federal courts for some time in
the formulation of this initiative.



Q:     How wilHt be accomplished?
                                                                         Hex-Dwnp Conversion


        The President will sign a Directive to the Attorney General directing her to develop a
universal policy in which federal arrestee would be tested for drugs before decisions are made on
whether to release them into the community pending trial. He would further direct her to
establish a policy whereby federal prosecutors will request sanctions, such as detention, when
appropriate or on-going testing for arrestee who fail these initial drug tests.


                                       HOW IT WORKS

Q:     How exactly will it work?

I)     Offender is arrested for a Federal offense and given his/her rights.

2)Offender is taken to Federal booking station or other facility by agent where s/he is processed
       by a U.S. Marshal -- fingerprinted, photographed, etc.

3)Under this Directive, the government would at this stage request that offender take a drug test.

4)Within 48 hours, offender appears before a Federal Judge or Magistrate for initial appearance
       (during that 48 hours offender is injail in the custody of the U.S. Marshal). It is at this
       appearance where the Judge/ Magistrate makes a bail determination.

5)Judge is made aware of drug test. Judge asks U.S. Atty for the Government's recommendation
       on bail. Based on results of the drug test and other information, Federal prosecutor will
       recommend detention or bail conditions, including regular drug testing.


Q:     What happens if the arrestee fails the drug test?

       The Federal prosecutor would request that the court require detention or impose
appropriate conditions including additional testing and treatment.

Q:     What happens if the arrestee refuses to submit to a drug test?

        Prior to the first appearance before the judge, the government cannot compel an arrestee
to take a drug test. Nevertheless, based on the results of a pilot program by the courts, over 80%
of arrestee agreed to take the test when asked. If the arrestee refuses, the judge is made aware of
that fact before making a bail determination.

                           CURRENT SITUATION AND IMPACT

Q.     Doesn't drug testing already occur in every Federal District?




                                                 2
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

        Only a few Districts in the Federal system have uniform testing of Federal arrestees.
Most Districts attempt to "screen" an arrestee for drug use by means other than testing. If there
are indications of such use, the court may order testing, treatment and other sanctions as
appropriate.

        The current situation lacks the certainty that will exist under the President's program.
The Clinton Drug Testing Program requires offenders to be tested before their initial court
appearance. This provides the judge with the best information before any decision is made on
pre-trial release.

        A 1988 Drug Act required the Federal Courts to establish and evaluate pretrial drug
testing in several Districts. The report from that program recommended exactly what the
Clinton Federal Arrestee Drug Testing Program will accomplish.

Q:     How many people does this affect?

       Between 45,000 to 50,000 individuals are arrested and processed through the Federal
system for criminal felonies every year. Over 60% of those offenders are on pretrial release
within a day.

Q:     How much will it cost?

        The Justice Department estimates that the first six months of the program would cost
roughly $3-5 million including treatment. The cost of the program is likely to decrease in the
future as a result of advances in the technology and efficiency of drug testing.

       By March 31, 1996, the Department ofJ ustice will develop a plan to ensure the use of the
most accurate and cost effective testing methods.
