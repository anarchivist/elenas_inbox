TEXT:
I have collected about 15 resumes for you and Bruce to consider, and will give
them to you today.  Most are FYI -- we have already replied by phone or mail
saying we would hold for future consideration.  I have six relatively new
arrivals addressed to me or Carol. I'd like to handle these and any new ones
that come to me or Carol by having.Dorothy send a note telling the applicant
she's forwarding resumes on to Bruce for his consideration, and that his staff
will follow up with applicants directly.  Are you o.k. with that approach?
