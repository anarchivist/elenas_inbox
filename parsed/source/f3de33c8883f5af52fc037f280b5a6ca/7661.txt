TEXT:
OSTP is troubled by the restricted use of funds in the NIH research
portion of Sec. 1106 of S.1415 ("Sec.2804 NIH research activities" pp.
593-597).  As you may know, Dr. Varmus and Senators Mack, Harkin, arid
Specter have raised similar concerns.  Where 'does this issue stand, and
what is the appropriate forum and most useful way for OSTP to present its
concerns.  Thanks.
