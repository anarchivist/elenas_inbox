 EK/LS:

Rahm asked Leanne and I to re-draOft the state prisons drug directive
that's been on the shelf for some months now and get him a copy today.   I
just dropped off the attached version and faxed it to DOJ and ONDCP.
Originally, he wanted it for the radio address, but I think that's no
longer in play.  Instead, I believe he wants the directive's imminent
signature to make into the coverage tomorrow night on Joe Califano's
speech on this topic Oat the Press Club.

Also, please note that while the concepts in the directive were originally
proposed by DOJ -- baseline requirement, promoting increased penalties
from smuggling drugs into prisons, and using prison construction funds for
testing/treatment -- our directive proposes a slightly different
mechanism.   I'm suggesting that funds made available to states for
testing/treatment be contigent on their enacting tougher penalties for
smuggling drugs into prisons (equivalent to what's in the Crime Bill.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

SUBJECT: Zero Tolerance for Drug Use and Availability in Prisons

Crime rates in this country have dropped significantly for 5 years, and the overall number of
Americans that have used drugs is down nearly 50% from its peak 15 years ago. Also,
drug-related murders have dropped to their lowest point in a decade, and recent drug use surveys
indicate that -- for the first time in years -- teen drug use is leveling off, and in some instances,
modestly decreasing. All of this new is encouraging.

Nonetheless, much more can and needs to be done to continue to bring down drug use and
increase public safety. With more than half the individuals in our criminal justice system
estimated to have a substance abuse problem, promoting coerced abstinence within the criminal
justice system offers us a unique opportunity to break this cycle of crime and drugs. That is why
my Administration consistently has promoted testing drug offenders and demanding that they get
the treatment they need to get off drugs and stay out of trouble. We have worked to expand the
number of Drug Courts throughout the country, and increased the number of federal arrestees and
prisoners that are tested and treated for drugs.

However, we can do much more to promote coerced abstinence among state prisoners and
parolees. When a drug user ends up in a state prison, we have a chance to break his or her
addiction. Convicted offenders who undergo drug testing and treatment while incarcerated and
after release are approximately twice as likely to stay drug- and crime-free as those offenders
who do not receive such testing and treatment. But when drug addiction inside prisons is
ignored, the demand for drugs runs high. In this environment, corrections officers struggle to
keep their prisons drug-free. Often drugs are smuggled in by visitors; sometimes even by
compromised prison guards.

Simply put, to maintain order in our prisons and to reduce drug-related crime, we should not
tolerate drug use and trafficking within the nation's prisons. Thus, as we discussed, I understand
that you will:

       (I) Amend the guidelines requiring states receiving federal prison grants to submit plans
       for drug testing and treatment to include a requirement that states must also submit a:
       baseline report of its prison drug abuse problem. In every subsequent year, States will
       then be required to submit comparable data in order to measure the progress they are
       making towards ridding their prisons of drugs.

       (2) Expand existing programs of training and technical assistance to the states in the areas

                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
detection technologies.

(3) Draft and transmit to the Congress legislation that will permit states that move
towards enacting stricter penalties for drug smuggling into prisons to use their federal
prison funds for drug testing and treatment of their prisoners and parolees.
