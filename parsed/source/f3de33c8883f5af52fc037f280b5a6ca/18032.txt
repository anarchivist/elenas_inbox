FROM:                    BRUCE REED

RE:                      CHILD CARE INITIATIVE


        As you know, the White House staff has been working closely with various agencies to
develop options for your consideration for your child care initiative. Today, I chaired a meeting
with the First Lady and appropriate members of your Cabinet to discuss the initiative. While we
will forward shortly a detailed decision memorandum, I wanted to give you a sense of the range
of proposals under consideration. Attached is the detailed discussion memorandum prepared for
today's meeting. In brief, the proposals under consideration are:

Proposals under Consideration

Tax Relief for American Families. Modify the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit (CDCTC)
to better assist low- and middle- income Americans with child care costs (the CDCTC has not
been adjusted for inflation since 1982).

Tax Credits for Businesses. Provide a tax credit to businesses that incur costs related to building
or operating child care facilities, training child care workers, or providing resource and referral
services to employees (some version of Senator Kohl's proposal).

Subsidies. Increase federal investment in the Child Care and Development Block Grant
(CCDBG) to enable states to provide child care subsidies to additional low-income working
families with children under 13. Currently, we assist only about 13% of the families eligible.

Standards Enforcement. Invest in a fund (possibly structured as a set-aside from additional
investment in the CCDBG) for states to improve licensing and enforce state child care health and
safety standards -- specifically, to increase the number of unannounced inspections of child care
facilities (which the military credits for its improvements).

Scholarships and Training for Child Care Providers. Establish a Child Care Provider Scholarship
Fund (which you announced at the White House Conference on Child Care) to provide
scholarship funds to students working toward a child care credential, and expand Department of
Labor's Child Care Apprenticeship Program to fund training of child care providers.

Research and Evaluation. Establish a new fund to support research and demonstration projects,
data collection, technology development, a National Center on Child Care Statistics, and a
national child care hotline. Currently, no funds are targeted for these activities on a national
level.
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion '

Early Learning Fund. Establish a new fund to promote early learning and parent involvement
and education. The fund would support the following activities: providing basic training to
child care providers (including first aid and CPR, and training in child development); creating
and supporting family day care networks (e.g. connecting individual child care providers to
centers for education and support); assisting providers in meeting accreditation and licensing
requirements; linking child care providers with health professionals; and providing home visits,
parent education, and consumer education about child care. This program would provide
challenge grants to communities.

Early Head Start. Increase the Early Head Start set-aside (perhaps by doubling it), while
boosting overall funding in Head Start to ensure that increasing the set-aside does not reduce the
resources available for children ages 3-5.

School-Age Opportunities. Expand the 21st Century Community Learning Center Program to
provide start-up funds to school-community partnerships to establish before- and after-school
programming for school-age children in public schools.

Stay-at-Home Parents. Enable more new parents to make the choice to stay home with their
children by expanding FMLA to cover businesses with 25 employees and/or to extend the time
period from 12 weeks to 24 weeks, or by providing paid parental leave coverage for a limited
amount of time for new parents below a set income level. Another option under consideration is
to establish a demonstration project to enable states to test innovative approaches to help parents
to stay at home during their children's first years of life.

Views of Your Advisors

         Your advisors feel that any proposed tax off-sets should be spent on tax credits ( e.g., the
child and dependent tax credit or tax credits to businesses). Secretary Rubin supports the tax
proposals, particularly credits to businesses. However, he cautions (as does John Hilley) that, as
it is unlikely for a tax bill to be enacted this year, our child care initiative should not rely heavily
on tax pieces.

         On the non-tax spending proposals, while there is considerable consensus on many of the
items described above, there is disagreement on the levels of investment in affordability versus
quality improvements. More specifically, Frank Raines recommends that we help low-income
families afford child care, target the needs of young children, and help states enforce state health
and safety standards. CEA agrees that child care affordability for low-income families should
be the top priority. HHS, while believing that affordability is critical, feels that efforts to
improve children's health and safety in child care must be central to the package. Gene Sperling
argues strongly that a separate piece of the initiative should focus on early learning and parents as
first teachers, based on the research highlighted at the recent White House Conferences. The
VP's office, the Department of Education, and the Attorney General feel strongly that the great
need for increased after-school programming must be addressed as a central part of the initiative.
   Rahm Emanuel envisions your child care proposal to be the next significant initiative in your
on-going commitment to working families.
