TEXT:
Bruce has reviewed the draft press paper and thinks its ok (he actually
likes it better than I do; I'm still tightening it)  He asked me to call
about a half dozen reporters about the announcement before completing the
revisions, so we can get some attention to the story. Then I'll complete
the draft and send it to you for review and comment.
