TEXT:
         Please read Richard Cohen's piece on late term abortions in
the Post today.   Both Cohen's column and Sunday's David Brown
article articulate one of the fallacies surrounding this debate:
that the President is in favor of late term abortions without any
restrictions.

        Cohen's article indicates that Clinton is "apparently
misinformed" about the number and nature of late term abortions
and urges him to look at "the new data," which indicates that "the
majority" of late term abortions are done for non-medical reasons.

        As we all know, as early as February 28, 1996, in his
letter to Congress, the President says, "" ... I cannot support its
use on an elective basis, where the abortion is being performed
for non-health related reasons and there are equally safe medical
procedures available."

         Also, no one ever notes that Governor Clinton signed a bill
in   Ark. that would ban third trimester abortions.

        I spoke to Melanne this morning and she thinks that I ought
to call Cohen.  I believe that we should write a letter responding
to his column.
        Your thoughts?
