TEXT:
We've heard that a group called Coral Ridge Ministries, a fundamentalist
group based in Florida, is running full-page ads in the NY Times and USA
Today articulating a number of diseases for which "homosexuals" are
responsible.  The Washington Post has been asked to run it, but has not
yet agreed.  They are also apparently citing a CDC person in their claim
that 50% of gay men are HIV positive (HHS is trying to find out who this
person is) .

Thought you might want to know.
