REMARKS BY VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
NOMINATION OF DAVID SATCHER AS SURGEON-GENERAL
Friday, September 12, 1997

        IO,m pleased to welcome Secretary Shalala; Dr. Satcher, his wife
Nola, and their wonderful family.  WeO,re also joined by Dr. Randolph
Smoak, the Secretary and Treasurer of the American Medical Association;
Dr. Nathaniel Murdock, President of the National Medical Association; and
Dr. Robert Graham, Executive Vice President of the American Academy of
Family Physicians.

        This is an important day for the health of AmericaO,s children and
families.  In David Satcher, President Clinton has found that rare
combination of the personal and the professional -- someone whose profound
personal understanding of health and disease is matched only by his long
record of accomplishment in the fields of medicine and public health.

         Dr. Satcher learned about illness and disease first-hand, when he
survived a near-fatal bout of the whooping cough as a young child -- and
he stands before us today, not only healthy and strong, but with a
demonstrated commitment to protecting our childrenO,s health.   As one of
ten children growing up on a farm in Alabama, he knows the special
challenges of reaching out to remote and underserved communities, and
ensuring that all our people have access to quality health care. And I
believe it is no coincidence that his own familyO,s experience with breast
cancer has been followed by years of leadership in treating and preventing
that all-too-common illness.
   ..

        As Aldous Huxley once wrote, experience is not what happens to a
man -- it is what a man does with what happens to him. I know David from
his presidency of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee -- in
fact, Tipper served on the board during that time.  But he has also been a
highly distinguished medical professor and scholar; and a widely
recognized leader on issues ranging from cancer to sickle cell to food
safety.

        But most important to me is Dr. SatcherD,s commitment to keeping
tobacco out of the hands and lungs of AmericaD,s children.  Smoking is the
greatest public health challenge in America today -- a deadly habit that
America has got to break.  ID,m proud that this President has done more to
cut off childrenD,s access to tobacco than any President in history -- and
ID,m proud that he is nominating a Surgeon General who will be a true
field commander in the war against underage smoking.

        WeD,ve been very, very lucky to have Dr. SatcherO,s leadership at
the Centers for Disease Control these past four years -- and weD,11 be
even luckier to have him as both our next Surgeon General and our
Assistant Secretary for Health -- fighting for the health of our children
and families, and bringing his tremendous experience and understanding to
bear as AmericaD,s family doctor.  Now IO,m pleased to introduce President
Clinton, who can add this selection to his own very long list of
achievements in the area of public health.  Mr. President ...
