Subject:         HR 1852 - Multi-jurisdiction Cases

Heads Up -
The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to markup HR 1852 tomorrow.
This bill expands Federal court jurisdiction in a very narrowly defined
category of cases - mass tort litigation arising from a "single event or
occurence. 1I




Last Congress, HR 1252 - The Judicial Reform Act - included an identical
provision.  The 3/10/98 Justice letter on H.R. 1252 stated that "we would
consider supporting such a provision separate from this legislation."

Justice expects to submit a short letter to OMB for clearance supporting


HR 1852 for quick clearance (in time for transmittal before tomorrow's
lOam markup) .
