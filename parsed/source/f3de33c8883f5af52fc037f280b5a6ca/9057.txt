                              WELFARE CASE LOAD ANALYSIS

There are a number of factors that appear to contribute to the different rates at which the
caseloads are declining for different racial and ethnic groups. The primary factors are listed
below, along with currently available data. Staff are continuing to do additional analysis to
determine the magnitude of these factors.

The raciaI!ethnic composition of welfare caseloads has been changing gradually over the
last 25 years: whites rose from 38 percent in 1973 to a peak of 42 percent in 1983 and have
dropped steadily to 35 percent in 1997. The proportion of blacks has generally declined, from 46
percent in 1973 to 37 percent in 1997. The most significant trend is the increase in the Hispanic
portion of the caseload, from 13 percent in 1973 to 23 percent in 1997. However, this is not too
surprising given the rapid increase in the Hispanic population overall.


                             TOTAL        WHITE            BLACK            HISPANIC        OTHER

 % of Total Pop 6/98         100%         72%               12%              11%            4%


The question is how welfare reform may be affecting these historic trends. National data on the
raciaVethnic characteristics ofwe1fare recipients are only available through June 1997, so it is
hard to gauge the impact of the past year when welfare reform efforts accelerated so rapidly.
States provided more recent data to the Times (generally through June 1998), but HHS has
concerns that some of these data may have problems, particularly NY and CA. They are
working with states to verify the data.

It is also worth noting that the caseload data only tells who is currently on the rolls; it does not
tell the rate at which different groups are entering and exiting. Analysis of entries and exits will
be conducted in the near future.

The number of white, black and Hispanic families receiving welfare have all dropped since
1994 (when caseloads peaked nationally, but the rate of decline has been greater for whites
than blacks, with an even slower decline for Hispanics.

                                                % Change
Whites 1.9M       I.4M       -26%
Blacks      1. 8M      l.5M       -18%
Hispanics   1.0M         .9M           -9%
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

The changes are more dramatic than the actual mix of who is left on the caseloads, at least
on a national basis.


Whites 37%             35%
Blacks          36%           37%
Hispanics       20%           23%

There is some encouraging evidence from Census data that the employment rates of former
welfare recipients are increasing even faster for minorities than for whites, although the
actual rates and the disparity between groups remains disturbing. Between 1996 and 1997, the
percentage of all prior year welfare recipients who were employed in the next year increased by
28%. The increase was highest for blacks (33%), followed by Hispanics (22%) and whites
(21 %).

Minorities on welfare disproportionately share characteristics that may make it harder to
leave the rolls. These factors include: lower education levels, lower marriage rates, larger
families, isolation from areas with jobs, and employment and housing discrimination. March 95
Current Population Survey Data shows the following characteristics for public assistance
recipients in 1994:

Historical data confirms that minorities are more likely to remain on the welfare rolls
longer. At the same time, the proportion of long-tenn recipients on the rolls is increasing
slightly. This would partially explain why the current rate of caseload decline is slower for
minorities and why they are making up an increasing share of the welfare caseload.

The trends in marriage rates and births to unmarried women could contribute to an
increasing proportion of minority families going on welfare. While the proportion of
never-married single mothers is increasing for the entire population, the rate of is largest for
Hispanic women (based on CPS data).

In addition, the rate of births to unmarried teenagers remains much higher for blacks and
Hispanics than for whites. And, while the rate is decreasing significantly for blacks and slightly
for whites, it continues to increase for Hispanics. For example, between 1991 and 1996, the rate
of births to unmarried teenagers decreased 18% for blacks and 4% for whites, but increased 3%
for Hispanics.
only cases are decreasing more slowly than cases headed by adults, this would appear to
contribute to the increasing proportion of minorities on the caseload.

Q:    What is the President announcing today?

A:    Today, President Clinton will celebrate the success of the Welfare to Work Partnership,
      which has grown from 105 to 5,000 companies since it was launched at the White House
      last May and whose member companies hired over 135,000 welfare recipients in 1997.
      The President will challenge the Welfare to Work Partnership to double its welfare hires
      to 270,000 in 1998 and urge every business in America to look to welfare recipients to fill
      labor shortages created by the booming economy. The President will be joined by
      United Airlines CEO Gerald Greenwald, who will release a report showing hiring welfare
      recipients can cut company turnover.

      The President will release new data showing that welfare to work efforts like these are
      paying off -- welfare caseloads have dropped to 8.9 million, a record drop of 3.3 million
      since he signed welfare reform into law and 5.2 million since he took office. To sustain
      this success, the President will announce the first Welfare-to-Work competitive grants
      from the $3 billion fund he fought to include in the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. These
      $186 million in grants will support 49 innovative efforts across the country to help the
      most disadvantaged welfare recipients get and keep jobs. In addition, new funds for the
      President's welfare to work transportation plan, which were included in the ISTEA bill
      which passed Congress last week, will help even more welfare recipients go to work.

Welfare to Work Partnership

Q:    You say that over 5,000 companies have joined the Welfare to Work Partnership.
      What does that mean? Have they all actually hired welfare recipients?

A:    All 5,000 companies have either already hired welfare recipients or have pledged to do
      so without displacing other workers. ill 1997, approximately 3,200 Partnership
      companies hired more than l35,000 welfare recipients.

Q:    I understand the Partnership is releasing some sort of report today at the White
      House? What does the report say?

A:    The report, The Road to Retention, is a case history of 16 businesses, including five small
      companies, whose retention rates for welfare recipients are higher than the retention rates
      for non-welfare hires. At United Airlines, for example, welfare hires have about half the
      turnover rate of regular hires. This report provides examples of what successful
      companies do to promote retention, including forming partnerships with service agencies

      to provide child care, transportation, mentoring, and counseling services, providing
      on-the-job or pre-employment training, providing health and other benefits, and holding
      welfare to work employees to the same high standards as other employees.

Q:    Who runs the Welfare to Work Partnership? Is it part of the White House?

A:    No. The Welfare to Work Partnership is an independent, nonpartisan, national
      effort of the American business community to help move those on public assistance into
      jobs in the private sector. Gerald Greenwald, the CEO of United Airlines, is the
      chainnan ofthe partnership's board of directors, and Eli Segal is the Partnership's
      President and CEO. The Partnership was formed in response to the President's challenge
      in his 1997 State of the Union speech to forge "a new national effort to marshal America's
      businesses, large and small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work."

Welfare Caseloads

Q:    What are the new caseload numbers that the President announced today?

A:    The President released new figures showing welfare caseloads have fallen to 8.9 million, a
      record drop of 3.3 million since he signed welfare reform into law and 5.2 million since
      he took office. The welfare rolls have declined by 37 percent since January 1993, when
      they stood at 14.1 million, and by 27 percent since their August 1996 level of 12.2 million.
       The percentage of the U.S. population on welfare is at its lowest since 1969 -- 3.3
      percent.

      As the attached chart shows, the welfare caseloads have fallen by nearly 900,000 since
      the numbers released in January as part of the President's State ofthe Union speech.
      The new figures are from March 1998; the data released in January were from September
      1997.

Q:        Do you know what happened to all those people who left the rolls? Aren't some
          simply being cut off of welfare? Do you consider this a success?

A:        Not enough time has passed for full scale research studies to be completed, but several
          state studies show that between 50 and 60 percent of those who leave the welfare rolls do
          so for work. (Others leave because of marriage, their youngest child turning 18, an
          increase in child support, receipt ofSSI, increase in earnings by another family member,
          or sanctions). Welfare reform is resulting in more recipients going to work: the most
          recent data from the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey show that work rates
          among welfare recipients increased by 20 percent from 1996 to 1997. HHS estimates
          that this means 1.7 million people who were on welfare in 1996 were working in 1997.
          Many states are using sanctions to enforce work rules, and we think that is entirely
          appropriate. Data from several state studies find that after being sanctioned, about half
          the people go to work and approximately 40 percent have an increase in their income.
          Several states also found that one-quarter to one-third of those sanctioned return to the
          rolls, presumably after complying with the requirements.

Q:    Do you think there will be enough jobs for all the welfare recipients who need them?

A:    We believe that economy will create enough jobs for welfare recipients without
      displacing other workers. Remember, we've created over 15 million new jobs since this
      Administration took office and unemployment -- at 4.3 percent -- is at the lowest level in
      28 years. At the same time, we recognize that we should give some extra help to
      communities where it will be harder for welfare recipients to find jobs. That's why the
      President fought for and won the $3 billion Welfare-to-Work grants which states and
      cities can use to create job opportunities for welfare recipients, particularly targeted at
      hard-to-employ individuals in high poverty areas. That's why the President fought for

      welfare can get to where the jobs are, the President proposed -- and the Congress
      has now passed -- funds for welfare to work transportation in the ISTEA
      transportation bill.

Welfare to Work Grants

Q:    What are the grants that the President announced today?

A:    Today, the President announced the first round of competitive grants from the $3 billion
      Welfare-to-Work program he fought for in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The $186
      million in grants from the Department of Labor will support 49 innovative welfare to
      work efforts designed to move long term welfare recipients into lasting, unsubsidized jobs.
       These awards are the first of five rounds of competitive grants to be awarded in 1998
      and 1999. Twenty five percent of the Balanced Budget Act's $3 billion welfare to work
      funds are to be awarded on a competitive basis, with the remaining 75 percent to be
      allocated by formula to states to be used by local Private Industry Councils to help welfare
      recipients who have significant barriers to employment obtain and retain jobs. A
      description of some of the 49 grantees is available for the press.

Q:    How are these grants different from the other welfare reform funds states get?

A:    These funds are targeted specifically at the hard-to-employ welfare recipients who need
      help the most -- long-term recipients with poor education, low skills, and little job
      experience, living in high poverty areas.

Welfare to Work Transportation

Q:    I understand welfare to work funds were included in the ISTEA bill which passed
      the Congress last week. Are these the funds the President requested in his budget?



                                              -4-
      transportation bill. You may recall that he highlighted the importance of welfare to work
      transportation a year ago, when the Welfare to Work Partnership was launched at the
      White House, and again in the State of the Union. His budget included a $100 million a
      year proposal for welfare to work transportation. The ISTEA bill which passed the
      Congress on Friday includes up to $150 million a year for local efforts to help welfare
      recipients get to where the jobs are.

Federal Welfare Hiring

Q:    How many welfare recipients has the federal government hired?

A:    According to the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government has hired
      4,811 welfare recipients since March 1997 when the federal hiring initiative was
      launched. This is 48 percent of our goal of 10,000 hires by the year 2000. As a part of
      this effort, the White House pledged, and has already hired, six welfare recipients.

Q:    How was the goal of 10,000 hires set?

A:    These numbers represent the Federal government's fair share of the effort to hire welfare
      recipients. The Federal government is approximately 1.5 percent of the nation's
      workforce. To meet its portion of the President's challenge to move 2 million people off
      welfare by the year 2000 -- which amounts to moving about 700,000 adults into the
      workforce -- the Federal government ought to hire about 10,000 welfare recipients.

Q:    How can you hire welfare recipients when government is downsizing and budgets
      are tight? Are you creating special preferences for welfare recipients?

A:    It is true that the government is downsizing. Since the President took office, he has
      actually shrunk the Federal government to its smallest size in three decades. However,
      downsizing does not mean there are no jobs to fill. As in any organization, there is a
      natural amount of tumover injobs at all levels. The Federal agencies have committed to
      reaching out specifically to the welfare popUlation to fill those positions.

      We are not creating any preference such as the one that exists for veterans. Weare
      encouraging the departments to use existing hiring authorities, including programs that
      allow departments to cut through red tape and hire entry-level workers quickly and easily.
       We are also encouraging outreach efforts to our federal contractors, grantees and
      partners. This is the same commitment that the President has asked of the private sector.
