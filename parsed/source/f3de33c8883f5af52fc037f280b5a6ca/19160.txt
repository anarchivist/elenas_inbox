TEXT:
The Equal Pay meeting with outside folks is confirmed for today at 4pm in
my office, Room 15 OEOB. Those attending from the outside include: Karen
Nussbaum, Gerry Shea, Chris Owens(coming with Karen AFL) , Susan bianchi
Sands, and Marcia Greenberger .
.... .. they wanted to bring the world with them but I suggested a smaller
meeting was the best at this point!

Judith Lichtmann is the only one we have not heard from yet and Gerry Shea
is a "maybe" although he will do his best to make it.

Also, Karen said they were planning an event with the Senate for
Thurs ........ they were in a planning meeting this morning.  I asked her if
they had discussed combining White House with others and our event being
"the event" ........ and she said, of course, if WH has announcement for an
event ......... so it is clear to me that no event has really been planned
yet, but I'd say they are pretty focused on getting something going by
tomorrow.
