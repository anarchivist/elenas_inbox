CONCURRENCE OR COMMENTS
ASAP.  THANKS

H.R. 987 -- Workplace Preservation Act, H.R. 1439 -- Safety and Health
Audit Promotion and Whistleblower Improvement Act, and H.R. 1459 -- Models
of Safety and Health Excellence Act, are scheduled for mark-up by the
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections, Committee on Education and the
Workforce, Wed., May 18 at 10:30AM.

H.R. 987 -- Workplace Preservation Act:            Secretarial VETO
recommendation.

H.R. 1439 -- Safety and Health Audit Promotion and Whistleblower
Improvement Act:        Strongly oppose.

H.R. 1459 -- Models of Safety and Health Excellence Act:           Support



H.R. 1381 -- Rewarding Performance in Compensation Act is scheduled for
mark-up by the Subcommittee on Workforce protections, Committee on


Education and the Workforce, Wed., May 18 at 10:30AM.    The draft letter
contains a secretarial veto recommendation.

BACKGROUND:     H.R. 1381, the "Rewarding Performance   in Compensation
Act", would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)   to prevent incentive
bonuses (e.g., commissions) from being included in an   employee's "regular
rate" of pay for the purposes of calculating overtime   compensation.

                        under current law, covered employees are
guaranteed compensation for hours worked beyond the 40-hour workweek.
Overtime compensation is defined as 1.5 times the "regular rate" of pay,
and now includes payments such as performance bonuses and commissions.
The sponsors of H.R. 1381 argue that current law deters employers from
rewarding their FLSA-covered employees by complicating their accounting
processes and increasing overtime costs.

                        Labor's argument (and the argument of organized
labor) is that the bill could lead employers to reduce the hourly wages of
their employees, paying a larger portion of their salary in the form of
bonuses in order to avoid paying a higher overtime rate.    It views the
bill as diminishing employees' rights to just overtime compensation under
the FLSA and as a threat to the 40-hour week.  In particular, DOL argues
that it allows employers to pay artificially low hourly wages with
"excludable" bonus pay based on production or efficiency that would
diminish workers' compensation for extra work.

The Honorable Cass Ballenger
Chairman
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
Committee on Education and the Workforce
u.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Ballenger:

  I am writing to provide you with the views of the Department of Labor
. on H.R. 1381, the "Rewarding Performance in Compensation Act." This
  bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) to exclude from
  the definition of regular rate payments made to reward employees
  for meeting or exceeding productivity, quality, efficiency, or sales
  goals as specified in a gainsharing, incentive bonus, commission,
  or performance contingent bonus plan.    The effect of this amendment
  would be to diminish employees' entitlements to overtime premium
  pay under the FLSA.   The Department of Labor strongly opposes this
  bill.

This bill would substantially reverse the FLSA's long-standing
overtime policy and drastically weaken existing protections for
workers.   It represents an assault on the 40-hour workweek and an
employee's right to receive true time-and-a-half overtime premium
pay.  Moreover, this bill does nothing to guarantee to workers that
they would ever share in their employers' gains that would come from
their having to work excessive overtime hours.

The bill would allow an employer to pay artificially low hourly wages
and structure a compensation scheme with "excludable" bonus pay that
is based upon production or efficiency, enabling an employer to
effectively transfer much of its risk to the workers.  The bill would
not guarantee workers the right to receive any incentive
compensation, but it would guarantee employers the right to exclude
any such pay from overtime. Workers' only rights if this bill became
law would be overtime at time-and-a-half at their artificially
decreased hourly wage, not their true regular rate.    This will have
the perverse effect of encouraging employers to work their employees
for longer hours with no guaranteed compensation for their extra
work, exactly the opposite of the original intent of the FLSA's
overtime standards.
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

The Department strongly opposes this bill's attempt to undermine
workers' rights and the 40-hourworkweek. These requirements, which
have been in place for over 60 years, provide vital worker protections
that discourage employers from working employees excessively long
hours and ensure fair compensation to employees for the burdens of
working extended hours for their employer. Because it is contrary
to the best interests of the Nation's workers who would be affected
by it, if this bill were presented to the President, I would recommend
that he veto it.

The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no
objection to the presentation of this report and that enactment of
H.R. 1381 would not be in accord with the Adminisration's program.

                              Sincerely,



                             Alexis M. Herman
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

The Honorable Cass Ballenger
Chairman
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections
Committee on Education and the Workforce
U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Chairman Ballenger:

I am writing to inform you ofthe views of the Department of Labor regarding three bills the
Subcommittee on Workforce Protections may mark up this week: H.R. 987, the "Workplace
Preservation Act," H.R. 1439, the "Safety and Health Audit Promotion and Whistleblower
Improvement Act of 1999," and H.R. 1459, the "Models of Safety and Health Excellence Act of
1999."

H.R. 987, "Workplace Preservation Act"

The Department is strongly opposed to H.R. 987, which is intended to delay the issuance of a
protective standard on ergonomics until the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has completed
another study of the scientific literature regarding musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and
ergonomics. Each year, over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-related MSDs.
It is time to act to prevent these injuries and reduce the toll of suffering and the enormous
economic cost they entail. Employers currently spend more than $15-20 billion a year just on
the workers' compensation associated with MSDs; the total annual cost of our failure to address
ergonomics may be as high as $60 billion.

During the negotiations on the FY 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act, Congress and the
Administration agreed that the Department would proceed with promulgating its ergonomics rule
while the NAS conducted its study. H.R. 987 would undermine this agreement by forcing the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to wait another 18 months to two years
before issuing a standard, allegedly in the expectation that the conclusions of a new NAS study
will be different from those reached by (1) NAS just last year after a six month study
commissioned by Congress; and (2) the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health,
which completed an exhaustive study in 1997. Both of those studies concluded that MSDs are
caused by physical forces in the workplace and that ergonomic solutions can reduce those forces
and reduce the incidence ofMSDs.

Major public health organizations, medical societies and scientific groups, including the
American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the American Public Health
Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons oppose H.R. 987 and urge OSHA to move ahead with a protective standard. After
more than ten years of experience with ergonomic programs in the red meat industry, exhaustive
scientific study, and millions of unnecessary injuries, it is clearly time to move ahead.

I urge the Subcommittee to vote against H. R. 987. IfH.R. 987 were presented to the President
                                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion     .

for his signature in its current fonn , I would recommend that the President veto the legislation.


H.R. 1439, "Safety and Health Audit Promotion and Whistleblower Improvement Act of 1999"

A second bill to be marked up is the Chainnan''s bill, H.R. 1439, which addresses two important,
but unrelated issues: OSHA's access to and use of employer records in enforcement
proceedings, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act's outdated and inadequate protections
against retaliation for employees who "blow the whistle" on safety violations or refuse to engage
in unreasonably dangerous work. Although I appreciate the courtesy you have shown by sharing
the draft bill with us and in soliciting suggestions for improvement, we cannot support H.R. 1439
in its current fonn. This bill fails to make adequate changes in the Act's protections for
whistleblowers and hampers enforcement of the OSH Act through its treatment of employer
self-audi ts

H.R. 1439 makes three positive changes in section 11(c) ofthe OSH Act, the provision of the Act
that protects whistleblowers against retaliation: it lengthens the statute of limitations from 30
days to 60 days; it provides for an administrative remedy in the Occupational Safety and Health
Review Commission instead of requiring the Secretary to pursue relief for employees in federal
district court; and it allows the employee to pursue his or her own case if the Department of
Labor moves too slowly or decides against pursuing the employee's case at all.

Nevertheless, each of those provisions is not as strong nor as effective as related provisions the
Administration has forwarded to Congress in the Hazard Reporting Protection Act of 1999. We
feel strongly that the statute of limitations under section 11 (c) should be 180 days, rather than 60
days. We believe that Department of Labor's Administrative Law Judges would provide a faster
and more reliable forum for trying whistleblower cases than the Review Commission, which
often finds itself without a quorum or with only two members who cannot act to resolve a case,
and which has no expertise in retaliation and employment discrimination cases. And while H.R.
1439 allows employees to pursue their own cases, it does not provide for interim relief, a critical
remedy that can make it possible for employees with no source of income to pursue lengthy
litigation to vindicate their rights.

Moreover, it appears that H.R. 1439 eliminates important remedies that are currently available
under section II(c), the right to recover compensatory and exemplary damages. While
exemplary damages have rarely been awarded, they provide an important deterrent against
employer misconduct, and compensatory damages are vital to assuring that whistleblowers who
have suffered discrimination are made whole. The Administration's Hazard Reporting
Protection Act of 1999 explicitly provides for compensatory and exemplary damages, and
provides for the award of costs and attorney fees to the prevailing plaintiff.

As for the self-audit provisions ofH.R. 1439, the Department is deeply concerned with the
extraordinarily broad privileges for employer self-audit infonnation that the bill would afford.


                                                 2
                                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


The bill would provide that virtually any employer evaluation of workplace conditions, practices,
or operations could be withheld by the employer in any OSHA inspection or enforcement
proceeding, with narrow exceptions. The bill protects any information obtained or prepared in
connection with safety and health audits, and defines an audit as including any evaluation of
workplace conditions, practices, processes, operations, or systems designed to identify and
prevent potential or real workplace hazards. In short, even the smallest amount of knowledge
an employer gains through a daily walkaround of a plant, or from a conversation about a
particular process, is immune from disclosure to OSHA. In effect, this bill would immunize from
disclosure all knowledge an employer has about safety or health in his workplace, or about his
workplace's compliance with the OSH Act.

The key problem with the bill is that it would place off-limits to OSHA the very information it
needs to determine whether there has been a violation of the Act, unless OSHA first establishes
that a violation exists -- a greater impediment to OSHA enforcement would be hard to devise.
In many cases, particularly those involving workplace accidents, employer records provide not
only the best evidence but the only evidence. The bill's requirement that OSHA independently
establish any violation before having access to employer-generated information would bar OSHA
from access to the very information it needs to accurately assess conditions at the workplace, and
would gravely impair the agency's ability to enforce the Act. The bill's supposed exception for
cases where the Secretary proves employer bad faith amounts to requiring the agency to prove a
willful violation before it is even granted access to the most basic health and safety data.

Conscientious employers know that there are many advantages to employer-sponsored workplace
audits and evaluations. Employers who can demonstrate good faith efforts to identify and
correct workplace hazards have learned they can benefit from sharing this information with
OSHA. On the other hand, an employer who learns of hazardous conditions but who has taken
no action to protect his employees, may have reason to conceal such audits from OSHA. The
self-audit provisions of H.R. 1439 would primarily benefit such employers. Because these
provisions would seriously impair OSHA's compliance program without contributing to
employee health or safety, the Department strongly opposes H.R. 1439.

H.R. 1459, "Models of Safety and Health Excellence Act of 1999"

The Department is a strong supporter of the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), which would
be codified by H.R. 1459. I would like to thank the sponsors of the bill, Representative Petri
and Representative Andrews, who shared drafts ofH.R. 1459 with the Department and asked
for our comments before introducing the bill. While we would like to work with you further on
the employee participation requirement, we are pleased to say that we endorse your efforts to
codify the program, and believe it will help raise the stature of the VPP, OSHA's oldest and
most important recognition program for excellence in workplace safety and health management
and cooperation.

The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the presentation
