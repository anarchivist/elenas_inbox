This week's goodies:

Crime -- COPS Retention:  Earlier this week you asked about how a new COPS
initiative would deal with the issue of retention. Currently, we plan to
set aside $50 million for one-year waivers to assist
economically-distressed communities in absorbing long-term costs of their
new police hires. Addressing the retention issue on a case-by-case basis
through waivers will allow us to avoid creating an incentive for local
police departments to depend on federal grants indefinitely.  Such an
approach will also require law enforcement agencies to demonstrate
hardship before receiving a fourth year of funding.  In FY 98, Congress
earmarked a $100 million in COPS funding for a retention initiative that
targeted smaller jurisdictions, which are the ones most at risk of
failing to meet their long-term funding commitment. At the time, we
feared that this program might encourage these smaller departments to
apply for additional assistance -- and not meet their original funding
obligations. Ultimately, however, only $13.4 million of this retention
funding was spent due to limited demand.  Thus, we believe that $50
million should be sufficient to address the issue of retention in a new
COPS initiative.

Crime -- Preliminary 1998 FBI Crime Statistics: On Sunday, the FBI will
release the crime figures collected through the Uniform Crime Reporting
System for the first six months of 1998. The preliminary data show a 5
percent decline in overall crime compared to the half-year figures of
1997, with violent crime down 7 percent, and property crime down 5
percent.    Specifically for violent crime, murder decreased 8 percent;
robbery, 11 percent; and 5 percent each for aggravated assault and rape.
For property crime, larceny dropped 5 percent; motor vehicle theft 8
percent; burglary 3 percent; and arson 12 percent.    Serious crime
declined in each region of the country, with the Northeast experiencing
the greatest decline in serious crime (8 percent) followed by the West (6
percent), the South (5 percent), and the Midwest (one percent).   Cities of
all sizes reported decreases in serious crime, with the greatest declines
reported by cities with populations between 50,000 to 99,000 (8 percent)
and over one million (6 percent). The smallest declines in serious crime
were reported by cities with populations of under 10,000 (3 percent).
(Note to EK:  All of percentage declines are for the number of offenses,
not rates.)
