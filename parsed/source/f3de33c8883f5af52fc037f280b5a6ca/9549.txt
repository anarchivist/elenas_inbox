Our small grants just got smaller!  I just got off the phone with Justice
-- the figure they originally gave us for the total grant amount for
telemarketing fraud is wrong.  Instead of over $3 million, it is only
about $1.7 million. The four grantees are the same.   They mistakenly gave
us two-year figures which included FY 97 grants.

Let me know if you have any questions.
