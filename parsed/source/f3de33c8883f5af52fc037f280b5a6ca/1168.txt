New Firearms Initiatives                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Q. What does your Child Safety Lock Directive do?

        Firearms claim the lives of too many of our children. My directive requires all Federal
Agencies to provide a child safety lock and proper instructions with every handgun issued to a
Federal law enforcement agent. This Directive will help prevent gun accidents and children's
access to guns.

        My Anti-Gang legislation that I sent to Congress would further expand use of child safety
locks by requiring all Federal Firearms dealers to provide a child safety lock with every handgun
they sell. Until Congress makes child safety locks the law of the land, we must do everything
we can to prevent unauthorized firearms use by our young people.

       The Directive would take the first step in that direction by making this a
universally-adopted safety policy for all Federal law enforcement agents.

Q.     How would you restrict gun sales to noncitizens?

       Federal law requires that legal aliens live in a state for at least 90 days before they are
allowed to purchase a handgun. But the application to buy a gun fails to ask how long an
applicant has lived at his or her current address.

         As a first step to reduce illegal handgun purchases by noncitizens, the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms will immediately require applicants to certify that they have been residents
for at least 90 days in the state where they are trying to buy a gun.

        But this isn't enough. I also support the Kennedy-Durbin/Schumer legislation which
prohibits foreign visitors to the United States from purchasing and possessing firearms.

Q. What would you do about "cop killer" bullets?

       Criminals should not have access to handgun ammunition that can pierce bullet-proof
vests worn by law enforcement officers. While current law establishes limits on ammunition
based on specific materials from which it is made, it does not address the problem of excessively
powerful ammunition based on its performance.

        Once again, I will send legislation to Congress banning "Cop Killer" bullets. My
legislation directs the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate regulations to prohibit the
manufacture, importation, and distribution of handgun ammunition that can pierce standard
bullet-proof vests. We need a simple test and a straightforward ban. These bullets have one
purpose only-- to kill police officers. They have no place on our streets.
