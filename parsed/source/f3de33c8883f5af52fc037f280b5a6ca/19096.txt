TEXT:
Please check everyone's schedule for 5pm on Monday for an Equal Pay
meeting with Marcia Greenberger, Judith Lichtmann, Susan Bianchi Sands and
Karen Nussbaum.
(Susan Bianchi is possibly out of town but we would include her on the
phone. However, she is going to try and get back by late afternoon.)    If
5pm works, then, we'll call Marcia, Judith and Karen first thing Monday
morning.  thanks
