Sorry to be pestering you, but I was just wondering if you'd had
any luck with your former students. My intention is to try to do
interviewing this week and early next, so it is done before I go
off honeymooning.
Meanwhile, I don't know if you picked up the thread of the
conversation when I walked in to Ab's office this morning but
jeeeezzzz    I'll tell you about it later.
And we're on for tomorrow evening. See you later.
