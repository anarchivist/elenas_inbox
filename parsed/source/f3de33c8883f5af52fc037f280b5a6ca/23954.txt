TEXT:
Attached is the answer to a question that we may recieve following Senator
Breaux's testimony at the Finance Committee this morning. As you know, he
is reportedly saying that he will drop the eligibility age increase
provision. He also is suggesting his openness to a subsidy for all
Medicare beneficiaries to help pay for a prescription drug benefit.
Clearly, we are going to have to give a positive reception to this news.
However, it is important to temper our reaction with our oustanding and
remaining concerns with the Breaux-Thomas proposal; otherwise, it may be
taken to be an endorsement of it by our paranoid left flank.

Thanks -- please call with questions.

    Q:   How do you respond to Senator Breaux's testimony today before the Senate Finance
         Committee (in which he says his next proposal will drop the eligibility age increase
         and he suggests that he is open to providing a subsidy for all Medicare beneficiaries
         for a drug benefit)?

    A:   We welcome Senator Breaux's commitment to drop the eligibility age increase provision
         from his Medicare reform proposal. The President has long stated that it would be bad
         policy to promote legislation that would inevitably lead to an increase in the numbers of
         uninsured in this nation. We believe the Senator's remarks about being open to providing
         financial support for all Medicare beneficiaries to help access needed prescription drugs
         are also constructive. Modernizing the Medicare program and preparing it for the 21 sl
         century simply cannot be achieved without addressing the prescription drug coverage
         issue adequately. We agree with Senator Breaux that providing for a prescription drug
         benefit should be done in the context of a broader reform package.

         While we are encouraged by Senator Breaux's testimony, we continue to have major
         differences. For example, we could not support his premium support proposal (and its
         implicit premium increase on beneficiaries desiring to stay in the traditional program), the
         proposal for an unlimited home health care copayment, and the proposal's lack of
         dedicated financing necessary to deal with retirement of the baby boom population.

         We look forward to working with Senator Breaux and all Members of Congress to
         produce a Medicare modernization package that strengthens and improves the program.
         The President believes we have an historic opportunity to do so this year and we should
         take advantage of it.
