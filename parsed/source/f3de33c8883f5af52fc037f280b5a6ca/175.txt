                            July 18, 1996


        Dear Speaker Gingrich:
           Just over a year ago, I shook hands with you
        and publicly affirmed my commitment to reforming
        the nation's campaign finance laws.   Now I call on
        the House of Representatives to send me legislation
        that will address the American public's desire for
        real change in our political process, and in so
        doing renew our democracy and strengthen our
        country.    I support the comprehensive, bipartisan
        legislation crafted by Congresswoman Smith,
        Congressman Meehan and Congressman Shays and I
        strongly believe that the House should be able to
        consider this legislation when it addresses
        campaign finance reform later this week.   In
        particular, I approve of several reforms such as
        placing limits on spending, curbing PAC and
        lobbyist influence, discounting the cost of
        broadcast time, and reforming the soft money
        system.
          Organized interests have too much power in the
        halls of government.   Oftentimes, representatives
        from such interest groups operate without
        accountability and are granted special privileges
        that ordinary Americans don't even know exist.   In
        addition, elections that represent an opportunity
        in which ordinary voters should have the loudest
        voice have become so expensive that these voices
        are sometimes drowned out by big money.
           Let us capitalize on the progress made in the
        last three years.   In 1993, we repealed the tax


       loophole that allowed lobbyists to deduct the cost
       of their activities.   In 1994, I signed a law that
       applies to Congress the same laws it imposes on the
       general public.   Last year, Congress answered my
       call to stop taking gifts, meals, and trips from
       lobbyists, and I signed the Lobbying Disclosure Act
       into law. We now have an opportunity to finish the
       job by addressing campaign finance reform.

       The Honorable Newt Gingrich
       Page Two
         As we work to reform campaign finance, we must
       do everything in our power to ensure that we open,
       not limit, the political process.  Our goal is to
       take the reins of our democracy away from big
       special interests, from big money, and to return
       them to the hands of those who deserve them --
       ordinary Americans. Real reform is now achievable.
       I urge the House to pass sensible, comprehensive
       bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation and
       give the American people something we can all be
       proud of.
                       . Sincerely,



       The Honorable Newt Gingrich
       The Speaker
       United States House of Representatives
       Washington, D.C.  20515
