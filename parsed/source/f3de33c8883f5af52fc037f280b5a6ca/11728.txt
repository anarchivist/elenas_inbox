TEXT:
I have a lawstudent named Peter Alderman who is graduating this summer,
and is interested in doing foreign policy work for the Gore campaign or
some executive or legislative office beginning in August.  He would
probably work for free for the Gore campaign if the policy work were
meaningful. He has clearly organized his coursework, extracurriculars, and
work experience around his international focus, and seems a serious capable
fellow.  He was very smart in my Contracts class.

I suppose if it is for the Gore campaign, I should contact Ron Klain, but I
do not know his current contact information.  So I wanted to ask you for
that, and also whether you could think of anything else suitable for this
fellow in some executive or legislative office.
