TEXT:
Here is more information on the budget proposal that OMB arid DOJ/INS have
been developing.  The offsets I think are okay but I am a little concerned
about the border patrol offset since a bipartisan group of members have
criticized the President for not hiring 1,000 more border patrol.
However, I think we can argue tha this offset is going toward another INS
enforcement function - ie detention.

Please advise if you have any concerns with this offset.

Thanks.

Subject:         INS Detention Amendment

We are in the process of clearing an INS' mandatory detention budget
amendment for FY 2000. To support the $230 million we are requesting will
require comparable offsets. There are two offsets for which we would like
your concurrence:

Reinstatement of the 245(i) adjustment of status provision which permits
eligible individuals to adjust to permanent resident status upon payment
of a $1000 penalty. The Administration fought hard and unsuccessfully to
enact a permanent extension in FY 98 and the program expired on January
1998. Janet Murgia has touched base with the Hispanic Caucus and they are
supportive. NSC and DPC also have no objection. We are estimating
receipts from this penalty provision will total approximately $110M in
2000.

Reallocation within INS' Enforcement Account of $20 million from the
annualization savings in FY 2000 associated with the slow hiring of the
1,000 Border Patrol agents in FY 1999.  INS is estimating they will only
hire 200-400 towards the 1,000 goal in FY 99. They will likely hire the
remaining agents to the full 1,000 funded during the first half of FY
2000.  The President's Budget assumed that we would be paying for 1,000


additional agents for the full year, starting on October 1, 1999.
However, because not all of the agents will be on board on October 1, INS
estimates they will "save" $20 million in salary/benefit costs.   These
funds will remain within INS' Enforcement Account, albeit for detention
purposes. We want to alert you, however, because the optics may be
interpreted as a lack of Administration support for the 1,000 Border
Patrol agents.

If you object to these offset or have any concerns, please contact Michael
or me at your earliest convenience. Thanks.
