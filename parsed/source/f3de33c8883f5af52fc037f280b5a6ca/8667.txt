                        I am writing to express my concern over the Congress's unprecedented effort in recent
               weeks to restrict safe reproductive choices for women. It is regrettable that some Members of
               Congress have chosen to pursue a series of initiatives designed to create a political issue at the
               risk of increasing unintended pregnancies and abortions and of compromising women's health
               and safety.

                       I have long said that I believe abortion should be safe, legal, and rare. All of the
               proposals being offered would restrict safe medical choices. Some would actually restrict access
               to family planning information and services and could have the perverse effect of increasing the
               number of unintended pregnancies and abortions. I urge the Congress to put partisan politics
               aside and instead put women's health and safety first.

                       First, I am very disappointed that the House struck Congresswoman Lowey's proposal to
               require health plans participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program to cover all
               FDA approved prescription contraceptives. The Lowey proposal would have improved basic
               health care coverage for many women and helped reduce unwanted pregnancies and the need for
               abortion.

                       Second, I strongly object to the amendment to impose restrictions on international family
               planning programs. By prohibiting foreign non-governmental organizations from receiving
               United States funds if the organization uses any non-US government funds for abortion-related
               services, the amendment jeopardizes funding to health care providers who are working to meet
               the growing demand for family planning and other critical health services in developing
               countries. Moreover, requiring recipients of US funds to refrain from advocating changes or
               even calling attention to alleged defects in abortion law would interfere with lawful free speech
               and the ability of organizations to participate in the democratic processes of their own countries.
               Ultimately, the result of this amendment's provisions could also be an increase in unintended
               pregnancies, abortions, and maternal and infant death.

                       Third, I find it deeply disturbing that Congress would take the unprecedented step of
               intervening in the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process by banning funding for
               the approval or testing of drugs such as RU-486. For years, the FDA has used vigorous testing
               and the highest scientific standards to protect public health. This amendment substitutes
               political ideology for sound science. It would restrict scientific research that can protect
               women's lives and offer them safe medical choices.

                       Fourth, I am disappointed that the House chose to reject the changes that I proposed to the
               Child Custody Protection Act. As my Administration conveyed to Congress, I would support
               properly crafted legislation that would make it illegal to transport minors across state lines for the
               purpose of avoiding parental involvement requirements. I have repeatedly stated that I would
               sign a bill ifit were amended to exclude close family members from criminal and civil liability
               and to ensure that individuals who provide only information, counseling, referral, or medical
               services to the minor cannot be subject to liability. As amended in this way, the legislation
               would prevent the circumvention of state parental involvement laws, while ensuring healthy
               family communications. Unfortunately, the Congress has ignored these proposed changes, as
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

          well as those designed to address constitutional infinnities in particular provisions identified by
          the Department of Justice, In doing so, this Congress has demonstrated that it is not truly
          interested in passing legislation, but only in creating another partisan political issue.

                   Finally, Congress is again indicating that it will tum the difficult debate over so-called
          partial birth abortions into an opportunity to score political points, rather than to pass legislation
          restricting this procedure. I have long opposed late tenn abortions, and I believe that we
          generally should prohibit the use of this procedure. I have insisted, however, on exempting
          those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is necessary to save a woman's life or to
          protect her against serious injury to her health. I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow,
          tightly drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign it and put an end to all other uses of this
          procedure.

                 I urge Congress to move beyond ideology and political maneuvering, to abandon
          extremism, and to protect women's lives and health, while reducing the need for abortion.
          Congress's current course would remove appropriate reproductive choices for women, seriously
          jeopardize their health, and very possibly increase the frequency of abortions. I will strongly
          oppose these efforts.
