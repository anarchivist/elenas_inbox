PRESIDENT CLINTON: Yesterday, I signed a bill, for example, which
completed
the agenda that I said I would try to achieve for poor people in
America to give them a chance to get more jobs and to allow them to
save more of their own money when they're moving off welfare.  It was
a very important bill.  It also contained our increase in Head Start
funds, another commitment I made. And Gene Sperling came in, and he
handed me this statement we put out in September of '93. And
everything I said I would do on that list has now been done.
