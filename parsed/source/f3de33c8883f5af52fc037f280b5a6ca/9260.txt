TEXT:
EPA tells me the Solicitor General's office is ready to    file its appeal in
the EPA Environmental Tobacco Smoke case.  EPA wants to    know if we want to
do anything with it.  If not they might want to work it    into a speech
Browner is giving tomorrow. Looking at the schedules I     think our options
are:

1) Browner announce   tomorrow (or later)

2) VP announce (in person or on paper). Eli Attie says all his speeches
Monday in NYC are political, Tuesday he's down, Wednesday's a state
visit ... but something could be possible. I'm trying to reach David Beier
to see if he likes it.

3) POTUS paper statement.

I think the annoucement of the appeal would be much better if we could
couple it with the announcement of EPA's ETS public service
announcements.  They aren't quite ready yet, but EPA is checking to see if
there's a protype or something that could be shown during the
announcement.
