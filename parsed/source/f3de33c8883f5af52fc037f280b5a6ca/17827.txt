TEXT:
I just had another conversation with DoJ and I and they are comfortable
with this document being released as a "working document n tomorrow.    By
IIworking document II we mean something which the Board can use as a
discussion tool (if they want) for their meeting and a document with
Education can use in order to condUct outreach with relevant communities
-- which I have confirmed they have not yet done.     I have asked DoJ to
make this guide a priority at this point and, if they do so, DoJ and I are
confident that the document can be re-worked into a useable tool and the
appropriate bases can be touched in the next 2 weeks.     (I guess that would
take us up to about the time of the town hall?)

How does that timeframe sound?
