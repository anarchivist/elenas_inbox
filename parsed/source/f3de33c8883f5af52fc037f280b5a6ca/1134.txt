TEXT:
Since it looks like we are not going to be using the parental involvement
report for Michigan, we need to decide whether we want to use it another
day soon.  ED is hoping to use its release to pitch a satellite town
meeting that is coming up on March 11th.  In addition, they feel they
really need to get the report up to the Hill within the next two weeks.

Keep in mind that the First Lady's office was interested in being involved
with the release of this as well.

Thanks.
