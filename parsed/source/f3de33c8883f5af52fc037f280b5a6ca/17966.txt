I. Should the $1.50 increase be only from the settlement or other factors?

        President said "up to $1.50."

        Should be real settlement costs.

       Industry estimates show non-settlement costs could easily eat up all but .62 of the 1.50
       increase. Inflation is particularly important.


II. What are the effects of different levels of price increase on consumption?       How does it
effect industry profitability?

       Starting at about $1 where teen smoking has diminished by 30%, rates drop by 5-6%
       every 25 cents up to $2.00. At $3 there is a 66% decrease.

       Legislatively reduced prices lead (minus decrease ads and legal costs) to 10-17% lower
       profits.

      FTC analysis shows that industry would increase prices above settlement costs. A 200%
      pass through of settlement costs to prices leads to a present value of after tax profits
      increases by about 78%.

       Liability protection would lead to rising stock prices alone.

      Tobacco farmers would suffer lower value quotas as cigarette prices rise.

      Wholesalers/retailers suffer from reduced demand, possible penalties, loss of point of sale
      advertising.

      Local/state excise taxes will diminish depending on the size of the excise tax.



III. Does the rate that prices increase make a difference?

      This analysis didn't assume a sudden increase would have a different effect from an
      incremental one.

      Arguably a sudden increase could have a shock effect, alternatively people may be better
      at adjusting their behavior over time.

      Also sharp increases may lead to smuggling problems.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conve;sion ·

IV. Three possible approaches: (a) companies pay per pack into fund; (b) an excise tax,
(c) public health user fee per pack, please discuss.

A.    Antitrust exemption so that the tobacco companies can pay per pack increases into
      settlement fund is not warranted.

      --even without an antitrust exemption, the cigarette manufacturers will raise prices to the
      amount of the settlement or greater than the settlement.

      --FTC report concluded that there was insufficient justification for an antitrust exemption
      even unrelated to price such as achieving the goal of reducing youth smoking or as an
      exchange with the tobacco companies for the possibility that the settlements restrictions
      may be ruled unconstitutional.

B.    A volume-adjusted penalty, excise tax, or per pack charge are effectively identical from a
      consumer point of view.

C.    The current net stream of government revenue as envisioned by the settlement is
      substantially smaller than the face value contained in the settlement, and will decline over
      time.

      --If objective is to fund public health programs, the payment should rise over time in line
      with the needs of the programs. By analogy, other entitlement programs have
      experienced rates of growth far in excess of inflation rates.



V.    How big a price increase is necessary to achieve the youth smoking targets?

      Price increases due to inflation alone will not help meet youth targets.

      About $1.45 in fifth year to achieve 30% reduction; about $2.40 in seventh year to
      achieve 50% reduction; and about $3.00 per pack in tenth year to achieve 60% reduction
      (These estimates do not include any effect from non-price aspects such as access and
      advertising restrictions).

      Comprehensive and strongly enforced restrictions on youth access to cigarettes could
      have significant effects on reducing underage use of cigarettes; might need incentives for
      communities to make compliance efforts; perhaps 20 to 40% reductions if strong
      enforcement of access restrictions.

      Advertising restrictions are less clear on reducing youth smoking --the conclusions of
      several studies on advertising restrictions varies.
                                                                               Hex-DiJmp Conversion ·

VI.    How big a price increase to offset costs of smoking-related illnesses to the Federal
       government?

       A.     Medicare: costs of smoking-related illnesses are unclear because lower costs of
              healthier population are offset by increased life expectancies associated with
              reduced rates of smoking.

       B.     Medicaid, Veterans benefits, and FEHBP: costs unclear for the same reasons as
              for Medicare.

       C.     TRICARE for active-duty military (fonnerly known as CHAMPUS): more direct
              cost savings because this program serves a population under the age of 65.



VII.   What are implications of $1.50 price increase for cigarette consumption, smoking
       rates, industry profitability, farmers, retailers, and wholesalers for different
       combinations of penalties and price increases?

       President called for increase of up to $1.50 per pack.

       Penalties will lead the industry to deter youth smoking (ifit is able to do so) through
       non-price mechanisms if penalties are larger than the profits earned from youth smoking.

       Tension between fighting smoking and having stable funding stream.

       Administrative problems with relying solely on penalties as a means of raising settlement
       revenues. Issues re: reliability of youth smoking rates contained in surveys.



VIII. Ways to structure look-back penalties for missing youth smoking targets.

       A mix of industry-wide and company-specific penalties would provide the best
       incentives; industry-wide penalties would promote efforts by all companies to reduce
       underage smoking; company-specific penalties would eliminate incentive for company to
       keep selling to youth and only pay part of penalty.

       Substantial economic justification for de minimus exception assuming there is a
       "hard-core" group of youths that companies have no control over, regardless of the
       companies' actions.

       One-time payment in year after target missed based on number of packs sold in previous
       year provides a known revenue vs. Per-pack taxes in year after target missed provides
       unknown revenue because level of sales is unknown when tax rate is instituted.

Non-linear penalties provide the greatest incentives --i.e., penalties should increase as
non-compliance rises.
