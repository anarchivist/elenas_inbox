TEXT:
i had breakfast this morning with all of the govs dc reps. no surprises
just confirmation of what we thought to be true:

1. both r and d's hate per capita cap and both in their own ways expressed
that it is ridiculous to talk about an expansion for kids in a cap
situation.  the d's said they were concerned about the viability of the
program on the hill; r's said that their govs are on the hill looking for
ways to reduce the medicaid # and get rid of the cap--didn't directly
target kids but did talk about potus "misguided education policy" as a
potential source for money. some d's did make it clear that they would
abandon-the kids inititative in one second to get rid of per capita.

2. on flsa--both r's and d's expressed great concern. we need a white
house meeting and a fast decision. ray is now engagaed in a real
way--making calls and talking to govs.

3. low dispropotionate share states are angry about the 12% policy--and
gave me a really hard time. d's pressed hard on the policy rationale for
this.

4. asked about our position of privatization by some staff. again, i think
we need a white house meeting to decide the direction we want to go here.
