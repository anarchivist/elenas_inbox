TEXT:
BR/EK:

Dennis B. and Ricki called to make sure it was okay to notify Conyers and
Clyburn/CBC about our radio address tomorrow afternoon sometime.  I told
them I thought we'd decided not to tell them until Friday -- but Ricki
understood the we'd decided not to invite them, but to tell them
tomorrow ... before they hear it from the civil rights types.

Please clarify.
