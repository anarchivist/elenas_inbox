     Subject: Telegram on Proposed Cloning Legislation



 During yesterday's Public Affairs Executive Committee (PAEC) conference
 call, the PAEC instructed us to send the following telegram to all members
 of the U.S. Senate:


 "The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)
 urges the Senate to proceed extremely cautiously as it considers
 legislation regarding human cloning. While the Federation considers the
 cloning of a human being to be reprehensible, dangerous, and unethical, we
 are concerned that overly restrictive legislation could unintentionally
 preclude critical research of great benefit to the American people.  We
 believe that S. 1599, currently pending consideration by the Senate, would
 be damaging to worthwhile research.  By flatly banning all use of human
 somatic cell nuclear technology for any purpose, this legislation would
 close off key areas of research which do not involve the creation of
 humans. We urge that the Senate not approve this legislation in its
 current form as it does not balance appropriate ethical considerations
 with the health needs of the American people."


 The message was sent yesterday evening for delivery today.
