EK:

Quick update on today's meeting.  Sylvia handed out a draft of the
"initiative" that we had to be returned after the meeting.  Basically, it
included the following:

Three goals: (1) promote dialogue and improve understanding of race; (2)
increase understanding of the nation's diversity and where it's taking us
(demographics, trends?); and (3) focus the nation on the issue and what we
can do (approaches, solutions, but also raising issue to new level .. i.e.,
environmental analogy .. ?).

Five proposed activities: (1) Commission and staff; (2) Presidential event
each month for the next year, including 4 town halls and the white House
conference on Hate Crimes; (3) the President's/Commission's report to the
American people; (4) website for comments; and (5) miscellaneous -- and
unannounced policy pieces in the areas of the economy opportunity,
housing, health care, education and criminal justice.

It was made clear that the June announcement will not mention proposed
policy pieces (law changes, programs, etc.), only our search for
"approaches and solutions" of import. Sylvia mentioned that, if we need
to give examples of the types of things we'll do, we can mention the
ongoing "educational affirmative action policy", and that you should
follow-up with Chris Edley on this piece.

I hope this is at least marginally helpful. The Church arson report was
bumped to tomorrow's meeting (I left a copy for you with Laura).

I may not be able to make tomorrow's meeting, at least not for the
duration. will you be going? Let me know if you think I need to be there
(Paul scheduled interviews for us with the support staff candidates from
10 to 12 tomorrow).

Regards,
