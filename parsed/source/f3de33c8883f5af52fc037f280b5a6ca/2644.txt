Subject: French proposed Denver Summit Communique Language

At our week-end meeting with the Denver Summit Sherpas, the French Sherpa
proposed that the following paragraph be added to the Communique. All
agreed to consider the French proposal and to consult with capitals in
order to properly respond to it.


 [Human cloning:

 We have taken note with great concern of recent scientific experiments
which could open the way to reproductive human cloning. We agree that the
prohibition of any form of reproductive human cloning needs both strict
domestic legislation and close international cooperation to adapt current
international law. We are encouraged by the reflections underway within
national ethics committees as well as in various regional and
international fora.  We are determined to give a strong impetus to their
work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a universal ban on
reproductive human cloning.]


We will be receiving comments from other countries tomorrow on this and
other sections of the draft communique, and will prepare a revised draft
by the end of the week.  I will need your preliminary proposed
revisions/edits on Thursday, with a cleared inter-agency position by
Friday.  Please call me at 6-5363 if you have any "process" questions.
