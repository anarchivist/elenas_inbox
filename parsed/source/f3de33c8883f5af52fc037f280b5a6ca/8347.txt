MEMORANDUM TO THE PRESIDENT

FROM:

RE:            Position on amendments to require health plan coverage of contraceptives


Later this week, an appropriations bill may come to the floor with an amendment, sponsored by
Congresswomen Lowey, that would require contraceptive coverage by all plans participating in
the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEBHP). At the same time, Senator Snowe is
considering introducing on the Senate floor a bill that would require this coverage by all health
plans. The Lowey amendment was passed by the House Appropriations Committee last week
(28 to 26). Your advisors (DPC, Women's Office, Communications, OMB) generally agree that
we should support the Lowey amendment, but either be silent on or oppose the Snowe bill. The
difference in position reflects our concern about benefits mandates; supporting this one makes it
difficult to defend against others and could affect the debate on the Patient Bill of Rights.
However, since we typically make coverage decisions for Federal programs, our support for the
Lowey amendment can be described as appropriate and consistent with our position on
contraception and that FEHBP should serve as a model for other plans to voluntarily follow.

BACKGROUND

Most health plans cover some type of prescriptive contraceptives. An estimated 93 percent of
HMOs cover at least one prescription contraceptive, and about 40 percent cover all five of the
most commonly used methods: the pill, diaphram, IUDs, Norplant and Depo-Provera. The plans
that participate in FEHBP are fairly representative of most plans: 90 percent cover some type of
contraception and about 20 percent cover all five methods. The cost of requiring plans to cover
prescription contraceptives may be negligible. CBO, when assessing the Lowey amendment,
found that the cost of the coverage would be fully offset by the reduction in the cost of childbirth.

While the health benefits of contraceptive coverage are clear, the legislation raises some difficult
issues. First, the policy community usually opposes mandating particular benefits because
coverage decisions can become political rather than substantive. It makes opposing benefits
mandates that are politically popular but poor policy (e.g., a particular medical devise) difficult.
Second, Republicans would almost inevitably charge that this mandate is reminiscent of the
"micromanagement benefit design approach" taken within the Health Security Act. This
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
concern relates more to a private mandate than the FEHBP proposal, since FEHBP is a
government program and we generally have a say in defining its benefits. Third, contraceptive
coverage, like abortion, has its own set of politics that distinguishes it from other coverage
decisions. Some would argue that this calls for a greater Congressional and Administration role
than for other types of health benefits.

Taking these concerns into account, your advisors recommend that we support the Lowey
amendment but oppose or remain silent on the Snowe bill. While this appears contradictory, we
believe that there is a valid distinction between our support for the policy and our methods for
implementing it. Specifically, our policy position is that it is an important benefit that all plans
should cover, but that the best way to promote such coverage is through example (FEHBP) and
voluntary compliance (no private mandate). While this does not fully satisfy the women's
groups, it also does not completely undercut our ability to limit the extent to which the political
process interferes in benefits coverage decisions. Furthermore, we think that, with our support,
the Lowey amendment could pass, whereas the Snowe bill has very low odds of support in a
conservative Congress. Given the number of battles in Congress this year, we think that we
should use our political capital sparingly.

If you agree with our recommendations, we recommend that HHS and OPM convey this policy
                       .
position, given its sensitive nature .
