TEXT:
We're faxing you and our working group the two pager from Senate Finance:

Welfare to work: 75% of funds formula grant to states, administered by
TANF agency. No mention of substate formula, implying the governors have
discretion.  25% of funds awarded by HHS based on competition.  $100
million for performance bonus.   Use of funds like Ways and Means (job
creation, on-the-job training, contracts with job placement companies or
programs; job vouchers; job retention or support services).

Texas Privatization: Deems Texas proposal approved as submitted, and
authorizes Secretary to approve up to 10 state projects integrating
eligibility and enrollment determinations.

Legal Immigrants: The proposal starts with the House Ways and Means
grandfathering proposal, and adds in temporary benefits for the
disabled-after-entry group we are defending.  The Ways and Means costs
only $9.0 billion while the budget agreement set aside $9.7 billion. The
Senate takes that unclaimed $700 million and proposes to allow legal
immigrants in the country as of B/96 to qualify for benefits for O&a
limited period of time.OB OMB guesses that the $700 million will pay for
benefits for about 1 « years.

Technical Corrections Act/HR 1048: The proposal incorporates the House
technicals bill, minus anything related to SSDI/Social Security. This was
done so that the bill wonO,t violate the procedural firewall against
including social Security in a reconciliation bill and raise a point of ord
er. WeO,re not sure yet what O&bOB refers to (O&add a correction to the
sanction for failure to meet minimum participation ratesOB).
