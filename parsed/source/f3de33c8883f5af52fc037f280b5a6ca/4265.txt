TEXT:
Sarbanes office and in general the Dems on the Hill seem to feel good
about Treasury's preliminary regulation on EFT '99.  I think we have been
successful in our initial efforts to make this a positive issue rather
than a negative one.

One matter of concern is an ad being put out by Western Union in advance
of the final regulation promoting an EFT-type AMT card which would charge
$7.50 for every transaction! Definitely price gouging.
