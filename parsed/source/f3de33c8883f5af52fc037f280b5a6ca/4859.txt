TEXT:
Following up on our policy working group discussion last week, I would
like to suggest that we try to meet Wed. afternoon at 2pm to further
discuss the various education policy options on Elena's list.  If this
time is not good for you, please suggest another time.

One goal would be to help PIR staff understand more about what's already
in the Administration's education pipeline as well as the importance of
the FY99 budget process. Also, as PIR plans the Nov. Race Initiative
Advisory Borad meeting, which will most likely focus on education issues,
we would like to take this opportunity to better coordinate the board
members' discussions with the Administration's policy goals.

Thanks.    We look forward to hearing back from you soon.
