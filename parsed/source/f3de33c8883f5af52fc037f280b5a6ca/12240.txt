TEXT:
following this afternoon's meeting, contendors for the radio address
include:  racial profiling which, if ready to announce, has the best shot
at breaking through.   (we should consider whether it's more effective as
an event, although the calender presents a problem); cops grants which is
ripe and has local appeal and the supplemental which is a long shot but
obviously has a kosovo connection if it's ready and we want to go that
route.   what do you think?
