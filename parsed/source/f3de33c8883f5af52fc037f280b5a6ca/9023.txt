Summary of Draft Notice

The draft notice establishes that payments that meet the following three-part test will not be
subject to FICA taxes or the EITe:

       ·       The only payments the individual receives for the work activity come directly
               from the state or local welfare agency, or its contractor;
       ·       Payment is funded entirely by T ANF and/or food stamps; and
       ·       Size of the payment is limited by welfare laws; and the number of hours is limited
               by the size of the payment divided by the minimum wage.

The policy would be effective immediately. After considering public comments, the IRS would
then issue a formal regulation.

The notice is based on IRS's 1971 "general welfare" doctrine, summarized in the guidance as
"Payments by a government unit to an individual under a legislatively provided social benefit
program for the promotion of the general welfare that are not basically for services rendered are
not includible in the individual's gross income and are not wages for employment tax purposes,
even if the individual is required to perform certain activities to remain eligible for the
payments."

The guidance notes that "Due to the flexibility T ANF affords states to determine basic eligibility
rules and benefit amounts, a T ANF payment may be made both for the promotion of the general
welfare and as compensation for services. In these cases, it is extremely difficult to characterize
the basic purpose of the payments. It is also not practically feasible to determine the relative
proportion of the payment each purpose represents." The guidance then discusses how in many
cases the TANF payments are received in lieu of payments a family would have received under
AFDC and are based primarily on family need. It then establishes the three part test listed above
for those payments that will not be considered wages for tax purposes.

The ruling contains a disclaimer: "This notice does not determine the treatment or effect of
TANF payments (or regarding whether an employment relationship exists) under any other
provision of law, including the Fair Labor Standards Act."

Letter from Gerry Shea

The July 30th letter from Gerry Shea said "To the extent language has been added to address
concerns regarding potential adverse implications of the Treasury ruling, we appreciate those
efforts. At the same time, we do not believe this cures the problem, because by issuing a
directive applying the "general welfare doctrine" to T ANF payments where recipients are clearly
engaged in services, Treasury's approach still sends the message that TANF recipients engaged
in work activities are not like other workers."
