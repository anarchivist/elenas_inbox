I'm listening to it right now and it is not going well, they are very much
off message--I really wish I had gone there this morning to brief the
speakers.

Rather than talking about the partnerships and business committments, Earl
Graves attacked the President and the welfare law (the President handled
it well) and Anderson recruiters talked about the need for training and
DID NOT makes the promised jobs committment (the Presdient talked about
how gov't training program shaven't worked ..

How do I respond?   We may need to do some damage control.
