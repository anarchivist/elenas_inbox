TEXT:
I called her and asked about Gephardt and the m1n1mum wage issue. She
knew absolutly nothing about a Gephardt role in the issue; she asked
around in her office and came up dry. Gephardt is in California with the
AFL today, so my guess (and Andy's) is that he heard about the issue and
said something to the effect that everyone should be paid at least the
minimum wage.  She said she would try to call if she hears anything to the
contrary.
