TEXT:
Bill Marshall put together this outline of issues we should be tracking on
gambling, which we will send out as a follow up to last week's meeting
attendees. Bill and I also thought it might be useful to add the list of
issues the Commission must include in its final report to Congress.  I
added the list-- which is extremely broad-- but Bill wanted me to check
with you first to decide whether we should include it.  When you have a
chance, please take a look and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Leanne
