BR/EK:

Just spoke to Janet Murgia.   She wanted to know about Tuesday's event, and
whether or not we should invite/talk to Senator Brownback.   She said she's
got a pretty good relationship with him, and we may want to work him into
the event.  If not, we should at least let her know how she should
approach him before or after.

Please advise.

EK:  On a related note, I just followed up with OMB, and they say "it's
bull shit" that DOJ doesn't have the $250,000 to do the study. OMB
insists that they do, and that the $ availibility has already been
confirmed.
