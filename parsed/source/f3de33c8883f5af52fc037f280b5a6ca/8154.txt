TEXT:
I thoughttoday's poverty measurement discussion was very good and useful.

Would it be useful to sketch out a good process by which we take up the
next set of questions regarding poverty measurement before the next
Principal's meeting? Even a short (20 minute) shared conversation about
how to move forward might make it possible to give the Principals a set of
concrete ideas about next steps.                 .
