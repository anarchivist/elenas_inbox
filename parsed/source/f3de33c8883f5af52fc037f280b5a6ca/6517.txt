TEXT:
As I mentioned to Bruce, we met with the relevant agencies and there was
strong concern from that we not do this as a food safety event
Wednesday.   They argue foreign food is not unsafe and that this will
cause trade retaliation problems because foreign nations will see this as
the United States saying "beware of foreign food." USDA says trade
concerns remain Glickman's main concern. The agencies that .agreed to the
original labeling language: USDA, USTR, and Treasury also repeated that
they did not like the idea even though they had agreed to the previous
language.  We are pushing to have alternatives outlined in memo form by
the end of the week.
