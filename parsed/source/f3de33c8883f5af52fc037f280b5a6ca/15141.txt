Subject:         FYI - POTUS asked Prop 209 question

FYI - The President received a prop 209 question today at the press
conference with Chretian:

 Q    Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, today a
California federal appeals court upheld Proposition 209.  If the
state proceeds with dismantling affirmative action programs, will
that help or hinder efforts to ease racial tensions in America?

             THE PRESIDENT: Well, I believe if states are precluded
from trying to take appropriate steps that are not quotas and that do
not give unqualified people a chance to participate in whatever it is
-- the economic or educational life -- but do recognize the
disadvantages people have experienced, I think that will be a
mistake. And I think we'll all have to regroup and find new ways to
achieve the same objective.

             I think -- as you know, my position on affirmative
action is that a lot of the things that we had been doing should be
changed. I've worked hard to do that at the national level. But my
formulation of "mend it, don't end it" I still think is the best
thing for America. And so -- and that's what I said in California
during the election that people disagreed with me. But I think that
we will see that, for example, universities are better, more vital
places if they are racially and ethnically diverse.  I believe that.
And I think that it ought to be a legitimate for any university to be
able to seek an appropriate amount of diversity among people who are
otherwise qualified to be there.
