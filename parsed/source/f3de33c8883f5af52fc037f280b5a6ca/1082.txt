TEXT:
TO:                DIRECTOR FRANK RAINES
                   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JACK LEW
                   DEPUTY DIRECTOR JOHN KOSKINEN

FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      FEBRUARY 28, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


Senator Lott said today he is considering minor changes to the BBA in
order to gain passage;  he is reportedly considering an amendment to
permit capital budgeting.   Senator Daschle told reporters he might
support a revised amendment allowing for a separate capital budget -- but
"I won't support (just) any capital budget."   The unanimous consent
agreement on S.J.Res. 1 does not permit any additional Republican
amendments. Therefore, in order to offer an amendment to the BBA, Lott
would have to get unanimous consent, or Chairman Hatch would have to
report a new jOint resolution from the Judiciary Committee.

On Wednesday, March 5th, Deputy Director John Koskinen will testify before
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on the General Accounting
OfficeD,s D&high-riskD8 series, which identifies federal programs most
vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement'.
