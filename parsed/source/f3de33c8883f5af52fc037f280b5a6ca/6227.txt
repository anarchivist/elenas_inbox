TEXT:
Bruce and Elena--

I wanted to let you know that I have tentatively agreed to run the
Comprehensive School Reform Demo Program ("Obey-Porter") that the
President endorsed in a radio address this fall.   The program has a lot
of potential for addressing the President's priority of fixing failing
schools, directly in terms of the 2000+ schools likely to receive funding
under this program, and indirectly by highlighting more effective ways
that schools can use their federal funds (such as by adopting the New
American Schools designs that the Administration has invested in). Having
good models out there will be all the more important if/when we pass the
Zones or the school reform block grant proposal under discussion for
NGA.

I want you to know that I am very grateful for having the chance to work
here as part of the DPC "juggernaut" and especially during this year when
we have done so much on education.   I look forward to continuing to work
with folks here on the President's new initiatives and on things on the
horizon like the Title I reauthorization -- as well as on putting the
Administration's stamp on the.CSR program.    I will be working with Mike
on a schedule for making the transition to ED over the next few weeks.

Again, thanks for the opportunity to be a part of things here.

-- Bill
