TEXT:
Erskine made a couple more minor edits.    A couple more facts also need to
be checked.

He just expressed to me that he likes the speech a lot -- likes the format
and the substance. Just missing the news nugget.


Thanks.

       Acknowledgments and Introduction. [tk]

       I am not ordinarily the Administration's spokesperson on issues like tobacco. But I
am here today, not only as. the Chief of Staff of this Administration, but as a businessman,
as a North Carolinian, and as a parent, to talk to you about the President's plan to protect
our children from tobacco.

       Consider these facts:

              Smoking kills 430,000 people ever year -- more people than AIDS, alcohol, car
              accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and fires combined. Smoking is still by far
              the largest preventable cause of premature death in the United States.

              Nearly 90% of smokers started smoking before they turned 18.

              Nearly half ofteen daily smokers think they will not be smoking five years later--
              yet only one in five actually manages to quit.

              Every day, 3,000 young people will become regular smokers, and 1,000 will die
              sooner as a result.

       At the same time, multi-million dollar marketing campaigns have been designed to
get our children to light their first cigarettes.

              In the past months, new documents have come to light that conclusively prove
              that tobacco companies aimed to sell their deadly products to children as young as
              [ 12].

              These documents are a shocking reminder that our children are under siege by a
              deadly and powerful enemy -- and it is up to us to protect them.




                                             -1-
of President Clinton's top goals -- and this administration is fully committed to working
with the bipartisan leadership in Congress to achieve it.

              This is not a matter of politics --- it is a matter of priorities. Many Members of
              Congress from both parties have taken enormous leadership on this most
              important issue.

              Congressman Waxman has bcen on the forefront of this issue for years -- helping
              lead to the pivotal point we are at today.

              Congressman Bliley has recently done the American people a great service by
              getting thousands of pages of documents from the tobacco companies posted on
              the Internet for all the world to see.

              Congressman Fazio and Senators Conrad, Harkin, and Chaffee, have introduced
              bills we can support.

              Senator McCain has provided great leadership in the Commerce Committee to try
              to put together a bipartisan bill that meets the President's principals.

              We will not let protecting our children's lives become an election year political
              fight. It must be a national commitment.


        President Clinton has proposed a comprehensive plan that he believes -- and
experience shows -- is the best way to stop young Americans from smoking before they
start.. His plan would:

              Raise the price of cigarettes by up to $1.10 a pack over the next ten years;

              Affirm the FDA's full authority to regulate tobacco products;

              Impose strict restrictions on advertising aimed at young people; and

              Assess stiff penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.




                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                               -2-
smoking will save 1 million lives over the next five years.

              Last week, Vice President Gore announced that new estimates show that our
              proposal would have major effects on youth smoking in every state, with
              reductions ranging from 33% in Washington State to' 51 % in Kentucky.

              For every dime added to the price of cigarettes, up to 700,000 fewer teenagers will
              begin smoking and more than 200,000 premature deaths will be avoided ..

              The combination of the price increase called for in the President's plan plus the
              tighter restrictions on youth access and marketing, are projected to reduce teenage
               smoking by - ,- a year and - -%.


       Tobacco companies must be part of the solution, too.
              As the President has said, encouraging adults to smoke is legal; but tobacco
              companies must draw the line at our children.

              Our proposal requires tobacco companies to help establish smoking cessation
              programs for adult smokers, and to launch public education campaigns aimed at
              children to keep them from smoking in the first place.


       The heavy human cost of smoking to our families and communities is tragic -- and
as a businessman, I can tell you that the economic cost to our society is extremely high.

             Smoking related illness costs approximately $60 Billion every year -- that's more
             than we spend on education, child care, and medical research combined. [tk]

             Smoking during pregnancy results in 2,500 fetal deaths every year, and costs $3 to
             $4 Billion every year; -- with that money· alone, we could provide health care
             insurance to         uninsured kids. [tk]

             Fires caused by smokers cost another $500 Million every year;

             Smokers with group life insurance push up the premiums of non-smokers in their
             insurance pool by about $4 Billion every year; and

             Smokers die earlier and retire sooner -- and this is estimated to carry a cost to our
             economy in lost output, lost productivity, and lost wages as high as$60 Billion
             every year.




                                                               Automated Records Management System

hard-earned tax dollars. But if we pass the President's plan, we will take the first important
steps to reducing these costs, increasing productivity, and most important, saving lives.


       We know that this plan will be good for America -- but as a North Carolinian born
and raised in tobacco country, I can tell you that we must also take steps to make sure that
we treat out tobacco farmers fairly.

              The President made protecting tobacco farmers and their communities one of
              the five key elements for his plan for comprehensive tobacco legislation.

              We can achieve the twin goals of protecting the health of the public and
              protecting the well-being of farming communities. Recently, a remarkable
              coalition of farming groups, including burley and flue-cured growers, and
              public health groups, including the American Heart Association and the
              American Cancer Society, came together around a shared set of principles.
              That is a consensus we can build on.

              We will use some of the revenue from raising the price of cigarettes to make
              sure that we save our kids without devastating our farm communities.
              That is a commitment the Administration has made, and we are optimistic
              that a consensus is forming to do just that in Congress.


       President Clinton's balanced budget protects our children from the harms of
tobacco and our nation from the burdensome costs associated with teen smoking -- and this
budget used the very money raised by raising the price of cigarettes to invest in the future
of our nation. Our budget uses the tobacco money for:

               Critical investments in health research, including biomedical research, cancer
              .clinical trials, and children's health outreach -- increasing by nearly 50% funding
               at the National Institutes of Health.

              Historic investments in child care -- providing child care to up to [xxx] working
              families;

              Unprecedented investments in education -- reducing class size, hiring 100,000
              more teachers, building or rehabilitating 5,000 more schools;




                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
                                              -4-


           Finally, and most importantly, as a parent of three kids, I can tell you that when I
    hear the statistics I mentioned when I began, my blood runs cold.

                  And when I hear that tobacco companies have deliberately tried to get our children
                  to smoke -- despite the fact that a full third of the 3,000 kids who start smoking
                  every day will die prematurely -- I know that we must not rest until we have done
                  everything we can to protect our children from tobacco.


           We have it within our power right now to save the lives of one million kids over the
    next     years Itk]. We must not miss this historic opportunity.

                  As President Clinton recently said: "We stand on the verge of one of the greatest
                  public health achievements in history -- an historic triumph in our fight to protect
                  America's children from the deadly threat of tobacco."

                  As Chief of Staff of this Administration, as a businessman and a North Carolinian,
                  as a parent -- and as an American -- I ask you to support our efforts, and to work
                  with us in a bipartisan manner to meet this vitally important challenge.


    Thank you.

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                  -5-
