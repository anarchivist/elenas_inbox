     TEXT:
     This is not public information, but -- the President plans to use his
     line-item veto authority on the Energy and Water appropriations bill on
     Friday, October 17, probably in the early afternoon.

     Back by popular demand, OMB will hold a briefing for senior White House
     staff on the items in question on Friday, at 9:30 a.m. in the Roosevelt
     Room.  T.J. Glauthier, OMB's "PAD" in this area, will probably lead the
     briefing -- although Frank Raines will be there if he can. This is your
     opportunity to learn what the President is doing, so you can give an
     appropriate heads-up to your constituency.
