                  Q&A on National Bioethics Advisory Commission Recommendations
                                            June 4,1997

    Q.      The Washington Post reported today that NBAC will recommend a legislative ban on
    creating a child using the cloning technology that created Dolly the sheep. But the Post reports
    that the Committee won't prohibit the creation of embryos using this technology. Where does
    the President stand? Does he think we should allow cloned embryos?

    A.      The President is very concerned about using this new technology to clone human beings.
     He is deeply troubled by the prospect that it might someday be possible to create a child from
    one's own genetic material. That is why he asked NBAC to review the issue.

    The question of creating embryos for research -- as opposed to creating a child -- is a separate
    question that raises distinct scientific and ethical issues. the President has already acted in this
    area. In 1994 he directed the National Institutes of Health not to TIu).d the creation of human
    embryos for research purposes. Congress has also placed restrictions on embryo research.

    As you know, NBAC has not issued its final report, and the President has not yet reviewed their
    recommendations. We will have more to say about it after he has reviewed it.
