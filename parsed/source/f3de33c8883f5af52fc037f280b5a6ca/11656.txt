TEXT;
Paul Miller just called me about the EEOC's concerns.  He is worried that,
while the goal of the EO is to provide employees with additional
protections, a broad exemption could leave them with less protection.
They also want to make sure that the EO does not undermine their
enforcement authority under the Rehab Act, which in turn could hurt civil
rights enforcement and lead to criticisms of the Administration.

He would like the EEOC to see the CIA's proposal so they can respond to it
and have their concerns articulated in the memo to the President.   Seems
reasonable to me since memos to the Pres usually set forth the pros and
cons of any proposal so we would be doing that analysis anyway.   Paul was
going to call Elena and Chris, but I told him that I would convey his
views to you.  Paul and Peggy are leaving this afternoon for a conference
in CA, but Paul can be reached on his cell phone at ~i®l except when h              GOO~I

Sarah -- I am out of commission for much of the afternoon, so if the CIA
proposal comes in and everyone agrees that we should share it with the
EEOC, can you coordinate that?  Page me if you need me.  Thanks!
