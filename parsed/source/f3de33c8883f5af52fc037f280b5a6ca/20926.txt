  TEXT:
  Elena,
  The House Judiciary committee is scheduled to mark-up Rogers's INS reform
  bill tomorrow morning.  The DOJ has written a views letter endorsing the
. idea of separating enforcement from services (for all our reasons) but
  opposing Rogers's bill b/c it does not address the issue of coordination
  between services and enforcement and does not provide for one person
  within the DOJ responsible for immigration issues (essentially, our
  reasons for rejecting the Reyes proposal) .   This letter also references
  our legislation, that was introduced last week.   OMB, Peter and I agree
  that the letter should be sent.   please let me know by 8:30am tomorrow
  morning if you think that this letter should not be sent (I faxed you the
  draft). Thanks.

julie
