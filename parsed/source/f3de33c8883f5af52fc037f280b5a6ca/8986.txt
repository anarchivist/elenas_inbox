Q:   The Republican and Democratic proposals are not that different. Aren't you just
     playing politics with this issue?

A:   No bill is acceptable ifit excludes over 100 million Americans, and that is exactly what
     the Republican proposal does. We thought one thing that everyone agreed on was that
     all Americans should have basic patient protections. However, the Republican Senate
     proposal applies only to Americans in self-insured plans, excluding most Americans in
     small businesses and millions of other Americans from being assured these important
     protections. A recent USA Today editorial said it best: there are "100 million reasons the
     GOP health plans fails."

     Both the House and Senate Republican Leadership proposals also have many other
     weaknesses that the President is outlining today. For example, they do not ensure that
     patients can see oncologists or heart specialists when they need to; they do not limit or
     require disclosure of dangerous financial incentives for doctors to limit patient care; and
     they do not compensate patients who have suffered injury as a result of the
     wrongful conduct of health plans. Although, by any definition, the Republican
     Leadership plans fall short, the President remains committed to passing a strong
     patients' bill of rights this year, and hopeful that we will do so.

Q:   By insisting that a bill allow individuals to sue their HMOs, aren't you making it
     impossible to pass legislation this year?

A:   No. The Administration consistently has stated that a right without a remedy is not a
     right at all. The right to sue in state courts is certainly one approach, but we continue to
     be open to other meaningful approaches that ensure recourse for patients who have died
     or suffered injury as a result of wrongful conduct by health plans. If Republicans are
     serious about patients' rights, they will work with us in ensuring that patients' bill of
     rights legislation includes this kind of effective remedy.

     It is important to remember that HMOs are one of the few entities in this country that
     cannot be held accountable for wrongful actions. Americans harmed by bad apple
     physicians or sloppy manufacturers can be compensated. For some reason, current law
     prevents HMOs from being held accountable. We simply believe that is unacceptable.

Q:   Do you support the state-enforced remedies in the Democratic bill?

A:   The bipartisan Dingell-Ganske bill enforcement mechanism, which allows patients to
     bring actions against HMOs in state courts, is certainly one viable approach to giving
     injured patients an effective remedy. As we have stated before, we are open to
     considering other meaningful approaches to ensure that these patient protections are real.



                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

A:   We are open to anything that will give injured parties adequate recourse, to ensure that
     these patients' rights are real. Some have suggested allowing actions against HMOs in
     federal courts, rather than state courts. Of course, the devil is in the details, and we
     would have to inspect such proposals closely. But the essential principle is clear: when a
     patient dies or suffers harm because of a health plans' actions, the family must get some
     type of effective remedy.

Q:   Isn't this legislation going to lead to a proliferation oflawsuits? Is that really what
     we need in this country -- more lawsuits?

A:   We believe that having a strong internal and independent external appeals process in
     place will address almost all patients' grievances and that very few cases will ever make
     their way into the courts. That is why all of the independent analyses of the
     Dingell-Ganske enforcement approach have been scored as costing so little -- between a
     dime and a dollar per month.

     But it is critically important that this protection exist for the few patients who have been
     wrongfully denied care, notwithstanding the appeals process, and suffered grave harm as
     a result. Take, for example, a patient who is denied a critical mammography test
     recommended by her doctors and is later diagnosed with stage two breast cancer. Even if
     it is determined that the HMO was clearly at fault, current law provides that the patient
     can be compensated only for the cost ofthe test -- not for any subsequent treatment she
     will need and not for pain and suffering. We believe that patients of this kind, who have
     died or suffered injury because ofthe wrongful action of their health plans, ought to have
     some type of real compensation.

Q:   Some claim that millions of Americans will lose health coverage as a result of the
     patients' bill of rights. Is this true?

A.   Such claims are nothing more than scare tactics used by insurers and other special
     interests to try to stall and kill this important legislation. There are absolutely no
     independent, credible reports that these basic patient protections are going to increase
     significantly the number of uninsured.

     In fact, there are many independent analyses showing that these patient protections will
     not have a dramatic impact on the cost of health care coverage. A new analysis by the
     Congressional Budget Office shows that the patients' bill of rights will have only minimal
     effects on premiums. The CBO estimates that these protections will increase health care
     costs by $7 per month. In most cases, the cost to the individual would be only about $2
     per month.

     Also, the Kaiser Foundation has estimated that patient protections would increase
     health insurance premiums less than one percent (less than $3 per family per


                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion



         month), and another Kaiser study released last week even found that allowing patients to
         sue their health plans would only increase premiums between three and 13 cents a month.


         There is simply no reason to believe that this kind of cost of increase is going to cause
         millions of Americans to lose their health care coverage. This is why more than 150
         consumer and health care provider organizations around the nation, all of whom are
         concerned about the number of uninsured, are supporting passing a strong, enforceable
         patients' bill of rights. These organizations certainly would not be such strong advocates
         of patients' rights legislation if they thought these concerns were valid.

    Q:   What is the Administration's position on the Chafee-Graham patients' bill of rights
         proposal?

    A:   We can pass good health care legislation only when we have strong bipartisan support.
         The legislation introduced by Senators Chafee and Lieberman does represent a bipartisan
         attempt to address the patients' bill of rights issue, and we welcome it for that reason.
         The legislation is not as strong as the Dingell-Ganske bipartisan bill and we are still
         reviewing its details, but it certainly merits serious consideration. Unfortunately, both
         the House and the Senate Republican Leadership are refusing to consider any bipartisan
         approaches to this issue. We hope that the Republicans reconsider this position, so that
         we can build on the bipartisan bills offered and pass a strong bipartisan patients' bill of
         rights this year.
