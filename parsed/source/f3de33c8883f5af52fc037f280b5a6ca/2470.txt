TEXT:
The VP's interview w/ Jeff Goldberg at the New York Times went fine.

Goldberg didn't really ask any of the questions we were expecting.        He

asked the VP about the lack of momentum on the bill ... where the

Administration is .. .. if he thinks Stephen Goldstone and the other tobacco

executives are evil ... how he responds to their charges that this

legislation is all a big lie ...



I think the VP did a good job in answering these questions.        He strongly

talked about how the Administration has been pushing this for years and

that the issue is really about children (a pediatric disease).        He said he

would not get personal about his disagreements w/ Larry Tisch or

Goldstone.     He said the tide shifted on this issue as people saw the

documents and realized this is about children.     He said that we are in no

way trying to limit tobacco companies from marketing and selling to

adults.



Thanks for all of your help again.
