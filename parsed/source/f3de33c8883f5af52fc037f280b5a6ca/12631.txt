TEXT:
The Equity in Prescription Insurance Coverage is supposed to be dropped in
this Thursday. Snowe has a press conference scheduled for 11 that day.
She's invited the other sponsors but they aren't confirmed.

We may see the reversal this week of two victories won last week -- DOD
authorization subcommittee approved Sanchez amendment to allow military
women to pay for their own abortions in U.S. military hospitals;
Treasury-Postal approps. subcommittee reported out bill with Lowey
language intact in the mark. DOD Committee likely to overturn Sanchez win;
Northup may do amendment in Treasury-Postal to strike the Lowey language.

Given these new developments, we may want to seek POTUS endorsement of
EPIC this week so that we can combine it in a story about our positive
message vs. their extremism. Although, Chris and I have discussed the
benefit of holding off so that we don't have to publicly get into the
conscience clause issue yet.

FYI -- I'll be gone to a conference in Toronto from 3 pm Tuesday returning
Thursday am.
