Today the Department of Justice filed a notice in the Greensboro U.S. District Court appealing
the part of Judge Osteen's order that invalidated the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco
advertising restrictions. The Department is asking for an expedited appeal, because every day of
delay matters to our children's health. Each day, 3,000 children and young people become
regular smokers, and 1000 ofthem will have their lives cut short as a result oftheir smoking.
And this problem of youth tobacco use is getting worse. The percentage of eighth and tenth
graders who smoke has risen for four consecutive years. The FDA's common sense access and
advertising restrictions would reverse this trend.

We will continue to work to protect our children from tobacco, and we will not stop until we
succeed.
