Elena,

According to Ellen Vargyas (legal counsel at EEOC), Gingrich will be
testifying at the EEOC oversight hearing tomorrow.  Her intelligence tells
her that Gingrich will speak favorably of the President's package, but
will make a strong statement about why EEOC testing programs should not be
funded (EEOC now has one small program that has completed its "study"
phase -- i.e., how they would do testing -- and is about to implement its
first set of tests).  Ellen wants to know how strong Igasaki's statement
should be in favor of testing as a tool to identify discrimination in
hiring. My instinct is that tomorrow's hearing is not the venue to take
on Gingrich, but that Igasaki should not shy away (if asked) from stating
the Administration's (as well as the EEOC's) strong support for testing as
a tool. What do you think? Is there a leg. person that I should talk
to? Thanks.

Julie
