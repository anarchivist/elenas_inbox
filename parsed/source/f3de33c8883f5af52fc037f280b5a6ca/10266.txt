TEXT:
I attended a meeting today on a provision of the Omnib~s Appropriations
bill codifying a Reagan Administration EO that requires the Federal
government to consider how all policies and regulations affect families.
OMB is sending a memo to agencies explaining the requirements of the new
law, which I reviewed. Give me a call when you want, and I can explain
the interesting issues for OPD.
