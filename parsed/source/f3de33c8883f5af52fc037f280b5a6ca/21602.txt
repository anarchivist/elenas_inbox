     Health Care: Patients' Bill of Rights Event at AFSCME. On Monday, you are scheduled
     to participate in a roundtable discussion with health care workers and patients on the
     patients' bill of rights at the Association of Federal, State, County, and Municipal
     Employees. We are also working with a number of candidates around the country, who
     have indicated interest in downlinking this event to patients' rights rallies in their districts.
      At this event, you will receive a status report from the Vice President outlining how the
     five Federal agencies with primary jurisdiction over health care have responded to your
    ·executive order directing them to ensure that their health plans come into compliance with
     the patients' bill of rights. This report will underscore that while the Republican
     Leadership has allowed Congress to adjourn without passing a strong enforceable patients'
     bill of rights, you are taking every possible action to implement these protections for the 8S
     million Americans in Federal health plans. You can also reiterate your strong
     commitment that passing a patients' bill of rights that applies these protections to all health
     plans is a top priority for you in the next Congress. .

    Meeting With The Disability Community. Today, Justin Dart and other leaders in the
    disability community met with us to outline their policy priorities as we begin our preparations
    for the FY 2000 budget. At this meeting, they expressed their extreme appreciation for your
    support of the Jeffords-Kennedy work incentive proposal and indicated their commitment to
    working with the Administration on this and other issues of interest to the disability community.
    They were also pleased to have their opinions solicited so early in the budget process. DPC and
    NEC are in the process of exploring other work incentive and long term care initiatives that
    would provide the disabled with the health care services critical to achieving independence. We
    will be outlining these options to you in the upcoming weeks.

    Pediatric Labeling Initiative. Last year at an event with the First Lady, you announced our
    intention to release an FDA regulation that would require manufacturers to conduct the necessary
    studies to provide pediatric labeling information for physicians treating children. This
    announcement was widely praised by pediatricians and the advocacy community, especially those
    for children with AIDS. Subsequently, FDA reform legislation was passed with the intention of
    complimenting this regulation by awarding short term patent extensions to offset the costs
    incurred by companies undertaking these State studies. Since the enactment of the legislation, the
    industry has taken the inaccurate and untenable position that the legislation assumes voluntary
    and not mandatory compliance with these regulations. However, because of the industry's
    sensitivity about the regulation and their influence over the confirmation of Jane Henney as FDA
    Commissioner, the final regulation was not published. Now that Dr. Henney has been confirmed,
    the First Lady's office believes (and we agree) that we should expedite the release of the
    regulation. Although Dr. Henney strongly supports this regulation, we may want to release it
    prior to her swearing-in to assure that her first regulatory initiative is not excessively
    controversial.
