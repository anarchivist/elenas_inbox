All-Star Game Goes Tobacco Free

                       The baseball players' association agreed to a self-
imposed ban of
                        chewing tobacco at the All-Star Game. Sen. Frank
Lautenberg
                        (D-NJ) requested the ban in a letter to baseball
players' union head
                       Donald Fehr. However, Fehr said that the association
is still
                       opposed to an overall ban on tobacco in the major
leagues. "The
                       All-Star game is not a championship game, and a
player typically
                       plays for only a limited number of innings. with that
in mind, we ask
                       that all players, managers and coaches refrain from u
sing spit
                       tobacco while on the field or in the dugout, during
the course of
                        interviews, or otherwise where that use could be seen
by kids who
                       will be watching the game .    . the association will
remain opposed
                       to a ban on [spit tobacco's) use by players, while at
the same time
                       remaining firmly committed to the campaign to educate
players and
                       others about the dangers of its use."
