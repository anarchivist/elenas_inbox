TEXT:
It's only too late if we've already gotten a story. So, for example,
work-site schools will still be news (small news) because no one will
really know what it means from the line in the budget.   Americorps is a
tougher call -- probably worth a leak if we can get one.

There's always the Prisoner Work Demonstration program, although the
President will want us to save that for himself.
