 Bruce and Elena--

 Here is the latest draft of the two-pager on the Education Opportunity
 Zones.   We are circulating this for comment to key people at Education
 and internally, and may have some limited changes still to make before we
 need your final review.  We are also working on a) revised set of urban
 and rural examples of the kinds of activities supported by the initiative
 and b) internal Q&A.  Note that this version still presumes that the Zones
 will be leaked prior to the class-size initiative.

 Thanks.

                        EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY ZONES:
                   STRENGTHENING URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOLS
                         REVISED DRAFT -- January 23, 1998

       I challenge every school district to adopt high standards, to abolish social promotion, to
       move aggressively to help all students make the grade through tutoring, and summer
       schools, and to hold schools accountable for results, giving them the tools and the
       leadership and the parental involvement to do the job.
                                                         -- President Bill Clinton, October 28, 1997
HELPING . STUDENTS IN HIGH POVERTY COMMUNITIES REACH HIGH
ST ANDARDS. President Clinton's Education Opportunity Zones initiative will help strengthen
public schools and help students master the basic and advanced academic skills where the need is
the greatest: in high poverty urban and rural communities where concentrated poverty, low
expectations, too many poorly prepared teachers, and overwhelmed school systems create
significant barriers to high achievement. The Education Department will select approximately
fifty high poverty urban and rural communities with: (I) a demonstrated commitment to use high
standards and tests of student achievement as tools to identify and provide help to students,
teachers and schools who need it; (2) programs to end social promotion and tum around failing
schools; and (3) evidence of improved student achievement. Added investments in these
communities will accelerate their progress and provide models of successful, standards-based
reform for the nation. The President's initiative would invest $200 million in FY99, and $1.5
billion over 5 years, in raising achievement and sharing lessons learned with school districts
around the country.

A CLEAR FOCUS ON HIGH STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR RESULTS.
To be selected as Education Opportunity Zones, school districts will have to demonstrate how
they will address some key aspects of effective local reform efforts: · holding schools
accountable for helping students reach high academic standards, including rewarding schools that
succeed and intervening in schools that fail to make progress; · holding teachers and principals
accountable for quality, including rewarding outstanding teachers, and fairly and quickly
removing ineffective teachers; · ending social promotions and requiring students to meet
academic standards at key transition points in their academic careers; and · providing students
and parents with school report cards and expanded choice within public education.

EXTRA RESOURCES TO IMPROVE TEACHING, LEARNING, AND LEADERSHIP.
School districts will use Education Opportunity Zone funds for key activities such as: ·
providing extra help to students who need it to meet challenging standards, through after-school,
Saturday, and/or summer school programs; · providing bonuses to schools that make significant
gains in student achievement; · turning around failing schools by implementing proven reform
models, or closing them down and reconstituting them or reopening them as charter schools; ·
building stronger partnerships between schools and parents, businesses, and communities; ·
implementing sound management practices and accountability systems; · providing intensive
professional development to teachers and principals; · helping outstanding teachers earn master
teacher certification from the National Board for Professional Teacher Standards and giving them
bonuses when they do; and
· implementing programs to identify low performing teachers, assist them to improve, and
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

remove them if they fail to do so.
COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO SUPPORT PROMISING MODELS. Districts will be
selected as Education Opportunity Zones under a competitive, peer-review process. A mix of
large and smaJler urban areas wiJl be selected to participate, as weJl as rural school districts and
consortia. Each urban Education Opportunity Zone will receive a 3-year grant worth up to
$10-25 million per year (depending upon size and proposed activities), and each rural Zone could
receive from $250,000 to $3 million (for consortia). Zones wiJl be selected in two rounds, the
first in FY 1999, and the second in FY 2001. Successful applicants will have broad-based
partnerships to support their refonns -- including parents, teachers, local government, business
and civic groups, institutions of higher education and other key stakeholders. Successful
applications will show how the district will use aJl available resources -- federal, state, and local,
as weJl as any business or foundation funds -- to carry out its refonn strategy and maintain it once
these federal funds are no longer available. Eligible districts often have substantial numbers of
disabled and limited English proficient children, and successful applications will address how
these children will be assisted to meet high standards.

REWARDS FOR DEMONSTRATED STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GAINS.                                          Each
Education Opportunity Zone wiJl agree to a rigorous perfonnance partnership with the Secretary
of Education, agreeing to set specific, ambitious, benchmarks in student achievement, dropout
rates and other indicators of success. Districts may receive further support in years 4 and 5 only
if they have demonstrated success in reaching the agreed benchmarks.

GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN USING OTHER FEDERAL RESOURCES. AJI schools in
an Education Opportunity Zone school district -- regardless of poverty level -- will become
eligible to combine aJl their federal education funds, together with state and local funds, in
schoolwide programs to raise student achievement.            Requirements pertaining to school
accountability, as weJl as special education, health, safety, and civil rights, wiJl continue to be
met.

ASSISTANCE TO HELP DISTRICTS FIND AND SHARE WHAT WORKS. The
Department of Education will offer technical assistance, use technology to help districts consult
with each other, and disseminate lessons learned to urban and rural communities across the U.S.
 In addition, a national evaluation of the Zones wiJl be conducted, with the results helping to
infonn the next reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

BOLD ACTION TO HELP CHILDREN IN OUR CITIES AND RURAL AREAS.
Education opportunity zones are part of a broader set of initiatives to help strengthen urban and
rural schools. President Clinton has proposed a national campaign to rebuild crumbling schools,
a $350 miJlion initiative to recruit and prepare teachers for underserved urban and rural areas,
and a dramatic commitment to expanding the availability and quality of child care and
after-school learning opportunities. These and additional proposals still to be announced wiJl
have a powerful impact on improving the prospects of children in some of our poorest
communities.
