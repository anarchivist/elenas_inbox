     it is possible that the Washington Post (branigan) will have a story
     tomorrow on H1B. The Reps. may have come to a compromise and may bring a
     bill to the floor next week.  Peter J. is trying to get a copy of the
     legislation. Attached is a q&a to respond to inquiries about the
     compromise leg.  thanks.

                            Question & Answer on H-IB visas
                                      July 24,1998


Q:   We understand that the Republicans have reached a compromise on H-IB
     legislation. Is the Administration going to support this?

A:   We have not seen any new legislation and would need to look at the details of their
     proposal before commenting on whether we will support it.

     On the substance, our position has been clear: in order for the President to sign a bill that
     increases the cap on H -18 visas, it must contain both a significant training component
     and meaningful refonn to the H-18 program that ensures that employers recruit U.S.
     workers before applying for an H-IB worker and not lay-off a U.S. worker in order to hire
     an H-I 8 worker.


Q:   Was the Administration a player in the creation of this compromise?

A:   Over the last several months, we have had discussions with various members of Congress
     to ensure that efforts to increase the H-18 visa cap are coupled with additional training
     and protections for U.S. workers.
