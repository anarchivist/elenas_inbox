TEXT:
We now have legislative language from Haskins on his proposed "compromise"
on FLSA. DOL is looking at it.    It appears to say what we expected --
workfare only has to be as many hours as the state can afford, and the
balance of the hours can be filled with job search and education;
FICA/FUTA don't apply to workfare; checks can still come from the welfare
office. The key unknown is whether they have weakened labor protections
at all, and it's hard to tell.   I'm faxing it to you in case you want to
look at it personally.
