                          PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
                         REMARKS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE
                           CONFERENCE ON HATE CRIMES
                       THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY
                                 November 10, 1997

       Acknowledgments: VP Gore; AG Reno; Sec. Riley; Sec. Cuomo; Members of Congress;
President Trachtenberg; Chuenee [shuh-NAY] Sampson, Duke University student; 1000s of
people at satellite-linked conferences all over the country.

       America is the world's most diverse democracy, founded on a basic belief in the dignity
of every human being, and bound together by a basic respect for the laws that preserve our values
and keep our people safe. Our families can only thrive if they are free from the fear of crime and
violence. And we must do everything we can to give them that security.

        That is one of the reasons we decided to hold the White House Conference on Hate
Crimes. All over the world we see what happens when racial and ethnic animosity join forces·
with lawlessness, tearing countries, peoples, and families apart. But even in America we hear
too many stories like the 13-year-old African American boy nearly beaten to death when he rode
his bicycle through the wrong neighborhood ... the gay American murdered as he walked home
from work ... the Asian American who lost her store to a firebomb hurled by a racist ... or the
Jewish American whose house of worship was desecrated by swastikas ... and too many more.

       These violent acts are not just despicable examples of bias and bigotry -- they are
crimes. They strike at the heart of what it means to be American, because they are the
antithesis ofthe values that define us as a nation: Freedom. Equality. Respect for the
law. And respect for one another.

       Last year, I called on all Americans to begin a great national conversation on race -- and
to come together across all our differences into one America. We know that we can only fight
prejudice by fighting the misunderstanding and ignorance that produce it. And part of what I
hope we can achieve is a national affirmation of what we all know to be true: violence motivated
by prejudice and hatred hurts us all -- and we must fight it on every front.

        First, we must make sure our nation's laws protect all of our citizens. Our laws already
punish crimes committed against people on the basis of race, religion, and national origin. But
we must go even further. Today I am proposing to expand the principal federal hate crimes law
to include crimes committed because ofthe victims' sexual orientation, gender, or disability.
All Americans deserve protection from hate. And as President Harry Truman said 50 years ago,
"when I say all Americans, I mean all Americans." I am especially pleased that Senators Specter
and Kennedy will soon introduce legislation to achieve this goal -- legislation I will fight to make
the law of the land.
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

            Second, we must make sure our civil rights laws are consistently and vigorously enforced.
     Under Attorney General Reno's leadership, the Justice Department has taken aim at hate crimes,
    with more prosecutions and tougher punishments. Starting today, every United States Attorney
    in the country will establish or expand working groups to develop enforcement strategies, share
    best practices, and educate the public about hate crimes. This national hate crimes network will
    marshal the resources of federal, state, and local law enforcement, community groups, educators,
    and anti-violence advocates -- and it will give us another powerful tool to fight hate crimes.

             I am also pleased to announce that we will assign over 70 more FBI agents and
    prosecutors to work on hate crimes enforcement. And the Justice Department will make its own
    hate crimes training curriculum available to state and local law enforcement training centers
    around the country. Finally, the Justice Department and HUD are launching an important new
    initiative to help victims of housing-related hate crimes sue their attackers for the harm they
    cause.

            When it comes to enforcing civil rights laws, we need strong leadership. I nominated Bill
    Lann Lee to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice because he will provide
    that leadership. The son of Chinese immigrants, Bill Lee has seen the damaging force of
    discrimination, and he has dedicated his career to fighting for equal rights, without regard for
    ideology or political party. I urge Congress to give Bill Lee a fair vote by the full Senate.
    Partisan politics should never stand in the way of confirming the best qualified candidate -- and
    they must never stand in the way of the enforcement of our civil rights laws.

             Third, we know that for many reasons, too many hate crimes go unreported -- and an
    unreported hate crime is an excuse to ignore the problem. I am pleased to announce that for
    the first time, the National Crime Victimization Survey used by the Justice Department to
    measure nationwide crime levels will include questions about hate crimes. This small addition will
    yield large results, giving us a better measure, of the number of hate crimes, and increasing what
    we know about how they occur.

            Finally, and perhaps most important, we must teach our children that to be an American
    means to respect the dignity of every human being. That is why I am so pleased that the
    Education and Justice Departments will distribute to every school district in the country a hate
    crimes resource guide. This guide will direct educators to materials they can use to teach
    tolerance and mutual respect in our schools. And today the Justice Department is launching a
    website where younger students can learn about prejudice and the harm it causes.

            With these steps, we are drawing the line against hate crimes and !he people who commit
    them. And we are sending a message to the world that in America, we will not tolerate disrespect for
    our laws, for our people, or for our ideals. In America, we truly are one people, one nation, under
    God
