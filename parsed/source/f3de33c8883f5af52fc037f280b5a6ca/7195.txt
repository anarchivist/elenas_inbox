 MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

 From:              Sandra L. Thurman
                    Director, Office of National AIDS Policy

 Re:        Recommended Call to Dr. Scott Hitt

 A meeting was held earlier this afternoon with Bruce Reed, Elena Kagan,
 Chris Jennings, Maria Echaveste, and others to discuss some actions in
 response to community concerns about needle exchange.  Part of the
 strategy developed was for a series of phone calls to be made to key
 constituencies to discuss the AdministrationD,s decision.

 we would appreciate it if you would call Dr. Scott Hitt, Chair of the
 PresidentD,s Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.  Dr. Hitt has been publicly
 critical of the decision (see attached). We believe the message to Dr.
 Hitt should be as follows:

 1.      The scientific determination made by the Secretary was an
 extremely important step in gaining local approval for needle exchange
 programs.
 2.      In the final days before the announcement by the Secretary, it
 became increasingly clear to us that a decision to provide funding would
 have cost us support on other key AIDS programs and was not likely to
 survive threatened Congressional attempts to make the funding ban
 permanent.
 3.      We are going to look at some of the other ways in which the
 Administration can be more supportive of local folks making decisions
 around needle exchange. We are also going. to see what we can do to
 ratchet up our efforts on drug treatment.

 If you would like to discuss any of these further, please donD,t hesitate
 to contact me.
