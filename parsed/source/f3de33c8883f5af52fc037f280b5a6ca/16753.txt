 TEXT:
 Seattle--Mayor Norm Rice will call Sen. Murray, and wants to be helpful in
 other ways. We should think about his calling some members of Black
 Caucus.

 Philadelphia--we will ask Mayor Rendell to call Chaka Fattah, Sen.
 Spector, Sen. Santorum

 Atlanta--Mayor Campbell could be helpful with Black Caucus, and Senator
 Cleland. Don't know if it's worth his making other calls to the two House
 members from Georgia on the committee and Sen. Coverdell.

 Los Angeles--unknown if Mayor Riordan will weigh in on this, but will make
 the call to him.

 Long Beach--Mayor O'Neill is a very enthusiastic supporter, and we'll ask
 her to call her two Senators and other California members you all decide.

 Fresno--Mayor Jim Patterson--need to scope him out.

 Omaha--Mayor Hal Daub is a former Republican Congressman, and it's not
 certain what his level of commitment is on standards, but we'll call him
 and ask him to talk to his Senators.

 Houston--Mayor Lanier will be asked to call both Senators.

 San Antonio--Mayor Howard Peak will be asked to call Senators.
·   ·

        EI Paso--Mayor Carlos Ramirez--depending on where he is on the standards,
        he could be extremely helpful with Hispanic Caucus.

        Detroit and Michigan--Since we have both the city and the state, we are
        asking Governor Engler to reach out to Senator Abraham and to the three
        Republican House committee members. We should think of additional ways to
        involve Mayor Archer.  We will ask him to call Abraham as well, but he
        could be very helpful with the Caucus, and Dale Kildee.

        Cincinnati--We will ask Mayor Qualls to talk to both Sens. Dewine and
        Glenn.

        Chicago--We will ask the Mayor to call Sens. Moseley-Braun and Durbin.    It
        might also be worth asking him to call John Porter.

        Broward County Florida--We are calling the Chair of the County Commission,
        as well as the mayors of Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale. We'll ask them to
        call the Senators.

        New York City--we need to think through how we approach the mayor (if we
        do) and what we ask him to do. We believe him to be supportive of the
        standards.
        States:

        Michigan--see above

        North Carolina--we are asking Gov. Hunt to talk to   Congo Ballenger.

        West Virginia--We'll ask the Governor to call his Senators

        Kentucky--We'll ask the Governor to call his Senators.l

        Delaware--We'll ask Gov. Carper to call Congo Castle.

        Indiana--Gov. O'Bannon has expressed interest in the standards. If he is
        on board with us, we will ask him to talk to Roemer, Souder and McIntosh.

        Maryland and Massachusetts--we can ask Govs. to talk to Sens., but will
        hold on this for now.
        In addition, Mickey will call Hispanic members of the Committee--he has
        already talked to Becerra, who is definitely opposed to the tests.

        Lynn can call Lynn Woolsey, Dennis Kucinich, Patsy Mink, Dale Kildee,
        George Miller, and, if needed, Don Payne and Harold Ford, Jr.
