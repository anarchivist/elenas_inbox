  TEXT:
  Today, Jack Lew told Barbara Chow and other OMB staff he doesn't recall
  the definition of unsubsidized employment (excluding employment subsidized
  by WTW funds, but not employment subsidized by TANF or other funds) being
  part of the deal he agreed to with Bruce  (see history below). OMB
  intends to tell DOL to proceed with publication of the guidance on the WTW
  performance bonus with the narrower definition of unsubsidized employment
  that DOL and OMB prefers, unless Bruce wants to call a meeting with Jack g
  nd Kitty.

  This means we would reward job entry only into totally unsubsidized jobs
  and not give states any credit for placement into jobs that were
  subsidized by TANF funds.

  Here are the best arguments I've got for our position:
  1) statute says the bonus formula should measure "success of states in
  placing individuals in private sector employment of in any kind of
  employment, through programs operated with funds provided under [$3
  Billion program]."

  2) given that this is a one-time bonus to measure performance in FY 1999,
  defining success so narrowly may un~erstate the performance of the program
  and jeapordize public support.
  For example,  Philadelphia has designed an innovative transitional work
  initiative which blends the TANF funds administered by the state welfare
  agency and the WTW funds flowing through the state to the local PIC.  TANF
  funds would be converted from a welfare check to a paycheck for hard to
  serve people working in 25 hour/week wage-paying transitional jobs for 6
  months while they gain skills, work experience, and credentials. They
  will be on the payroll of a non-profit intermediary. WTW funds will be use
  d to pay for 10 hours/week of job training, job readiness/job search etc.
  Participants continue to get child care, transportation, and medicaid
  through the welfare agency. After no more than 6 months, the intermediary
  will place people in unsubsidized jobs. Under DOL/OMB's approach,
  placements in these transitional jobs would not count towards the bonus,
  and it's highly unlikely most people would make it into the unsubsidized
  jobs in time to count toward this one time bonus.

  3) The TANF High Performance Bonus does give credit for subsidized and
  unsubsidized jobs, as long as subsidized jobs are not 100% subsidized (so
  as to rule out workfare type jobs, but rule in grant diversion/wage
  supplementation type jobs), and we were hoping to have the WTW and TANF
  bonuses as close as possible.



 4) It's unrealistic to expect a WTW agency to track whether someone is
 getting a subsidy from TANF agency at the time they count as a job entry
 under WTW -- not that we don't expect them to coordinate, but there are
 timing and tracking issues that will get complicated.

 5) And, of course, the President likes subsidized employment and one of
 the purposes of the $3 billion was to create jobs through private and
 publicly subsidized employment.

 Don't cave.    We had a deal, and these OOL people are silly.

 Subject:         WTW Performance Bonus

 As part of Bruce and Jack's deal regarding how to reward high performance
 in the OOL WtW program, we agreed to reward only unsubsidized employment,
 defined as employment not subsidized by WtW funds (Bruce's reply to Jack,
 copied below, even made that distinction).  See note below for why we
 thought it made sense to include jobs subsidized by TANF or other funds.
 OMB staff say OOL staff say Kitty Higgins is furious about this decision,
 and may call one of you to protest.  It appears Jack may not have been
 aware of the distinction when he agreed to the deal, and his staff is
 siding with OOL.   Everything else has been agreed to.

 I suggest we wait to see if Kitty really does call or if they're just
 bluffing. Alternatively, we could cave.

 We think it's very clear from Bruce's note to Jack that the agreement to
 reward unsubsidized employment excluded only wage subsidies paid with WTW
 funds.  Following our July 2nd meeting with agencies, we never had any
 reason to believe that subsidies paid with non-WTW funds were even an

  issuue. At that meeting, we questioned how a WTW agency would be able to
  track subsidies paid by non-WTW funds and DOL said they envisioned only
  excluding subsidies paid with WTW funds.   We are willing to hold the PIes
  responsible for knowing whether or not they are paying a subsidy; it gets
  much more complicated to expect them to know if someone is getting a wage
  subsidy from another source, i.e. what counts, for what period, and what
  happens if status changes from subsidized to unsubsidized in the middle of
  a quarter.

  Subject:         DOL High performance rule

  I think your offer makes a lot of sense.   We'll go along with your
  proposal to reward unsubsidized employment (i.e., exclude wage subsidies
  and OJT paid with WTW funds)·, if you go along with setting the threshold
  for the 2nd job entry measure at 30 hours, not 20; and the overall
  weighting at 60% job entry (40% job entry, 20% substantial job entry) and
  40% retention/earnings gain (25% retention, 15% earnings gain) .    .

  Thanks for resolving this.   We'll calIon you to settle the next baseball
  strike.
