The Honorable Arlen Specter
Chainnan
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services,
  and Education
Committee on Appropriations
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510-6025

Dear Chainnan Specter:

Thank you for your letter regarding child labor restrictions on Amish youth working in
sawmills, and urging an administrative approach to addressing this issue rather than
legislation.

As you know from our conversations on this matter, we share deep respect for the cultural
and religious traditions of the Amish and similar communities, and recognize the good
intentions of efforts to accommodate these traditions.

However, we have equally serious concerns that the legislation which has been proposed,
if enacted, could result in exposing young workers to extremely hazardous workplace
conditions in sawmills and the wood processing industry. This industry has an
occupational fatality rate nearly five times higher than the national private-industry
average. In addition to the serious dangers posed by milling and wood working
equipment, the Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has many
examples of sawmill workers who were crushed by falling loads, or run over by front-end
loaders or fork-lifts. These serious dangers are exacerbated for young workers. The
Department of Justice also has serious concerns about the constitutionality of the House
legislation as set forth in their September 1998 letter to the Subcommittee.

Since this issue first arose as a result of the Amish community entering new commercial
business ventures in which they employ their children, the Department of Labor has
repeatedly offered to work with the Old Order Amish to help them comply with the child
labor laws and develop employment opportunities for their young that do not place them
at risk. Many of those efforts were outlined in my July 1, 1998, letter to you. Among
these efforts, we carefully examined two proposals to allow 16-and 17-year-olds to work
in sawmills under certain conditions. Our review ofthese proposals, which included
on-site visits to operating sawmills in Western Pennsylvania, detennined that the
proposals would not adequately protect young workers; their health and safety would still
be at
                   2                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

great risk. In addition, as a practical matter, the proposals would not have afforded the
Amish with the accommodations they seek to employ their youth.

I should emphasize that the proposals we considered addressed the potential employment
of 16-and 17-year old youth in sawmills. These proposals did not encompass the
potential employment of 14-and 15-year-olds - as the Old Order Amish community seeks
- because the law specifically prohibits the employment of youth under 16 years of age in
manufacturing, which includes sawmilling and furniture manufacturing.

Clearly, the Department shares your constituents' belief that work experience can be
beneficial for young people. We remain most willing to work with the Old Order
Amish, and you, to try and find a reasonable solution, but our principal obligation under
the law is to ensure that the health and safety of young workers are not compromised.

                                        Sincerely,


                                        Alexis M. Herman
