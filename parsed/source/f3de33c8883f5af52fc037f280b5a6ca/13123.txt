TEXT:
I agree with your edit.  If you send me edited versions, I'll have
Correspondence prepare these in final (azure paper, etc.).  If you
have a handy copy of the memo that went up to President with his
comment on it, I'll enclose that with the signature copies and
send them up to him on Wednesday.  thanks
