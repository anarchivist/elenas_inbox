Subj ect :         Unbanked

I checked with Treasury about whether there is an opportunity here and
found that they think and I agree that the downside outweighs the upside.

When they announce their rule on implementing the Electronic Funds
Transfer (which forces folks to use direct deposit) they will announce
ideas for banks to create accounts that will be simple for those without
accounts to get and use.  The AARP and other groups are not happy with the
implementation of the EFT (we have to do by law) because old people like
to take their check to the bank once a month.   And while the proposals to
help with accounts are good, they don't feel they are enough.
