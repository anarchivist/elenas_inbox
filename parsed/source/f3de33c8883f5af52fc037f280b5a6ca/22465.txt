TEXT:
Laura Nichols of Gephardt's staff called to say that they expect to be in
next week and were we thinking of an event ? We discussed Wednesday as
possible. Patients Bill of Rights and Minum Wage have been introduced;
PBofR seems the best bet .
   What do we think ? Want to look for another Lazarus ?
