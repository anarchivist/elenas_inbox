                    PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
          REMARKS FOR WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON CHILD CARE
                          THE WHITE HOUSE
                           OCTOBER 23, 1997

          Six years ago today, I went back to my alma mater at Georgetown and began a series of
speeches outlining my vision for America -- how we could keep the American Dream alive for
all our people, maintain American leadership for peace, freedom and prosperity, and come
together across the lines that keep us from truly being one America.

             Together, we've made much progress toward this vision. At the threshold of a new
century, our economy is thriving, our social fabric is mending, and we've led the world toward
greater peace and cooperation. This has happened in no small part because of a new philosophy
about the role of government. Today, government is smaller and more focused on working in
partnership with its citizens, on giving all Americans the tools they need to solve their own
problems.

        And that is why we're here today. If we are going to keep our families strong in the next
century, if we want to keep living in an America that honors our values as it brings greater
prosperity to all people willing to work for it, then we must bring more Americans the tools they
need to fulfill their greatest promise as workers and as parents.

        Child care is the next great frontier in social policy in America. It is the way we
will help parents succeed at home and at work. No parent should have to choose between
work and family, between putting food on the table and providing good care for their
children. Nothing is more important for families than rmding child care that is affordable,
accessible and safe. That must be our mission today and that must be America's mission
in the years and months to come.

        Time and technology have fundamentally altered the way we live, work and do business.
But the toughest, most rewarding and important job in the human experience remains the same --
that of being a parent. As the Catholic Conference has noted, no government can love a child
and no policy can substitute for a family's care. But there is much that all of us can do to help all
parents meet their duties to their children -- even as the demands of work and the expectations of
society shift all around us.

        From my days as Governor of Arkansas to my days as President, strengthening families
has been a central goal of my public life. The first bill I signed into office was the Family and
Medical Leave Act so that no parent has to choose between caring for a loved one or keeping a
job when a family member falls ill. But we didn't stop there. The expanded eamed income tax
credit ensures that parents who work do not have to raise their children in poverty. Our
expanded Head Start programs are now serving more families than ever before. We have
collected record amounts of child support, making sure that more parents take responsibility for


                                                 1
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

their children. The historic balanced budget I signed this summer provides a $500 per child tax
credit and helps parents save or pay for their children's college educations through tax free IRAs,
expanded loans, grants and other tax credits.

         We have also made much progress on child care. Since I came to office, child care
assistance has increased by nearly 70 percent, helping families pay for care for one million
children. Last year, we fought and won the battle to expand child care assistance as part of
welfare reform. This new funding -- $4 billion over six years -- has given states an unprecedented
opportunity to be leaders and innovators in our efforts to make child care more affordable to the
working poor. Ifwe expect all welfare recipients to go to work, then we must help them get the
quality child care that will make work pay ... that will enable them to leave their children in care
that is safe and secure.

        But we must do more. Today there are more pressures on working families than ever
before. More families must rely on two incomes to make ends meet. More children come
home to empty homes after school. And we now know from recent brain research that how we
care for our children in their earliest years can have lifelong consequences. Stable and
stimulating care can lead to stronger academic and social skills, build self-esteem and a capacity
for trust and relationships. For children in high-risk environments, quality care in the earliest
years can mean the difference between a life full of hope and accomplishment or one diminished
by crime, difficulty at school, and despair.

       That means that first and foremost, we must do everything we can to give children more
time with the people who matter most -- their parents. I am working to expand the Family and
Medical Leave Act so that parents can take time offfor their children's medical appointments,
teacher conferences and other family duties. And I am supporting flex-time laws that will allow
workers to choose to receive overtime in payor in time off to be with their families.

        But we also must make sure that during those times when children can't be with their
parents, they get care that keeps them safe and helps them learn and grow. Unfortunately, our
child care system is failing too many families. Too often, child care is unaffordable,
inaccessible, or even unsafe.

        Child care costs strain millions of family budgets, draining as much as a quarter of a
working family's income, while government assistance meets just a quarter of the need. And
even for those who can afford it, good child care is often hard to find. Waiting lists take months
or years to move, forcing many parents to cobble together unstable child care arrangements. The
child care shortage puts older children at risk, as well. Today, five million children between the
ages of five and fourteen are left to fend for themselves after school, increasing the chances that
they will try drugs, alcohol and tobacco or be victims of crime.

        Finally, studies have shown that many child care arrangements are unsafe. The tragedies
that have befallen families who depend on child care continue to make headlines across America.


                                                 2
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

 We must make sure that no more families suffer such needless heartbreak.

        This conference is an important step toward addressing all of these problems. What we
learn today should spur us to find ways to help all parents afford the type of safe, high-quality
child care that best suits their needs -- whether it's at home, a child care center, or a neighbor's
house. In the coming months, my Administration will develop a plan, which I will unveil in my
next State of the Union and budget, to improve access and affordability and help assure the safety
of child care in our country.

        In the meantime, I am announcing four new actions we can take today. First, I am
establishing a new scholarship fund for child care providers. Too many caregivers do not have
the training they need to provide the best care possible for our children. Those who do have
training are rarely compensated with higher wages. The scholarship will help students earn their
degrees in exchange for a promise to remain in the child care field for at least one year and
require states to make sure that caregivers who do complete their training are rewarded with a
bonus or a raise.

         Second, we must weed out those people who have no business taking care of children in
the first place. I am transmitting to Congress the ''National Crime Prevention and Privacy
Compact" which will enable states to share criminal histories for a few specific purposes besides
criminal investigations, including background checks on child care workers. I urge Congress to
pass and states to ratify this legislation.

        Third, I am asking Secretary Rubin to oversee a working group on child care. I am
charging the group, composed primarily of business leaders, to work with labor and community
representatives to find ways businesses can provide child care to their employees or help them
afford high quality child care. It's good business to help employees gain the peace of mind that
comes from knowing their children are well-cared for while they are at work. Few people can
give 100 percent to ajob when they are worried about a child's safety.

         Finally, we must use community service to strengthen and expand access to after-school
programs. Today, the Corporation for National Service, through its "To Learn and Grow
Initiative," will pledge to help after-school programs across the country use volunteers to provide
better care to children. And it releasing a "How-To-Manual" for groups who want to
incorporate community service into after-school programs.

        For centuries, the American Dream has represented a fundamental compact between all
Americans: Everyone who works hard and plays by the rules can build better lives for
themselves and their families. For too many Americans, child care that is too expensive, usafe,
or unavailable has become stubborn a obstacle to that Dream. Let us commit ourselves to
clearing this obstacles, to helping parents fulfill their most sacred duty -- raising strong, healthy
and moral children. Only then can we keep the American Dream alive for them and for
generations to come.
