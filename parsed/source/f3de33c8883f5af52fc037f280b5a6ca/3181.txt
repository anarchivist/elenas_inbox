On Thursday, both the House and the Senate passed the spending portions of the budget. While
most of the health provisions in both bills are consistent with the budget agreement, there are
some notable exceptions that are either flawed policy or are inconsistent with the agreement.


MEDICARE. The Senate passed Medicare provisions represent the most drastic departure
from our vision: It includes: an income-related premium, phasing in the Medicare eligibility age
from 65 to 67; a new home-health copayment; and the elimination of balanced billing protections
for at least the new private fee-for-service options. The income-related premium begins at
$50,000 for a single and $75,000 for couple and is fully phased in at $100,000 ($125,000 per
couple). When fully phased in in 2002, it would cost beneficiaries three times as much as other
beneficiaries. We have policy concerns about the provision including that it is difficult to
administrate and that it could potentially cause high-income beneficiaries to opt out of Medicare,
leaving poorer beneficiaries in a weakened Medicare program. On the positive side, the Senate
severely limited the MSA demo to 100,000 and your academic health center payment pool was
preserved. In the House, this pool was not preserved and MSAs were much broader (500,000).
However, none of the other problems in the Senate were included.


MEDICAID. There are three major concerns with the Medicaid provisions. First, the House
and Senate have dramatically different approaches to reducing DSH spending -- both of which
differ from your policy. Your policy is the best at assuring that the few high-DSH states do not
bear a disproportionate amount of the cuts. However, there are arguments on all sides about the
best way to approach this reduction. Additionally, we are concerned about giving states the
funds for premium assistance for low-income Medicare beneficiaries through a Medicare block
grant versus Medicaid. Finally, neither the House or Senate fully restore the funding for DC and
the territories that the budget agreement called for.

CHILDREN'S HEALTH. The children health provisions are far better than the House-passed
bill. In fact, its required benefits package and cost-sharing protections are strong enough to
merit a generally positive reception by most of the children's advocacy community. The bill
also includes an additional $8 billion for children's health grant program. The House bill is
disappointing in that it does not meet our criteria for well targeted, meaningful benefits for
children. It allows states to allocate these dollars for services rather than coverage and which
will result in less numbers of children becoming insured. Moreover, even when a state does
allocate its dollars to health insurance, its health benefit package is much-less defined than the
Senate-passed bill and certainly does not meet our requirement for meaningful benefits. Neither
the House nor the Senate bills cover the SSI children who are losing coverage due to tightened
eligibility rules, a provision whic'h was clearly included in the budget agreement. Finally, the $.20
tobacco tax passed by the Senate raises an additional $8 billion for children health care coverage.
 The questions that remain are can it be retained in conference and will the remaining $6 billion
(on top of the $8 billion raised by the $.20 tax) be dedicated to children's issues, such as adoption
and child care or other investments, such as a certain tax policies, that the Administration does
not support.
