TEXT:
Please disregard-toss-recycle the Commerce / Justice / State
Appropriations draft SAP that I circulated to you last night.  The Rules
committee canceled their consideration of the bill this morning, and do
not plan to take it up until September. We'll do another run then.

Thanks for being ,so consistently responsive in clearing our SAPs and
letters! More to come in September ...

Alice
