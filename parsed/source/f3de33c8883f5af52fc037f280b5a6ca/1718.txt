     Attached is a rough draft of Q&A for the hiring initiative.  I'm sure this
     will change after tomorrow's 8:30 a.m. meeting, especially if we decide
     not to release numbers.  However, if you could both read over this and
     suggest additional questions that come to mind or alterations to existing
     Q&As, I'd appreciate it.

                                      Q&A
               The Federal Government Plan to Hire Welfare Recipients

Question:   Hiring 9,437 welfare recipients over four years seems ambitious. Are these figures
            realistic?

Answer:     This is an ambitious plan and it is a testament to the leadership and creativity of
            this Administration's Cabinet. However, you must remember that these numbers
            are preliminary estimates and may go up or down depending on future budgets as
            well as the success of agency outreach and retention plans and other factors such
            as the strength of the economy.

Question:   Why have some agencies set specific numerical targets while others have not?

Answer:     The directive asked agency and department heads to each prepare an
            individualized plan for hiring welfare recipients that included a survey of where
            jobs exist within each agency. Some agencies have set target numbers as
            motivating devices. Others have decided that it is too early in this stage of the
            process to set numbers and have, instead, developed extensive outreach and
            recruiting plans.

Question:   What sort of hires are included in the 9,437 figure?

Answer:     All agencies have surveyed their existing hiring capacity and have reported
            available entry-level positions through all existing hiring capacities including the
            Worker-Trainee program the President encouraged them to use. The 9,437
            number refers only to those who would be hired directly by the Federal
            government. Additionally, many of the agencies will be encouraging their
            grantees and contractors to hire welfare recipients, thereby further increasing the
            number of recipients likely to be hired.

Question:   How are you going to hire welfare recipients at a time government is downsizing
            and budgets are tough?

Answer:     It is true that the government has been downsizing. Since the President took
            office, he has actually reduced the White House workforce by XXX%. Other
            agencies have similalrly reduced their workforces. However, downsizing does not
            mean that there are no jobs to fill. As in any organization, there is a natural
            amount of tumover injobs at all levels. The Federal agencies have surveyed
            current vacancies and have committed to reaching out specifcally to the welfare
            population to fill those positions.

Question:   How many Federal employers are there and what percentage of the workforce


                                              1
            does that represent?                                Hex-Dump Conve:sion

Answer:     There are 1.9 million Federal employees that account for 1.5% of the nation's
            workforce.

Question:   How much will this effort cost?

Answer:     This effort should not cost anything. All personnel offices conduct recruitment
            and outreach as part of their normal activities and build in these necessary
            activities as part of their normal budgets. Essentially, we are expecting agencies
            to carry this out within their existing budgets.

Question:   Will agencies be hiring only in Washington, D.C.?

Answer:     No. We're talking about jobs all over the country. More than 85 percent of
            federal jobs are located outside the Washington metropolitan area.

Question:   The White House has over 1,500 employees. Why is the White House hiring only
            six recipients?

Answer:     The White House is ready to hire six welfare recipients now. Once the White
            House program is in place and the initial six are hired, we expect to continue to
            hire more.

Question:   In which departments will the White House place the first six welfare recipients?

Answer:     One of the first welfare recipients will be placed in the Domestic Policy Council.
            Others will be placed through the Executive Office of the President.

Question:   Aren't you favoring welfare recipients over everyone else?

Answer:     We are not creating any preference such as the one that exists for veterans. We
            are encouraging the departments to use an existing hiring authority that allows
            departments to cut through red tape and hire entry-level workers quickly and
            easily. We are also encouraging outreach efforts. This is the same commitment
            that the President has asked of the private sector.

Question:   Why are we specifically helping welfare recipients rather than other poor people?

Answer:     We make no apologies about the fact that we are asking the agencies to hire needy
            single mothers with children. These are the people whom it is most crucial to
            reach and put on the track of work. We want to help these families move from
            dependence on welfare to independence through self-sufficiency.

Question:   Now that the agencies have turned in their plans, what are the next steps?

Answer:     Agencies will begin working right away to fill available jobs by reaching out to
            welfare recipients to notify them of those jobs, and to fully use the existing
            programs to help recipients take and keep the jobs.

Question:   Why did it take the Administration so long to get its hiring program off the
            ground?

Answer:     The Federal hiring process is full of complex rules and regulations. We sat down
            and looked at all of these rules to find the best way through them. We discovered
            an existing track of hiring authority -- The Worker-Trainee Program -- that would
            allow agencies to hire entry-level people quickly and easily, without all the usu!ll
            hurdles. Additionally, we have encouraged the agencies to use other existing
            hiring authorities to tap into this labor pool. We are thrilled that so many of the
            agencies presented us with creative and ambitious plans that show their
            commitment and leadership to the pressing issue of moving welfare recipients
            permanently into the workforce.
