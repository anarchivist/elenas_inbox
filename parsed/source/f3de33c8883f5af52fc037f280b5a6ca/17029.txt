TEXT:
I just completed reading the Sept. 19 memo to Erskine regarding our
Conference Strategy for National Tests. Good job. One additional item I
mentioned at our strategy meeting which was not. reflected in the memo is
the idea of advancing the School Drop-out Bill which will be introduced by
Sen. Bingaman and Rep. Hinojosa which the President recognized in his
speech last Tuesday night to the CHC. Hinojosa is the education chair of
the CHC. Like school construction for the CBC, perhaps this could be a
vehicle for addtional support for testing. I think it is worth a try.
