TEXT:
This e-mail lists ideas for Executive Orders relating to tobacco which we
are pursuing.   (The attached chart describes agency policy on filming
privileges on federal property, mentioned below.) Any feedback on these
ideas would be greatly appreciated.

1)      Applying the FDA Rule to Federal Property -- An Executive Order could
apply the FDA rule to Federal property, by directing agencies that
contract with entities operating on Federal land to include provisions in
their contracts requiring compliance with the FDA rule.  HHS likes this
idea, and we plan to ask Justice to draft language for an Executive
Order. We would also need to run this idea by Interior, DOD and other
agencies that regulate federal property.

2)      Prohibiting Underage Smoking on Federal Property -- DOJ is determining
whether there is statutory authority to issue an Executive Order making
underage smoking on federal property illegal.   There would be no penalty
for violations, other than confiscating the tobacco product. Justice
likes this approach, but HHS is concerned about the way it would play in.
the press (they think ·the press would make fun of the idea). HHS also
does not like anything that appears to punish minors because they believe
it is ineffective in deterring youth smoking.

3)      Smoking and Filming privileges on Federal Property
        (a)  Prohibiting the Filming of Movies on Federal Property that Promote
Smoking -- As you know, Senator McConnell said on the Senate floor that he
would offer an amendment to the McCain legislation which would require
federal agencies to prohibit the filming of movies on federal property
which D&depict the use of tobacco or illegal drugs as healthy, deSirable,
or socially acceptable.DB He also said that the President could issue an
Executive Order to this effect. McConnell does not target the portrayal
of youth smoking, but smoking in general.

        We met yesterday with the Justice Department and the various
Federal agencies which allow filming on federal property (Departments of
Defense, Transportation (Coast Guard), Interior (Park Service), and
Agriculture (Forest Service»  to learn more about their policies and
procedures for granting filming rights, and to elicit their views on the
McConnell amendment. As you can see from the attached chart, their
policies and procedures vary a great deal.  For example, while the Park


Service is explicitly prohibited from examining content in granting
filming rights (they only seek to protect park resources and visitors),
the DOD and the Coast Guard look closely at content. While the process
for granting filming rights is very centralized for some agencies, it is
very decentralized for others (ie. operating on a park by park basis) .

        All of the agencies raised objections to the McConnell amendment.
The Park Service said that McConnell would directly contradict their
policy which prohibits them from examining content. A number of agencies
expressed strong concern about this route being a slippery slope, that
could result in prohibiting the portrayal of other behavior (gay
relationships, etc.), down the road.  The DOD asserted that if they
started engaging in this type of censorship, production companies would go
elsewhere and D&they would be out of business.DB Of course, some of the
agencies are concerned about the administrative burden involved with
reviewing thousands of scripts in this kind of detail.

        The Justice DepartmentD,s initial reaction is that McConnellD,s
amendment raises First Amendment constitutional concerns because it is not
viewpoint neutral.   (They also privately expressed concern that current
agency practice in granting filming privileges could be potentially
unconstitutional as well.) They are in the process of researching the
issue. They also want to explore whether we could regulate this type of
speech because it results from a form of government subsidy (under Rust v.
Sullivan), although they think this may be a stretch. They plan to give
us an answer to these questions by the end of the week.   The Supreme Court
is expected to decide a case on Thursday or Friday on the National
Endowment for the Arts which could shed some light on these questions,
particularly in terms of free speech and government subsidies.

         (b) Prohibiting the Filming of Movies on Federal Property that Portray
Illegal Smoking - We have also asked the Justice Department to explore
other alternatives to the McConnell amendment that would be viewpoint
neutral, such as narrowing McConnell to prohibit the portrayal of illegal
youth smoking. We will let you know what they say as soon as we hear from
them.

4}      Requiring OSHA to Issue a Standard on Environmental Tobacco Smoke
OSHA has been working on a standard for almost a decade which would
regulate indoor air quality, including ETS, LegionnaireD,s disease, etc ..
The standard is still several years away from completion. The President
could issue an Executive Order directing OSHA to issue the ETS standard
separately. OSHA believes that it would take two years to issue the ETS
standard -- less time than completing the indoor air quality standard.
OSHA is writing a memo providing us with the pros and cons of this
approach.  (A BNA reporter called OSHA about this today, because ASH is
pushing the idea. OSHA had no comment.}==================== ATTACHMENT     1 ========
