TEXT:
The event is scheduled for the East Room at 11:30am on Monday, October 5.
The press office would like to leak the HHS Report on the problem of elder
abuse to the NYT or USA Today and to the morning shows. They would also
like Shalala to go out that morning on the shows.

The audience will be 150 seniors, advocates, and State AGs.  Lynn Cutler
suggested we invite Kirk Douglas to be in the front row. Does that, sound
okay to you all?

The VP is not confirmed yet, but will likely participate. The outstanding
question is whether or not the Reno and Shalala should speak. I f they all
speak, the messages could be:

VP - Administration Accomplishments
Shalala - Overview of problem of elder abuse (from the report)
Reno - Overview of problem of elder fraud, specifically telemarketing fraud
Victim of telemarketing fraud - tells her story
POTUS - Outlines his commitment/federal role and makes his announcements
(1. Call for reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, 2. Creation of
National Center on Elder Abuse, 3. Announce DOJ/AARP partnerships to crack
down on elder fraud, 4. Announce new DOJ grants on elder fraud)

Let me know if you think it's better not to have the Cabinet speak. Thanks.
