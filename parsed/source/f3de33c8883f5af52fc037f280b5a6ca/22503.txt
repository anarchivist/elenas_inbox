TEXT:
John and I talked, and new news we could leak to the paper for the Mayor's
Conference are the numbers on HUD's budget for FY2000, are reintroduction
of the Low -Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) expansion, and the $50
million abandoned buildings initiative.  I sent a LIHTC paragraph to Laura
to add into the document for the Mayors and John is drafting one on
abandoned buildings.
