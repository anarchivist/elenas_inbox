TEXT:
I think you are off for the blue skies. The gender preference executive
order should be ready for review on your return, and we have some new
issues that might support some of your projects that we can meet with you
on when you have time next week. The only possibily time dependant
start-up project is the civil rights review which you asked us to think
about taking on.    If you have time, perhaps we could talk about it on
Monday, or if you have time from the road.
