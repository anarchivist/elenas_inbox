    PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- ROMAN
    LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS
    A legislative package developed under Option 3 would contain the
    following elements:
    a)    Geographic and temporal scope: We understood the provisions
    of Section 2001(k) to require the release of sales previously
    offered under the provisions of Section 318, a rider attached to
    a 1989 appropriations bill. Those sales were defined by both
    specific geographic and temporal boundaries and were subject to
    environmental requirements provided for in Section 318.       Indeed,
    the common way of referring to this part of the timber rider in
    the Rescission Act had been "the 318 sale provision".
    Judge Hogan's recent decision in NFRC v. Glickman dramatically
    changes that universe by requiring the release of all timber
    sales on Forest Service and BLM lands in the geographic area
    covered by ?318, regardless of whether they were actually offered
    under Section 318.       The injunction issued by Judge Hogan
    requires the release of all timber sales in the geographic area
    after the expiration of ?318 to the date of the signing of the
    rescissions bill, and the scope of the declaratory judgment
    covers all timber sales offered by the Forest Service and BLM
    prior to the passage of ?318.     Purchasers of sales that did not
    proceed for environmental or other reasons prior to the passage
    of ?318 are now coming forward to claim rights to such sales.
    The proposed amendment would conform the legislation to our
    original understanding of the geographic and temporal scope of
    this provision.    This amendment would have no effect on sales
    that we have already released. The practical effect of the
    change would be to prevent release of sales that had been
    withdrawn prior to the passage of      .
    ?318, as well as clarifying that certain sales currently in
    dispute do not fall within the parameters of this legislation


unless they were truly "?318 sales."
The proposed amendment would amend section 2001(k) (1) to clarify
that the sales subject to release are those "subject to and
consistent with" Section 318 of Public Law 101
o
-12l.
b)   "Known to be nesting": The only exception to the release of
sales mandated in Section 2001(k) is for sale units in which
threatened or endangered bird species are "known to be nesting".
There are a few northern spotted owl nests in sale areas, but the
controversy regarding this issue revolves around a number of
sales that containing marbled murrelet breeding habitat. Marbled
murre lets are a seabird which breed in coastal forests and have
extremely elusive nesting habits. Several Administrative
initiatives, including the Forest Plan and proposals to provide

relief to private landowners under the Endangered Species Act
could be at risk if these sales are released.
While there was clearly disagreement between Congress and the
Administration .about the definition of "known to be nesting"
during the legislative debate, no statutory definition was
ultimately adopted.   Industry plaintiffs are suing the land
management agencies at present to force the agencies to use a·
very narrow definition of "known to be nesting". The land
management agencies are relying on the best scientific protocol
for determining where murrelets are "known to be nesting". Our
proposed amendment to Section 2001(k) (2) would [change the
standard from "known to be nesting" to "occupy for nesting or
breeding purposes] [explictedly authorize the agencies to rely on
the current and best science as developed in the Pacific Seabird
Protocol] .
c)  Protecting the President's Forest Plan:   Our understanding of
Congress' intent was that the timber rider in the Rescissions
bill shielded the President's Forest Plan.   However, the attorney
representing industry plaintiffs in most of the litigation
falling under Section 2001(k) has signalled his belief that
Congress specifically overrode the Forest Plan in the Rescission
Rider and that Section 2001(d)  refers to timber sales in the
geographic area of the Plan, but not to the Plan itself.
Further, Section 2001(1) specifically prohibits the
Administration from revising or amending the Plan to take into
the account changes in the environmental baseline caused by green
timber sales under Section 2001(k).   In other words, it requires
the land management agencies to assume trees that have been cut
are still standing. This prohibition puts the Forest Plan at
serious risk of being overturned by the courts.
Our proposed amendment would modify Section 2001(d) to clarify
that the provisions of this section apply only to timber sales
that conform with the requirements of the President's Forest
Plan. The amendment would also delete the prohibition in Section
2001(1) that constrains needed modification to the Plan.
d) Securing Necessary Administrative Tools:    Notwithstanding our
proposed amendments, under this option, the government ·would
still have to release certain timber sales under Section
2001(kl). Currently, the only environmental rationale for
withholding sales it the "known to be nesting" bird provision in
those instances, the government is obligated to offer replacement
timber of equal volume, kind and value subject to the terms of
the original contract for that replacement timber.    The Forest
Service in particular believes it is extremely constrained in the


 amount of alternative timber it has available. We have developed
 several administrative tools which, if authorized, would give the

 agencies flexibility in modifying or terminating sales,
 exchanging other kinds of timber configurations for harvest
 rights under Section 2001(k) or buying back (essentially,
 condemning) vested harvest rights.
 Our proposed amendment would authorize the Secretaries to
 suspend, terminate or modify any of the timber contracts falling
 within the scope of Section 2001(k) where the Secretary finds
 that such termination or modification is necessary pursuant to
 the original contract terms (Forest Service contracts already
 carry modification and termination language for environmental
 issues) or to otherwise avoid damage to the environment or public
 resources.   It would also authorize the Secretary to settle any
 claim by a contractor through compensation or exchange of timber
 sale contracts.    (This authority could extend to sales under the
 Forest Plan, if so desired.)
 e)   "If for any other reason":   Currently, Section 2001(k) (e)
 requires the Secretary to provide replacement timber of like
 volume, kind and value "if for any reason" a sale cannot be
 released and completed          "While the only affirmative
 defense to the release of a sale is the "known to be nesting"
 provision of Section 2001(k) (2), there are cases of physical
 impossibility and there may be other circumstances beyond the
 agencies' control which could arguably require the agencies to
 offer replacement timber under this provision., This creates a
 further unanticipated burden on the agencies to provide scarce
 replacement timber (particularly under the district court's
 interpretation covering pre-?318 sales.)
 OUnder our prol?osed amendment, the "for any reasons" language in
 Section 2001(k) (3) would be deleted and the requirement to offer
 replacement timber would apply only in instances in which the
 agencies invoked Section 200l(k) (2) ..
