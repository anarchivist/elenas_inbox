                   Federal Welfare-to-Work Hiring Program
                           Thursday, April 9, 1998


     I'm pleased to be here today to make an important announcement about our

progress in hiring people off welfare and into available jobs in the government -- to

do our share to replace welfare checks with paychecks.

     Before President Clinton and I took office, only two years out of the previous

sixty saw the welfare caseload drop more than a quarter million. Now we are

about to have our third straight annual decline of more than one million, for a total

drop of 4.3 million since January of 1993. This performance is so far out ahead of

any previous administration's that if it were a footrace, no one would have the time

to wait and see who finished second.

     Our philosophy on welfare reform is simple: most people on welfare want to

be productive members of society, but they have been locked in a system with all

the wrong incentives.   We've changed all that. By working with the states, and

by passing a national welfare reform law, we have made welfare a second chance,

not a way of life. But that means we must do everything we can to make sure

welfare recipients can find work.

     That's why President Clinton and I have launched a comprehensive initiative

to help welfare recipients find and keep good jobs.   Our plan includes welfare to

work grants, housing vouchers, transportation grants, and mentoring programs.

We're offering states a big bonus for moving more people into work.     But most

importantly, we have helped mobilize the business community to hire welfare

recipients through our Welfare-to-Work Partnership, which now boasts 3,000

employers.

As part of that initiative, the President asked me -- one year ago -- to spearhead an

effort to hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients into available jobs in the

government by the year 2000.




      I am delighted to announce today that federal agencies -- in the past year --

have hired more than 3,600 former welfare recipients.

In other words, we are less than one-third of the way toward our deadline, and

more than one-third of the way toward our goal.



     We owe thanks to our agency heads, and to the federal employees involved in

recruiting, mentoring and training. But we especially owe our thanks to the

former welfare recipients themselves.

Everyone knows the zeal of a new convert -- whether it's someone who just found

the joy of personal renewal through physical exercise, or a healthy new diet, or

giving up tobacco. The employers who have hired welfare recipients have found

that this same spirit of self-renewal animates people who re-discover the virtue and

satisfaction of a hard day's work. Their enthusiasm is infectious, and they can

often boost the morale of the entire office just by their willingness to work and

their eagerness to learn.

      That's a big reason why business members of our Welfare-to-Work

Partnership have been making commitments to hire welfare recipients:          they are

productive, they have low turnover, and they come with tax incentives.         The fact

is, hiring welfare recipients is not an act of charity; it is an act of economic

self-interest.

     And now our business partners are sharing that message. In a meeting with

the Welfare-to-Work Partnership late last year, I learned from Gerry Greenwald

that United Air Lines and a lot of the other partners have had great success

encouraging their contractors and suppliers to hire former welfare recipients.

     Our efforts in Reinventing Government have taught me never to overlook a

good idea from the private sector, and so I passed this idea on to our agencies.

They have pursued innovative approaches to encourage federal contractors and

suppliers to hire welfare recipients, and based on the early results of their efforts, I

am convinced it is something we should do all across the government.

     Therefore, I am asking every federal agency to encourage their contractors

and suppliers to join us in a voluntary effort to recruit, mentor, and train welfare

recipients, and help us accelerate our efforts to move people from welfare to work.

 Together, we can make responsibility a way of life, all across America.

     Now, I'd like to begin a brief discussion with our panel to hear about the

successes of private businesses and federal agencies in putting welfare recipients to

work '"



Question for Janice Lachance, Director of OPM

Janice, what are the basics of making the welfare to work program succeed in

OPM?

Question for Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor

Alexis, I know job retention is key in the success of moving people from welfare to

work. Based on what you heard on your tour, and what you're doing in your own

agency, what retention strategies do you recommend?


Question for Mort Downey, Deputy Secretary of Transportation

Mort, what are the transportation challenges faced by those moving from

welfare to work - and what can we do to address them?

Question for Jim Sines, Vice President, United Airlines

Jim, United Airlines has already done what I'm asking federal agencies to do -

you've urged your contractors to get involved in welfare-to-work. Tell us how

you did it, and how it's working?



Question for Lillie Bedney, currently OPM employee

Lillie, now that you're such a success at OPM, what are your plans for the future?
