TEXT:
I understand you have received AG Reno's recommendation on DEA's policy on
"assisted suicides". Oregon voters have twice voted a state policy on
this subject - by overwhelming margins, and, as a result, Governor
Kitzhaber is very interested in the subject. He has written us a few times
(I'll forward the letters if you are interested) and would like his views
taken into account and - at least - pre-notified of our decision.
