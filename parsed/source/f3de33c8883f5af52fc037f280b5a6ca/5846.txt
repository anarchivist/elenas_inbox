TEXT:
You have received an invitation to speak here (as yet undetermined
conference room) on Monday, January 12 at 3:00pm by Mark Pelavin of the
Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.  They are bringing in leading
rabbis from allover the coutry from Reform, Conservative and
Reconstructionist congregations. They will be coming to Washington to
learn about social action issues and how to effectively advocate for these
issues.

If Monday does not work for you, please let me know because they may be
able to switch their time over here. This is a good, intelligent group of
religious leaders that I would highly recommend if your schedule allows.

Thanks for your consideration.   Feel free to call me at 65157.
