[Sent by FAX to Palast, Uhalde, Tarplin/Burdette, Barr]

Here's a first quick shot at what a Performance Fund might look like.     For
comments: My fax is 395-7752; phone -- 395-4532.

Elements:

Funds come from the reallocations.   Or:

we could put in   1% off the top of each year's appropriation as well, or

we could add to the Performance Bonus Fund $200 million derived as
follows:   For FY 2000, reduce the amount for regular grants to $700
million (the same as 1998 and 1999); add $100 million to 2001 so it is the
same $700 million level as 1998-2000, and make $200 million available to
the Secretary beginning in 2000, by which time there will be performance
to reward.


Thoughts?

Rewards are to States for their use of formula grants, or to recipients of
competitive grants or to Indian grantees.

Rewards are for placements of the bill's Required Beneficiaries (30
months; within a year of termination; the "2 of 4" folk), except that as
in that clause, 10% can be for placements of other welfare recipients.

Placements are 9 months (as in Daschle) and only for non-subsidized jobs
(public, private, or non-profit), except that tax credits are okay.

Amounts are what the Secretary says, with the assumption of $1,000 per
placement, if the Sec thinks there's enough money.

Extra credit for placments that result in incomes that move individual off
welfare and for doing good in high unemployment areas.

As in Daschle, Bonus funds can only be used to support more Welfare to
Work, are not matched, and can't be used to match other Federal programs.

[Insert on page 16 after line 13]

"(d) PERFORMANCE FUND -- The Secretary shall make performance bonus grants from the
Performance Fund to recipients of competitive and non-competitive grants under paragraph (a),
and Indian tribes or organizations which receive grants under paragraph (b), whose use of such
grants results in the highest level of qualified placements of qualified individuals eligible for
assistance under Welfare to Work Grants made available in this section.

       "(I) The Performance Fund shall be financed from:

               "(I) funds allocated to States for non-competitive grants for which a State does not
               apply, or for which a State does not qualify, and which are returned to the
               Secretary in accord with subparagraph ???;

               "(II) funds made available to States in non-competitive grants, and to eligible
               applicants in competitive grants which are not spent in accord with the State's or
               applicant's plan, and which are returned to the Secretary in accord with
               subparagraph ??

       "(ii) Qualified individuals are those who meet the definition of Required Beneficiaries
       under section (5)(C)(ii) [ref. Page 10], except that not more than 10% of those for whom
       a State or other grantee applies for a performance bonus shall be other than those who
       meet the qualifications of (5)(C)(ii)(I)-(III).

       "(iii) Qualified placements are placements of qualified individuals in jobs in the private,
       public, or non-profit sectors

               "(I) for which no funds under this part, no other Federal funds, and no State or
               local government funds, are used to subsidize in whole or in part the
               compensation or benefits received by the individual from the employer; and

               "(II) which the individual has held for at least nine months.

       "As used in this clause, the term "Federal funds" does not include tax credits received by
       an employer as a result of employing an individual for whom a qualified placement is
       made.

       "(iv) The Secretary shall announce a competition for Performance Bonus Grants
       whenever the Secretary determines that there is a sufficient amount of funds available in
       the Performance Fund to make Performance Bonus Grants of meaningful size.
       Applications for such Grants shall be made at such time and in such manner, and


                                                 1
                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


containing such infonnation, as the Secretary shall detennine and announce at least 90
days in advance of the application deadline. Perfonnance Bonus Grants shall be made to
those applicants who document the highest level of qualified placements. Applications
must, at minimum, demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction how the applicant has
detennined that the level of qualified placements resulting from Welfare to Work Grants
is in excess of the level that is occurring by virtue of use of basic TANF grants.

"(v) The amount of a Perfonnance Bonus Grant shall be calculated at $1,000 per qualified
placement, except that the Secretary may reduce the amount per placement consistent
with the funds available.

"(vi) The Secretary shall give priority consideration to Perfonnance Bonus Grants to
applicants who document that their Welfare to Work programs have resulted in the
largest number of qualified placements whose wage level, as defined by the Secretary, is
an amount, sufficient on its own or in combination with Food Stamps, to make the
individual and her family independent of public assistance.

"(vii) The Secretary may give priority consideration to applications that demonstrate high
levels of qualified placements in areas of high unemployment.

"(viii) Perfonnance Bonus Grants may only be used to add to the grants received by the
recipients under subsections (a) or (b), except that no matching requirements shall apply
to Perfonnance Bonus Grants and such Grants may not be used to meet the matching
requirement of Welfare to Work Grants or any other Federal program.
