 Q:      What is the President's response to the Patient's Bill of Rights
 legislation that is presently being             marked up by the
 Senate Labor Committee?

 A:       The legislation Senator Jeffords intends to markup today falls
 far short of what is necessary to meet the needs of
 patients in a rapidly changing health care system.   It will not cover tens
 of millions of Americans; it will not have a             standard to
 prevent HMOs from making arbitrary coverage decision; and it will have a
 wholly inadequate                        mechanism to enforce patients'
 rights. This helps explains why every major patient, doctor, and nurse
 advocacy                 organization has concluded that the Chairman's
 mark is flawed and will not adequately protect patients.

         Clearly, we are disappointed that the Democratic substitute bill
 did not receive a majority vote yesterday. We           remain
 hopeful, however, that the legislation will be improved as the legislative
 process proceeds. We hope the           Committee will approve
 strengthening amendments on the Senate floor when the entire public is


 focused on a          debate   of the issues at stake.
