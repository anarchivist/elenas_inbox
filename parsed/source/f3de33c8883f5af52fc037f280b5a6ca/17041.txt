TEXT:
October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and Ann Rosewater called me
to tell me that they are meeting internally with Kevin Thurm tomorrow to
discuss a domestic violence report they want Secretary Shalala to transmit
to the President. The report describes the Administration's
accomplishments and lays out the HHS agenda for 1998. On Sept. 30th HHS
will be giving out grants for shelters -- with something like a 52%
increase in funds (Ann didn't have the numbers on hand, but that's what
she remembered) .

They think that, with the grants as a hook, this could be a good radio
address. Ann thinks that it's important that we continue to be proactive
about our accomplishments and commitment to domestic violence issues in
light of the criticism we've gotten for not supporting an exemption from
the welfare reform work rates for this population. Keep in mind that the
Senate Labor-HHS bill has the Murray-Wellstone amendment so this will be
an issue in conference (she recommends we stay silent in any SAP on the iss
ue to avoid inflaming the groups)

Once they see Kevin tomorrow, she hopes to ship over a draft report.
