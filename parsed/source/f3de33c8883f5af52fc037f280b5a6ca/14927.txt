     RE:                     Two Upcoming CEA Reports

     DATE:           Tuesday, March 18, 1997


             Michelle Jolin of CEA just told me about two upcoming CEA reports which may be
     useful for March-April events. She is interested in any guidance on how and when to release
     them (and is also discussing this with Bruce).

              1. Welfare Reform. By the week of 3/31, CEA will be ready with a report on the
     factors that have reduced the nation's welfare caseloads so dramatically in the past four years.
     They will conclude that about 50% was due to the strong economy, and 50% due to other factors,
     including our state waivers (which may account for roughly one-third of the reduction).
     Apparently, the President has already been told about this report and is very interested in it. It
     could serve as a "What Works" guide for states (or literally be turned into such a guide). Since
     it will almost definitely show that our approach is the right one, we may want to consider having
     the porus highlight it through a Radio Address or other event.

             2. Investments in Children Aged 0-3. By the week of April 14th (right before the
     Early Childhood Conference), CEA will be ready with a report on investments in children aged
     0-3, including health and mental health programs/investments. It will essentially be a
     cost-benefit analysis pointing out the importance and cost-effectiveness of investing in young
     children. While it will not contain hard news, we could release or mention it as part of another
     event to lead-in to the Conference.

             Please let me know if either of these are of interest.
