     PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
     STATEMENT ON THE EDUCATION
     THE WHITE HOUSE
     October 9, 1998

             Good afternoon.  I have just had the opportunity to meet with
     Senator Daschle, Representative Gephardt and their colleagues. We have
     been discussing the course of the budget on Capitol Hill. And we stand
     united in insisting that Congress act immediately to pass a budget that
     honors our values and meets AmericaO,s priorities by investing in the
     education of our children.

             This is a year when we should be able to make real, bipartisan
     progress. We have created the first balanced budget and surplus in 29
     years. Our economy continues to be strong, creating jobs and broadening
     prosperity, despite economic turmoil abroad.  We have an opportunity to
     maintain our fiscal discipline while making the investments we need.   We
     can sustain this American economic renaissance.



        This budget is a test of whether we will act together, putting
progress over partisanship to advance the natIonal interest. Above all,
it will test whether we will widen the circle of opportunity and invest in
our children by strengthening our schools for the 21st Century.

        I am determined that our budget will make a strong down payment on
our drive to reduce class size by hiring 100,000 new, highly trained
teachers. Today, there are a record number of children in our schools,
and studies confirm what every parent knows: smaller classes and better
trained teachers makes all the difference.  We have a duty to act.

         Smaller classes and more teachers demands more classrooms. All
across America, children are being forced to learn in school buildings
that are crowded or even crumbling, and are not wired for the 21st
Century.   I have asked the Republican majority to act on an innovative
plan to help communities modernize or build 5000 schools. We can do this
without a big new spending program; we can do it with targeted tax cuts --
and I canO,t think of a better tax cut for our countryO,s future.

           This balanced budget should meet many other educational priorities
as well.

        It should fully fund after-school programs, to bring discipline
and learning into the lives of our young people. Most youth crime takes
place between the hours of three and six PM. We can give young people some
place to go beside the streets.

        This budget should press forward to bring cutting edge technology
to the classroom, with teachers trained to use it.

        This budget should expand Head Start so that more of our children
can reap the benefits of learning in the earliest years.

        This budget should teach our children to read through childhood
literacy, and support our new mentoring drive to encourage young people to
go to college.

        And I believe we should move forward with voluntary national
standards in the basics.  We certainly shouldnO,t move backwards from the
standards we already have. So this budget should fully support Goals
2000, to help communities meet high standards.

        In all these ways, and more, we can act for our children.
Unfortunately, when the education investment bill was finally brought to
the House floor yesterday, eight days into the fiscal year, it met none of
these challenges.   I have instructed my budget team to return to Capitol
Hill, make the case for our educational priorities, and fight for our
childrenO,s future.   I am confident we will prevail.
