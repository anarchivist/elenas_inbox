TEXT:
HERE'S A DRAFT MEMO I'LL SEND WHEN WE'RE READY WITH #'S:

In order to make the case for our new initiatives, we will need to present
more detail to OMB and others about what they entail. By mid-week, I
would like to be able to show them one-pagers on each significant
initiative.  This will help us get the $ we're asking for, and force us to
think through all the wrinkles of what we're doing.  It will also force
others to do the same for their initiatives, which may not be as well
thought through.

We don't need a lot of rhetoric -- just nuts and bolts about what the
money would go for and how the initiatives would work, and what it would
enable the President to say in the State of the Union   (e.g., 500,000 kids
in afterschool programs; 100,000 people a year in Americorps by 2001;
etc.). Please get drafts to Paul and Elena by mid-day tomorrow.

Here's our list (all #'s are above passback).  It adds up to $2.174
billion, not counting the crime bill. We could easily squeeze it down to

from AIDS, 25m from food safety) .
