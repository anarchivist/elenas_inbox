Irene:

I don't think our q/a should say that we had 1,000 border patrol agents in
the budget, but decided to knock them out. That only adds to Gregg's
suspicions that we/the White House may have sacrificed border patrol for
COPS -- and gives easy cover to INS.  Instead, we should affirmatively
make the point, as you do, that we have dramatically increased border
patrol; that we need new technologies, etc.; and -- as Doris included in
her testimony -- that nearly 40% of the border patrol has less than 2-3
years on the force (check this).  This last point is important because it
plays into all of the integrity and ethics issues. Experience shows that
law enforcement agencies that staff up to quickly, short-cut training and
screening, or have too many inexperienced officers are bound to have
problems.

Q: Is the Clinton Administration diverting money that should go to hire more 1,000 Border Patrol
to expand the local cops-on-the-street program?

A: INS did request funding for more than 1,000 Border Patrol for FY 2000. However, as part
of the budget process and review of the various options with the INS, it was determined that it is
wiser to assimilate and train the current historic high levels of border patrol agents and to target
additional funding to expand critical technology and invests in infrastructure to support Border
Patrol enforcement efforts.

Currently, the U.S. Border Patrol has nearly 9,000 agents. This historic level has doubled since
FY 1993 and is 28 percent higher than President Clinton's goal of7,OOO agents by the year 2000.
 The FY 2000 budget expands critical technology and invests in infrastructure to support Border
Patrol enforcement efforts.    For example,

·      INS will deploy 176 Remote Video Surveillance Systems, a force-multiplying technology
       which provides the capability for monitoring the border from remote sites; and

·      more than $70 million is included for Border patrol and detention construction projects,
       including 20 new or upgraded Border Patrol stations.

    For FY 2000, the Clinton Administration has requested $4.27 billion, an 8 percent increase over
    the FY 1999 funding levels. The budget would add a total of306 new staff positions, which
    allows INS to grow to 31,240 positions by the end ofFY 2000.

    The INS budget for FY 2000 continues to support the immigration goals and strategies that the
    Administration and the agency have effectively pursued over the last several years. At the same
    time, the FY 2000 budget marks a year of consolidation, as INS focusing on managing the
    resources gained during an period of unprecedented growth for the agency.

    The thrust of the FY 200




    Border Patrol growth has ... less than two years

    Measured growth is wiser
