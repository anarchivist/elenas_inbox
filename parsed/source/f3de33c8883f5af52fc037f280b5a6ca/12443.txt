    ANNOUNCEMENT

    NSC, OSD, DoD, State folks just had a quick call to discuss a last-minute
    change in plans for bringing Kosovar refugees into the US.  Sec'y Albright
    would like to move people out more quickly than processing people in
    Macedonia would allow.  We'll have to use Ft Dix to process the first 500
    (combination of "vulnerables" and relatives) refugees, afterall.   We are
    aiming to have them arrive by Tuesday, 5/4.

    Sec'y Albright will make a general announcement (no specification of
    dates) of these Ft. Dix plans at 12:30pm today during   a
                                                            war crimes press
    conference.

    Brian Atwood and Julia are tentatively SCheduled to do a more detailed
    announcement at 3:30pm today.

    Attendees were assigned to make calls to Torrecelli, Congressional
    delegation, Gov'r, and local officials.

    TENTATIVE TIMELINE

    INS. team will arrive in Macedonia on Sunday to do preliminary screenings
    on Monday.   Refugees will depart for US on Tuesday, arrriving on Tuesday
    afternoon/evening.

    TALKING POINTS

     -- Due to the large influx of refugees into Macedonia, we would like to
    move them into the United States as quickly as possibe.

    -- We anticipate that sometime early next week, Ft. Dix will receive the
    first arriving groups of refugees.  An exact date is unknown at this time.


-- We are pursuing two tracks for processing refugees.  We hope to operate
a full-blown processing center in Macedonia, and also a partial
Macedonia/Ft. Dix processing system.
