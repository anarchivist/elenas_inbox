DRAFT -- NOT FOR RELEASE

H.R. 3789 - Class Action Jurisdiction Act of 1998
(Hyde (R) Illinois and 10 cosponsors)

The Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 3789 which would
grant Federal district courts jurisdiction in almost all class action
cases where any class member is a citizen of a state different from any
defendant.  This would have the effect of transferring a significant
number of class actions into Federal court and O&federalizing08 class
action standards.  States should be permitted to manage their own courts
unless it can be demonstrated that there is a nationwide problem
interfering with the fair adjudication of cases.   Since this has not been
demonstrated the responsibility for handling class action litigation
should continue to be shared between the State and Federal systems.

Class action litigation provides an important mechanism for vindicating
the rights of plaintiffs whose individual claims would not warrant
separate litigation and to resolve large numbers of related claims in a
single action. H.R. 3789 also would require class action cases that are
not certified in Federal court to be remanded to State courts and stripped
of their class allegations, even if such a class could have been certified
under applicable State standards.    This provision would eliminate a viable
remedy for individuals suffering injuries who could not otherwise afford
to bring suit on their own and would significantly infringe on State
court sO , ability to offer redress to their citizens.

H.R. 3789 would move substantial numbers of State class actions to Federal
courts at a time when the Chief Justice, among others, has expressed
serious concerns about the workload of the Federal courts. A study by the
Federal Judicial Center demonstrated that class actions are much more
resource-intensive than other kinds of civil litigation.  Particularly at
a time when so many vacancies on the Federal bench exist, moving virtually
all class actions to Federal courts would be counterproductive.
