TEXT:
Just had another one of those great calls with NCLR on bilingual
ed--Charles said he hoped the administration wasn't thinking of corning up
with an alternative for Riggs because it would be corne the ceiling for any
subsequent negotiation which would probably occur next year during
reauthorization because they don't believe the senate will do anything on
it- I told him that we really believe that reform is needed and you can't
beat something with nothing--they are not listening.He also said some of
the folks in Calif believe that our set of principles allowed UNZ to say
see even the President agrees that reform is needed rather than focus on
our opposition to UNZ.  So Michael--when are you gthering us together?
