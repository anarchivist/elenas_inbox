TEXT:
I got word from the Education Department that they are waiting for White
House clearance of the Secretary Riley's policy statement on bilingual
education as part of his ESEA testimony next week.   I will get a copy
shortly and will send it to you, in case you don't already have it. And
I'd be happy to send it to Maria, Mickey, and others if you want me to do
so. Mike Cohen and I have been trading calls but have not yet spoken.

You may already know all of this, but I wanted to be sure you knew.
Apparently, the major issue is whether the Secretary should reaffirm the
Administration'S commitment to a 3-year goal for LEP children learning
English. When Education informed some of the Hispanic groups this week
that the Secretary might make this statement, most of the groups were
apparently extremely upset.
The groups are apparently objecting more to the use of language about the
3-year goal· than the policy proposal currently envisioned by Education.
Riley is getting briefed over the weekend and will meet with Hinajosa
Monday. I am happy to help out in any way needed in my DPC capacity, and I
also would be interested in participating in any discussions about this
over the next couple of days wearing my VP hat.

More generally, this also raises questions for me about 1) how Tanya and I
should be handling issues before Mike's replacement is hired, and 2) how I
can best participate in policy discussions representing the VP on
specific issues like bilingual or more general issues like the ESEA
reauthorization. It'd be great to discuss these issues with you at your
convenience.    Have a good weekend!    -- Jon
