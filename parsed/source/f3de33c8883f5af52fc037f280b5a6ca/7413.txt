TEXT:
Beverly Barnes in the press office called ~nd has asked for a very brief
(2-3 sentences) statement on the President's position on privately funded
school vouchers/scholarships to private schools.   The reporter (Tom Toch,
from US News) is apparently doing a story on the House voucher vote this
week, the Administration's threat to veto it, and attempt to contrast this
position with Erskine's supposed leadership/involvement in local DC
efforts to raise private funds for scholarships. Anyway, how's this.

"The President opposes the use of public funding for private school
vouchers because this would drain critical funds from the public school
system attended by 90% of our this nation's children with little or no
accountability for how those funds are used.    The President is not opposed
to privately funded scholarships for private school tuition.    (could
add ... As Secretary Riley made clear in a letter to Congress this week
pledging to recommend a veto of a DC voucher bill, public funds should be
used for public schools, and only private funds should be used for private
school tuition.)
