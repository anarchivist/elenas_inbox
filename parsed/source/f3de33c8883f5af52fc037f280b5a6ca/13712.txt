          TONGASS: JUDGE OKs DEAL TO FREE SOME HELD-UP TIMBER SALES
             US District Court Judge John Sedwick on 5/22 approved a deal.
        that will free up about one-third of the Tongass National Forest
        timber sales that were tied up by a lawsuit first filed two years
        ago. The Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism Association
        had sued in an effort to secure new environmental studies before
        the US Forest Service could resell timber that had been pledged
        to now-defunct pulp and saw mills in Sitka and Wrangell.
             Under the deal struck between the feds, enviros and tourism
        groups, two-thirds of those sales must go through enviro reviews
        before they can be resold.   The accord also ensures that further
        enviro reviews of some sales will not have to wait if the US
        Forest Service is slow in completing its Tongass management plan.
             The federal government says the deal means some of the
        timber will be sold and harvested this year.
             Tom Waldo of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, which
        represented enviros:   "We hope the formal decision approving the
        agreement will pave the way for a new way of managing the
        Tongass" (Dirk Miller, AP/ANCHORAGE DAILY NEWS, 5/24).
