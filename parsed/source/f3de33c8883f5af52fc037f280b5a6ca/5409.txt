TEXT:
Sandy Korenman of CEA uncovered some state reporting errors in the July
caseload numbers.
California reported too many families on TANF for July (the number of
recipients was right) -- although we didn't release state-by-state numbers
for families, this California error made the overall number of families
reported for July too high and thus understated the decline in number of
families on TANF.

Also due to reporting errors, the number of recipients in Colorado was
actually higher than we reported and NJ was lower (see below). We're
still getting the details.  I doubt these changes affect the overall
number -- i.e., down over 3.8 million since 1993, 1.9 million. since last
August -- since we were "over" 40,000-50,000 on each.  In fact, given that
NJ's caseload is four times that of Colorado's (253,700 vs. 60,056) and we
over-reported NJ and underreported CO, the corrections may result in a
slightly larger decline in caseloads than we reported.

Subject:         errors in latest caseload numbers


To follow up on my earlier message:
I spoke with Howard Rolston today about the strange difference in the
chages in the number of families vs. number of recipients in the latest
numbers. As expected, the source is reporting errors.     Howard doesn't
have the final analysis, but the story is something l~ke the following.
California's number.s for families are incorrect due to the reporting of


all families rather than those getting $10 or more in benefits. The
number of recipients is correct. There were also problems with NJ and CO.
NJ's problems relate to de-linking Medicaid and TANF.   I believe as a
result CO's recipiency decline is overstated and NJ's is understated.

Sandy's earlier message said:

There are couple of odd things you mayor may not be aware of in the July
welfare 'numbers on ACF's page. I spoke with Howard Rolston about them this
morning, who is looking into them .

The decline in the number of recipients from June to July is about
240,000, which is in line with recent months, and indicates no slowing in
the caseload reduction ... in fact, a constant monthly decline indicates
acceleration in the rate of decline since the base is falling.    But the
reduction in the number of families between June and July is too low to
support the recipient decline ... only about 40,000.   This would mean the
average family size of families leaving is 6, compared to the overall
average size of just under 3. While it is theoretically possible for this
to be "real" (for example, states may be motivated to move two-parent
families off TANF due to work requirements), it more likely reflects an
error of some sort.

 The other issue is that some of the column headings in tables on the ACF
 web page are incorrect ... for example, the same numbers appear under
 columns headed "April 97" and "July 9,7" in different tables. These
'mistakes are pretty easy to figure out, however.
