TEXT:
Marcia and I feel strongly that two Governors on the NGA 0-3 Task Force be
offered speaking roles and that the remaining four be invited to attend
and not speak. Governor Chiles has expressed serious interest in
attending and is on the Task Force, but would not be picked by NGA to
speak because he does not have a leadership role in NGA.

Can I call NGA and tell them that Governors will be able to participate
but we're not sure how many and what the roles will be? We'd like to be
able to do this today or tomorrow morning. Thanks.
