A:   No. To the contrary, we do not want to do anything in this area until we have held public
     hearings on this issue and until there are federal privacy protections in place.

     As directed by the Congress through the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
     Act of 1996 (Kassebaum-Kennedy), we are looking into adopting standards for providing
     for unique health identifiers to help improve electronic transfer of health and billing
     infonnation.

     In response to the law, HHS has already made regulatory proposals to create identifier
     numbers for employers and providers, and is developing proposals for insurers.
     However, providing a health identifier number for each individual is a far more complex
     issue and raises serious privacy concerns.

     For that reason, we have delayed any movement so that we can develop consensus as to
     how to proceed in this area. The only action we have taken to date is to establish a
     process so that we can fully consult with all parties, particularly consumers. We intend
     to hold hearings on this issue in short order even before we issue a proposed rule.

     We would advise against implementing individual identifiers before establishing
     comprehensive privacy protections. Last fall, the Secretary ofHHS made
     recommendations for Federal privacy protectipns, and we have continually called on
     Congress to pass legislation in this area. The HHS Advisory Commission has advised
     against implementing these protections before we have established privacy protections.
     However, we will consult with all interested parties as to how best to proceed.
