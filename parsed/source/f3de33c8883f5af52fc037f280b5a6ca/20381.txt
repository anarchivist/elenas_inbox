TEXT:
HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE IS SCHEDULED TO MEET TODAY AT 4PM ON THE ENERGY &
WATER APPROPRIATIONS FY99 BILL. ATTACHED IS A DRAFT SAP FOR YOUR REVIEW.
PLEASE PROVIDE COMMENTS BY 3:30PM.

    H.R. 4060 -- ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT
                                 APPROPRIATIONS BILL, FY
1999
(Sponsors:   Livingston (R), Louisiana; McDade (R), Pennsylvania)


        This Statement of Administration Policy provides the
AdministrationD,s views on the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Bill, FY 1999, as reported by the House Appropriations Committee.  Your
consideration of the AdministrationD,s views would be appreciated.

        The Administration appreciates the challenges faced by the
Committee in funding a wide array of needs within tight budgetary
constraints.  However, we are concerned that the $723 million increase
provided by the Committee for Army Corps of Engineers projects has come at
the expense of other priority programs.


Army Corps of Engineers

        We urge the House to redirect some of the unrequested funding
added by the Committee for Army Corps of Engineers construction activities
to fully fund priority Corps activities at their requested levels, such as
the Columbia and Snake River salmon recovery efforts and Everglades
restoration, and to ameliorate harsh cuts in other priority programs
funded by the bill.

Renewable Energy

        The Committee mark eliminates the Administration'S requested
increase for the solar and renewable energy program, effectively freezing
it at its current level and eliminating funding for many valuable
cost-shared projects with industry. The Committee has also cut requested
new funding for fundamental research into carbon sequestration and
climate-change dynamics in half, a reduction of $13.5 million from the
PresidentD,s request. These funding levels result in a reduction of about
one-third -- $107 million -- in the PresidentD,s total requested increase
for development of clean, non-greenhouse gas power sources. These changes
would seriously undercut the Department of EnergyD,s (DOED,s) ability to
move into the next phases of some of the most promising research now
underway, eliminate accelerated introduction of clean power sources, and
restrict our ability to lower greenhouse gas emissions levels. The
Administration strongly opposes these reductions.  These programs provide
numerous benefits including greenhouse gas reduction, increased industrial
competitiveness, increased job opportunities, reduced energy costs for
consumers, increased energy independence, and improved air quality.   We
will work with the Congress to restore funding in this critical area.

Department of Energy Defense Activities

         The Administration strongly objects to the CommitteeD,s $358
million reduction to the request for nuclear weapons activities. The
Committee states that $305 million of that reduction is to come from the
use of prior-year balances.  Such large balances are not available.   This
cut would force real reductions in critical programs needed to ensure the
safety, security, and reliability of AmericaD,s nuclear deterrent.

        The Committee has cut $15 million from the request for the Worker
and Community Transition Program and has added $16 million for the
unrequested acceleration of decommissioning activities at old facilities
used for Naval Reactors Development. The Naval facilities are in safe
shutdown conditions and are not a threat to the environment. The
Administration objects to the shifting of funds needed to assist displaced
workers to accelerate low-priority activities.

Science and Fusion

        The Administration appreciates the CommitteeD,s efforts to fund
fully the majority of the Science accounts.

        However, the Committee proposes to eliminate all funds for the
Next Generation Internet (NGI) program at the Department of Energy. The
NGI initiative, announced by the President last fall, provides the R&D
necessary to revolutionize high-speed networking capabilities in the
united States.  Some DOE laboratories will be among the facilities to
benefit from the 1,000-times faster network to be established by the NGI.
Further, the multi-agency NGI effort will suffer without the participation
of the Department's expert network and user communities.



        The Administration strongly·objects to the $57 million reduction
in the request (down to a level of $100 million) for construction of the
Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in FY 1999. The Administration is
committed to providing the resources required to complete the SNS at cost
and on schedule.

        Finally, the Administration objects to the elimination of funding
to participate in the extension of the international planning process
that led to the international design effort for the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). This action would have a
serious negative impact on U.S. participation in future international
fusion efforts.   Moreover, since the United States hosts the international
design center in San Diego, California, the Administration is concerned
that a U.S. withdrawal from the ITER-planning process would undermine the
credibility of the United States in future negotiations on international
science projects.

Environmental Management

        The Administration objects to the $230 million reduction in the
Defense Environmental Management Privatization.account. These funds are
needed to meet required milestones and complete nuclear waste cleanup of
DOE facilities.  The Administration also opposes the $47 million reduction
in the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund. This
reduction would significantly delay environmental restoration efforts at
the plants covered by the fund, thereby increasing the cost for these
activities.

Nuclear Waste Disposal

        The CommitteeD,s reduction of $30 million to the request for the
civilian radioactive waste program, and its directive to reduce support
services by ten percent, would significantly reduce the quality of data
and analysis for the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) at Yucca
Mountain.  A quality DEIS, which is an FY 1999 milestone, is a necessary
prerequisite to an FY 2001 Site Recommendation.

Bureau of Reclamation

        We urge the Committee to fund fully the request for the California
Bay-Delta program. Less than full funding could delay Federal and State
efforts to restore this important ecosystem. We also urge the Committee
to restore the reductions totaling over $60 million in other Bureau of
Reclamation programs, in particular $16 million for the environmentally
important, user-financed Central Valley Project Restoration Fund and $11
million for vital darn safety work.

Other Issues

 The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's providing only $5
million of $34 million ,requested for the Nuclear Energy Research
Initiative and the Nuclear Energy plant Optimization program and urges
that the full amount of the request be restored.

 As drafted, the CommitteeD,s transfer proposal could leave a gap in
safety and health oversight at the Lawrence Berkeley facility.  Specific
statutory authorization may be needed to provide either OSHA or the State
of California with appropriate jurisdiction for regulating occupational
safety and health. In consultation with congressional authorizing


  committees, the Administration is developing a plan for oversight of both
  occupational and nuclear safety within the DOE complex.

           The Administration is concerned about the billn,s reduction to
  the program direction accounts in Departmental Administration. The
  Administration would like to work with the Committee to ensure that the
  Department has the necessary work skills within its work force and that
  reductions in force are not needed.

   The Administration objects to the CommitteeO,s elimination of all
  appropriations for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). TVAD,s non-power
  programs should receive Federal appropriations just as similar programs in
  other regions of the Nation are financed by appropriations to other
  Federal agencies.

   Finally, the Administration objects to section 306 of the Committee bill
  which appears to impact adversely efforts at national laboratories to
  stimulate cross-cutting developments in the private sector.
