TEXT:
When does this need to be ready? We're on track to get a document drafted
and cleared by 4/25, but not ready to release it at an event earlier in
the week.   Good (long) meeting w/OMB staff today but still need to work
through some details on pieces we would highlight.    Is that o.k. given a
press conference next week is unlikely? Any chance we could do an event
in the following 1-2 weeks? Given the extensive public participation
in/anticipation of the report and the need to get moving on actions in it,
I don't think we'll be able to sit on it for long.
