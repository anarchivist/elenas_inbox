TEXT:
Attached is what we sent to HHS.  It finally dawned on OMB that the
penalties most strongly linked to child support (misuse of funds and the
one related to child support) are not that likely to be imposed and
therefore not that strong a disincentive for states.  So they.asked to
piggyback onto our chosen penalties for work for the most part. We told
them HHS may argue that there is no link between some of those penalties
and child support.

Here are the penalty links we made by area:

Work                                        Child Support
1. Participation Rates                      1. Participation Rates
                                            2. Failure to require individuals
to coop.
                                                w/child support rules
2.  Time Limits                         3. Time Limits
3.  Failure to maintain assistce to
       parents who can't get child care
       for child under 6
4.  Failure to sanction indivs          4.  Failure to sanction
indivs who refuse to work
       who refuse to work

would apply to and which they would not.

REG LANGUAGE:

271.51: Degree of Non-Compliance and 272.5 -- Reasonable Cause Exception

Here is the language HHS has already agreed to:

We will not forgive the state penalty under 272.1 (a)(4) [work participation rate penalty] based on
reasonable cause unless a state demonstrates as part of its reasonable cause application that it has
not diverted cases to a separate state program for the purpose of avoiding the TANF work
participation requirements.

Possible revision:

Work: We will not forgive the state penalty under 272. 1(a)(4), 272. 1(a)(9), 272.1(a)(11), or
272.1 (a)(14) based on reasonable cause if we detect a significant pattern of diversion of families
to a separate state program that achieves the effect of avoiding the work participation rates.

[Note: 4 penalties above are work participation, time limit, failure to maintain assistance to
parent who can't get child care for child under 6, and failure to sanction individuals who refuse
to work.]                        .

Child Support: We will not forgive the state penalty under 272. 1(a)(4), 272. 1(a)(6), 272.l (a)(9),
or 272.l(a)(14) based on reasonable cause if we detect a significant pattern of diversion of
families to a separate state program that achieves the effect of preventing the federal collection of
child support.

[Note: 4 penalties above are work participation, failure to require individuals to cooperate with
child support rules, time limit, and failure to sanction individuals who refuse to work.]

272.6(1) -- "Some or all" of penalty after corrective compliance plan fails:

Work: We will not reduce the penalty under 272.1 (a)( 4), 272. 1(a)(9), 272.1(a)(11), or
272.1(a)(14) if we detect a significant pattern of diversion of families to a separate state program
that achieves the effect of avoiding the work participation rates.

Child Support: We will not reduce the state penalty under 272. 1(a)(4), 272. 1(a)(6), 272.1 (a)(9),
or 272.1(a)(14) if we detect a significant pattern of diversion offamilies to a separate state
program that achieves the effect of preventing the federal collection of child support.
[Note: same penalties as under reasonable cause.]                         Hex-Dump Conversion
PREAMBLE LANGUAGE:

In several places where we discuss penalties, we note that we will not forgive certain penalties
due to reasonable cause, reduce certain penalties after a corrective compliance fails, or reduce the
work participation rate penalty based on the degree of non-compliance if we detect a significant
pattern of diversion of families to a separate state program that achieves the effect of avoiding the
work participation rates. The same is true for certain other penalties if we detect a significant
pattern of diversion of families to a separate state program that achieves the effect of preventing
the federal collection of child support.

We plan to monitor states' actions to determine if they constitute a significant pattern of
diversion. For example, if we came to the conclusion through an examination of statistical or
other evidence that a state was assigning people to a separate state program in order to prevent
federal collection of child support, or in order to evade the work requirements, we would
conclude that this is a significant pattern of diversion, and would deny that state certain types of
penalty relief.

A state would be permitted the opportunity to prove that this pattern was actually the result of
state policies and objectives that were entirely unrelated to the goal of diversion, but we would
make the final judgment as to what constitutes a significant pattern of diversion.
                                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
