The President opens discussion by introducing David Hamburg, who will facilitate
presentations of emerging knowledge on early childhood development. [David Hamburg,
President of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which produced the Seminal 1994 Study
"Starting Points." Last year, David Hamburg received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.]

David Hamburg makes very brief remarks and introduces the following three consecutive
speakers:

       Dr. Donald Cohen, Director of the Yale University Child Study Center
       Will discuss emerging knowledge in the field of behavioral development.

       Dr. Carla Shatz, Professor of Neurobiology at the University of California, Berkeley
       Will explain brain development and wiring.

       Dr. Patricia Kuhl, Chair, Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, Univ. of
       Washington
       Will explain emerging knowledge about how infants learn

POTUSIHRC SUGGESTED QUESTION: What kind of stimulation is most beneficial for
our youngest children and what kind could be harmful? (To Cohen)

POTUSIHRC SUGGESTED QUESTION: Tell us more about the patterns of interaction
between an infant and the adult caring for him that are crucial for language development.
(To Kuhl)

The President thanks the first three presenters and introduces the next segment.

POTUS: We have just heard compelling presentations of how infants develops -- indisputable
evidence of how just how critical important the earliest years of life are. Now we're going to
turn our attention to ways we can put this knowledge to good use for the well-being of all our
children. We're going to hear from three experts who represent fields that provide vital frontline
services for new parents and their children: obstetrics and prenatal care, pediatrics and child care.
 First 1'd like to turn to:

Ezra Davidson, Professor of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Charles R.
Drew University 'of Medicine and Science.
He will discuss the importance of prenatal and perinatal services to reach parents new parents.

POTUS SUGGESTED QUESTION: How can we encourage people who work with expecting
parents to better use that opportunity to talk about the importance of early learning?




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion

Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, Professor Emeritus at Harvard University Medical School
Dr. Brazelton will discuss the pediatrician's role in early childhood development.

NRC QUEST/ON: Today, the Organization Zero to Three National Center for Infants,
Toddlers, and Families is releasing the results of a nation-wide survey ofparents ofyoung
children, which was conducted to gauge what parents know about their children's
development and what more they want to know. It is clear from thefindings that parents are
hungry for information on how they can best enhance their children's development. Could
you please give our nation's parents some guidance?

POTUS turns to:

Dr. Deborah Phillips, who works at the Institute of Medicine as the Director of the Board
on Children, Youth and Families ofthe National Research Council's Commission on Social
and Behavioral Development.
Dr. Phillips will talk about the important implications of this research for child care.

POTUS SUGGESTED QUESTION: What the most important components to quality child
care?

NRC QUEST/ON: Some people suggest that what this research really tells us is that women
shouldn't work outside of the home. Can you comment on that?

The President thanks participants and closes session.
