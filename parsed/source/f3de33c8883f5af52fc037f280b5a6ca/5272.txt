TEXT:
It looks Doggett's amendment to prohibit the US government's promotion of
tobacco abroad will be in State/Commerce. The amendment actually
basically reflects current US policy, but it is a formalization of our
position. When the President signs it, i think we can say that it will
balance the Etheridge position that we won't discriminate against US
farmers with the comittment that we also won't promote tobacco overseas.
