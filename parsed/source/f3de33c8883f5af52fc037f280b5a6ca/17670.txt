Q:   What is your reaction to reports that the Senate Republican Leadership (Lott
     and Nickles) are encouraging insurers/businesses to actively lobby against
     consumer protection legislation? Do you believe their critique of reforms in this
     area, which suggests that this is just a veiled attempt for the Government to take
     over the health care system, will be effective in stopping any legislation in this
     area?

A:   No inflammatory and inaccurate rhetoric can hide the fact that there is broad,
     bipartisan support for national consumer protections. In fact, the legislation that has
     received the most attention and support in the Congress (and has almost 200
     cosponsors, including 85 Republicans) was introduced by a
     Republican --Congressman Norwood (R-GA). Moreover, the Quality and Consumer
     Protection Commission's preliminary recommendations for a "Consl:lmer Bill of
     Rights" comes from a broadly representative group of insurers, businesses, health care
     providers, and consumer advocates.

     There is certainly plenty of room to debate the specifics of how best to assure that the
     health care our citizens receive is of the highest quality nature possible. However,
     attempts to demonize efforts designed to protect consumers in a rapidly changing
     health care system fool no one and certainly do not represent a constructive and
     certainly are not constructive.

Q:   Do you support the Norwood bill or any Federal legislation designed to enforce
     consumer protections?

A:   Federal legislation certainly is one way to enforce these protections. I have not taken
     any final position on the Norwood bill, but my staff is currently conducting a detailed
     review of the legislation. I have not received the Quality Commission's report and
     have made no final determination about how consumer protections should be assured.
      As you know, the Quality Commission will be submitting their final
     recommendations on the "Consumer Bill of Rights" on November 19th. I look
     forward to reviewing it and do not plan to make any announcement on my position on
     this issue before that time.

Q:   Who are you considering for your appointments to the Medicare Commission?

     As you know, the Balanced Budget Act requires that these appointments be made by
     December 1. I am still in the process of considering a range of highly qualified
     candidates with a wide variety of backgrounds and expertise in health care and the
     Medicare program. I have yet to make any final decisions.
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
Q:   Will you be appointing any Members of Congress to the Commission? Also,
     what is your response to Senator Daschle appointments -- Senator Kerrey and
     Senator Rockefeller to the Commission?

A:   There are obviously lots of members who could add a tremendous amount to this
     Commission. However, I have not made any final decisions.

     With regard to Senator Daschle's appointments, both Senator Kerrey and Senator
     RockefelIer have a good deal of experience in this issue and are extremely
     knowledgeable and committed to the Medicare program. As Members of the
     Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare, they are logical and
     welcomed additions to the Commission.

Q:   What is your position on the AMA-backed Kyl Medicare amendment and
     Senator Kyl's hold on the vote for Nancy-Ann Min DeParle's to be the
     Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration?

A:   First, I am deeply concerned about the so called hold. Nancy-Ann Min DeParle is
     well qualified and the delay in her confirmation undermines the multi-billion dollar
     Medicare and Medicaid programs and the tens of millions of Americans they serve.

     With regard to Senator Kyl's proposal, I do have concerns. It is premature to open
     up the three month old Balanced Budget Act and all of its carefulIy constructed
     Medicare policies we agreed on to modernize the program and extend the life of the
     trust fund to 2010.

     Moreover, none of us can or should or ignore the opposition to this amendment by
     almost every credible aging advocacy organization in this nation. They have raised
     serious concerns about the Kyl amendment citing the potential for fraud as well as
     reduced access to much needed physicians in rural communities. These and other
     concerns about Kyl's proposal deserve careful consideration before any modification
     to current law is made.


Q:   HHS recently sent letters to all states reminding them that any recapture of
     Medicaid expenditures attributed to a tobacco settlement must be apportioned in
     the normal allocation of Federal/state Medicaid spending. Why should the
     Federal government have access to settlements that were negotiated by states
     with the Federal government.

A:   It is my understanding that the letter simply states current law which explicitly
     requires that the Federal share of any recapture of Medicaid expenditures, whether it
     be for fraud, provider overpayments, or any other recoupment, be returned to the
     Federal government.
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

While we must enforce the law, we also well recognize that a national legislative
agreement on tobacco will inevitably raise Federal/state allocation issues that must be
addressed through the legislative process. We look forward to working with the
states on this important issue.
