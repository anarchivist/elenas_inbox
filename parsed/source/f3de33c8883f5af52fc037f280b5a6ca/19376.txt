TEXT:
Elena,
I spoke with Peter reo next steps on INS reform.  He thinks that we should
be drafting legislation that would enact our proposal.  INS General
Counsel is taking a first stab at this, and we should have something to
look at in about a week. After we have draft legislation, Peter would
like to shop it to members.  Both Kennedy and Mel Watt (ranking member on
the House Judiciary subcommittee) have expressed interest in sponsoring
the legislation. Peter would like to get Kennedy and Abraham to
co-sponsor it. There will likely be at least one hearing on this after
the break. Watt has asked Lamar Smith for a subcommittee hearing in May.

Peter feels stongly that we need to continue to work on developing policy
to fill the holes in our proposal. This will indicate to Congress that we
are serious about this reform, not just about stopping Rogers.  Also,
according to INS, Booz-Allen is continuing their work for the next three
weeks. Julie Anbender (from INS) was unsure of what exactly they have
been tasked to do, but will find out and let us know.  Hopefully, they
have been"asked to provide more detail on the reform plan.

Peter also said that we need to be very prepared to respond to questions
about cost. I have flagged this for OMB and INS.

Finally, according to INS, there will be a story in USA Today reo INS
reform in the next couple of days.  The reporter (Walter Shapiro) has
spoken with INS communications and Doris.

Julie
