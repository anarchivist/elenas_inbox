FROM: OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE: MAY 6, 1997

SUBJECT:   LEGISLATIVE REPORT


The Senate continues to debate the Bosnia/Disaster Supplemental, though no
significant progress was made on the most contentious issues.  Meanwhile, the
House Rules Committee today postponed their consideration of the bill until
next week at a time to be determined.


Senator Lott asserted that the Democrats are delaying disaster assistance to
needy victims by filibustering the bill, pending resolution of the automatic
continuing resolution.  Senator Daschle denied that any such filibuster was
underway and that, in fact, it was DemocratsD, desire to expedite consideration
of the bill.  Senate Democrats are circulating a letter to the President saying
they would vote to sustain his veto if he vetoed the supplemental because of
the automatic continuing resolution.  The letter currently has 37 signatures.

CONGRESS TODAY (5/6):

SENATE
The Senate continued consideration of S. 672, the Bosnia/Disaster As sistance
Supplemental, and adopted the Grams amendment, regarding the deposi tory
disaster relief act, by a vote of 98 to o.  Senator Reid today offered his
amendment to strike the Endangered Species Act waiver.
 [SAP sent, 5/5: D&Based on the Senate Committee bill, which included the
automatic continuing resolution, the President had indicated that he would
veto it because it includes strongly obj ectionable    extraneous provisions. DB]
