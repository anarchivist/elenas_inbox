                               STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT

            The preliminary crime data released by the FBI today confirm that crime rates in
     America will continue to decline substantially for a seventh straight year. During the first
     six months of 1998, serious crime fell by another 5 percent -- with large reductions in
     murder and other violent crimes leading the way. If these trends hold for the remainder
     ofthe year, we will have cut the nation's murder rate by one third since I took office. This
     is remarkable progress, and it shows that our strategy of more police, tougher gun laws
     and better crime prevention is making a difference. But our work is far from down. In
     the coming, as we finish the job of putting 100,000 more police on the streets, we must
     continue to do everything we can to make all of our communities safer.
