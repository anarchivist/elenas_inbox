Subject:         Call from Distilled Spirits Council

FYI ... I may need your help with this situation if I don't get an answer in
a couple of days from Elena and Bruce.    I've been pushing them for over a
month now to give Distilled Spirits an answer to their letter to POTUS
from April and they haven't been able to focus on it yet. If you see them
could you please give them a little push for me? We could have a bad
press problem on our hands next week if I don't tell Distilled Spirits
something this week ... they haven't shared details on their public campaign
but I assume it will be an all out effort to get the WH to bring all sides
of the alcohol advertising issue to the table.

I'll keep you posted.

Heads up ... got my weekly call from Tim Dudgeon with Distilled Spirits
Council this morning and he really needed to hear from us this week
because he has held his folks off of a public campaign effort on this
issue about as long as he can ... as of next week he's not sure what will
happen. We REALLY need to focus on this and give them an answer to their
April letter to POTUS calling for him to convene a meeting of all sides.

HELP!
