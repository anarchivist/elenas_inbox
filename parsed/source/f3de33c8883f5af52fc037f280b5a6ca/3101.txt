TEXT:
I thought you did a great job of saving us from ourselves, and reminding
us what's at stake here.   I'm even less convinced now than I was going
into the meeting that the compromise will work (though we still won't know
for sure until we see it), though I am more convinced than previously that
we have to give it a shot.
