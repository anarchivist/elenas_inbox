TEXT:
I tried to reach Cynthia first, but everybody was out, so in my continuing
effort to commit process fouls, I asked Treasury to whip up some new
talking points on black market, based on our new McCain-friendly
approach. USA Today is doing a story for tomorrow, and Mike is bound to
start getting pounded soon.  I talked to Gruber (I couldn't reach Wolen);
he promised new paper this afternoon.
