TEXT:
I think a Team Leader meeting is a very good idea and I look forward to
making the meetings regularly.   However, I am unfortunately being ordered
up to the Hill for a Medicaid budget meeting.   I have to leave at 9:15 to
be there for a 9:30 meeting.   Hope you will excuse my absence.

Jeanne and I have been working on a fairly easy presentation of our
Medicaid policy.  I will leave you what I plan to work off of in the
morning.  Hope you find it to be useful.  Talk to you soon.
