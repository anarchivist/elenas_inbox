TEXT:
John Fraser is doing reV1S10ns to the demonstration program paper that you
have (as a possible back-up offering). Barbara Chow has asked that he do
two versions: one that lays out the areas where pilots are authorized
 (similar to the version you have) and one that just references pilots
generally. John is currently in a meeting, but he will fax the revised
versions to you as soon as he can.
