 TEXT:
 It appears that the last standing environmetnal issue in the new
 transportation bill (ISTEA reauthorization) is energy efficiency and
 climate change.  I have been working with WH and agencies with the goal of
 getting something done in time for Secretary Slater's testimony on
 Wednesday 2/26. Attached is the latest iteration of a proposal for your
 information and comment.

 I have advocated the position that the Administration's ISTEA proposal
 should be consistent with what the President will need to say on climate
 change within the next few months. Beyond that basic position, I have not
 taken a particular position up to now.  In contrast, this compromise
 proposal may be unacceptable to EPA's assistant secretary (David
 Gardiner), but I do not expect Administrator Browner to press the issue.

 Subject:         A draft memo on Energy Efficiency in NEXTEA

 Attached is a proposed memo making an R&D proposal to promote energy
 efficiency in transportation--it reflects staff input from OSTP and OMB.
 This R&D would substitute for both EPA's $500 million proposal and DOT's
 formula adjustment idea. The memo is an attempt to propose an idea that
 WH offices and agencies could agree to.

 Please let me know of your reaction by noon on Tuesday Feb. 25.

MEMORANDUM TO                 DRAFT DRAFT

FROM:                         DRAFT

SUBJECT:                      NEXTEA and Energy Efficiency

We have been working to resolve the question of whether additional provisions on energy
efficiency need to be included in the Administration's proposed reauthorization oflSTEA (called
NEXTEA). The reason for concern is the coincidence between the debate on ISTEA and the
development of the United States' position on targets and timetables to reduce the emission of
greenhouse gases. Our goal is to ensure that the two sets of policies are not inconsistent, and are
complementary to the extent possible.

To achieve this goal, EPA has suggested that we include in ISTEA a $500 million fund to reward
states that most reduce their per capita energy consumption in the transportation sector. The
Department of Transportation has responded that the key determinant of per capita energy
consumption is likely to be the states' economic health, not state policies designed to encourage
transportation energy efficiency. Thus, an incentive system will not generate significant
innovation because states do not have the information and tools'to choose policies that have a
reasonable likelihood of substantially affecting energy efficiency in the transportation sector.
Given this lack of information, NEXTEA should propose investments in developing the tools
states and localities need to increase energy efficiency in the transportation sector. These
investments would be in addition to investments already reflected in DOT's draft NEXTEA, and
would build a foundation for more expansive approaches in coming years.

In addition, the Administration's NEXTEA proposal should not include DOT's preliminary
concept of a formula adjustment factor designed to hold states harmless for any reductions in
their contributions to the Highway Trust Fund. While this is a constructive idea, it will be
subject to the same criticism as EPA's proposed incentive system--namely the adjustment factor
will be too indirect to affect state policies, and therefore will not help to achieve the goal of
improving energy efficiency.

We suggest the following additional Administration investments in improving energy efficiency
in transportation:

1. Research for Energy Efficiency: Dedicate an additional $ 20 million per year to support
research in improving energy efficiency in transportation, including projects from the following
                                                                     Management System (Email)



list:
a)      Research health and safety impacts of alternative fuel vehicles (including biomass and
renewables), new technology batteries (including lithium-ion batteries) including transport,
storage, disposal and issues related to the PNGV fuels program and alternate power sources.
($\0 million/yr.)
c)       Smart highways including smart cars to reduce the recurrence of accidents in all modes of
transportation through an enhanced understanding of human performance and behavior. ($5
million/yr.)
d)      Electric and hybrid electric vehicle research and development support. This will include
true technical research and development, implementation strategies, and studies pertaining to true
electric vehicle total efficiencies and emissions. ($5 million/yr.)

2. Fuel Efficient Fleets - In addition to the 90% match available for clean-fueled buses, invest
an additional $8 million per year in fuel efficient heavy-duty vehicles. As EPA proposed,
subsidize the difference in purchase price between fuel-efficient and other vehicles. The
authorization should be written broadly to give DOT flexibility to use loans and grants and to
vary the percentage and timing of the subsidy.

3. Demonstration of Energy Efficiency in Transportation: Set aside fund for energy efficiency
demonstration projects. State and local governments would be eligible to demonstrate policies
that can increase energy efficiency in transportation. Focus on implementation of on-the-ground
measures to increase energy efficiency of transportation including inter-modal planning, an
emphasis on minimized cost and environmental impact of the total transportation system. This'
investment would build a foundation for exploring broader incentives for energy efficient
transportation in the next reauthorization cycle. ($20 million per year.) (This is in addition to
the $10 authorization for intermodal strategic transportation research.)
