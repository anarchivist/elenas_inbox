FROM:      OMB LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

DATE:      SEPTEMBER 3, 1997

SUBJECT:           LEGISLATIVE REPORT


CONGRESS TODAY (9/3)

SENATE

Senators DO,Amato and Moynihan introduced a bill this afternoon to
disapprove the PresidentO,s item veto of the New York Medicaid
exemption.   In general, the Congress has 30 session days during which to
consider the disapproval bill under expedited procedures.   Introduction
of the disapproval bill does not, itself, impact the cancellation;    the
cancellation remains in effect during the 30 days.   Even if Congress
passes the disapproval, the President can veto the disapproval bill
effectively requiring a 2/3 vote to disapprove the cancellation.

H.R. 2160 - Agriculture FY 1998 Appropriations bill.
o       Passed (voice vote) Harkin amendment that funds the
FDA/anti-tobacco initiative at $34 million, the level requested by the
Administration, with an offset from USDA computer purchases.

The Senate continued consideration of S. 1061, the Labor/HHS
Appropriations Bill:
        [SAP sent, 9/2: senior advisors veto threat for controversial amendments
that    may be offered to 1) halt funding for the PresidentO,s
national testing initiative,    2) prohibit funds for supervising the
TeamsterO,s election, 3) provide that welfare recipients in workfare can
be paid at rates below minimum wage, and 4) direct approval of State plans
that privatize the administration of public assistance programs, in
addition to O&other concerns raised in the SAP.]

o       Passed (unanimous consent) Dorgan amendment that increases NIH
Cardiovascular research with an $8 million offset from NIH buildings and
facilities.

o       Passed (unanimous consent) Specter amendment on attendant care
that requires HHS to complete a study on the cost-effectiveness of
allowing the disabled to remain at home and receive Medicare coverage.

o       Rejected (25-74) Kyl amendment that would have cut LIHEAP by $528
million and transfer that money to Pell grants.

o        Adopted a Coats (R-IN) amendment (unanimous consent) to mandate a
National         Academy of Science study to determine how NIH should
prioritize resources.    The Senator expressed concern that the NIH
and Congress was allocating too          much finding to "hot" diseases or those
diseases.that have an active             lobby/advocacy community.

o       Adopted a Wellstone (D-MN)-McCain (R-AZ)-Boxer (D-CA) amendment
        (95-3) that     authorizes the creation of a new Parkinson's
Disease research        program.



o       Considered a Coats amendment that would ban the use of fetal
tissue in the   research of      Parkinson's disease. Sen. Coats
highlighted the uses of                  electively-aborted fetuses in
        research projects, claiming that permitting such         research
created a perverse incentive for         the medical community to perform
        abortions.

Late Wednesday evening, Senator Lott filed cloture motion to proceed to
the FDA bill. A vote on the motion will occur on Friday morning.


HOUSE
Took the following action on H.R. 2159 - Foreign Operations FY 1998
Appropriations bill (Vote on the Smith and Gilman/Pelosi amendments
related to population assistance are expected tomorrow) :
        [SAP sent 7/23: Pres .. veto threat over Mexico City amendment &
        State/Treasury/NSC veto threat over insufficient funding level for
        International   Affairs]

o       Approved (voice vote) Bereuter amendment to prohibit direct U.S.
economic assistance to the Government of Cambodia. U.S. humanitarian
assistance to Cambodia through non-governmental organizations and the
National Endowment for Democracy will be allowed to continue.

o       Approved (voice vote) Traficant amendment which prevents funding
for NATO expansion unless such funding has been authorized by law (by the
authorizing committee) .

The House named the following conferees for FY1998 Appropriations Bills:
o       Defense --Young (FL), McDade, Lewis (CA) , Skeen, Hobson, Bonilla,
                 Nethercutt,     Istook, Cunningham, Livingston,
Murtha, Dicks, Hefner, Sabo,     Dixon, Visclosky, Obey

Bonilla, Latham,         Livingston,     Kaptur, Fazio, Serrano,
DeLauro, Obey
o       Legislative Branch --

The House rejected (202-208) a Serrano (D-NY) motion to instruct Conferees
for H.R. 2209, Legislative Branch FY 1998 Appropriations, for a provision
in the Senate bill, which limits the increase in the Joint Committee on
Taxation to 4.64 percent.

Agreed (299-125) to a Kapter (D-OH) motion to instruct conferees on H.R.
2160, Agriculture Appropriations Bill, to agree to the Senate funding
levels for a FDA program to prevent the use of tobacco products by minors.

        [SAP sent, 9/2: senior advisors veto threat for controversial amendments
that    may be offered to 1) halt funding for the PresidentD,s
national testing initiative,    2) prohibit funds for supervising the
TeamsterD,s election, 3) provide that welfare recipients in workfare can
be paid at rates below minimum wage, and 4) direct approval of State plans
that privatize the administration of public assistance programs, in
addition to D&other concerns raised in the SAP.]

o       Senators Gregg (R-NH) and Coats (R-IN) plan to introduce an
amendment that would     require that any national testing
initiative be developed and administered         by an   independent
agency.   (A hearing will take place on national testing
                 tomorrow morning at     8:30 AM. Rep. Goodling is expected to
testify.)   Senator      Gregg claimed that this         amendment is in
line with the Administration     position.   Senator Coats offered a
second degree amendment that would also          require that any

HOUSE
Convene on Thursday at 10:00am for legislative business, and at 9:00am on
Friday.

On Thursday morning, the House will complete consideration of H.R. 2159 -
Foreign Operations FY 1998 Appropriations bill, with votes expected on the
following amendments:

o       Smith and Gilman/Pelosi amendments related to population
assistance

o       Stearns "sense of the House" amendment which encourages all NATO
members to pay their "fair share" of NATO expansion was introduced, and
passed by voice vote with a recorded vote postponed.  The amendment is in
large part a reaction to French leader Chirac's statement that he does not
want to pay for the most recent NATO expansion because of his disagreement
with refusing to admit some Eastern European countries in the latest round
of NATO expansion.

o       Burton amendment which would not allow more than $42 million in
"Development Assistance" to go to the government of India due to human
rights violations by the Indian government.

o       Fox amendment which would prohibit the use of Development
Assistance funds for directly supporting or promoting trophy hunting or
the international commercial trade in elephant ivory, elephant hides, or
rhinoceros horns.

o        Torres amendment to eliminate FO funding ($1.2 million in Foreign
Operations) for the U.S. Army's School of the Americas in Fort Benning,
Georgia ($3.1 million comes from the Defense appropriations bill). The
President, and many of his advisors, including General McCaffrey, support
funding for the school. For the first time, the FO bill contains
provisions which make funding for the School of the Americas conditional
upon certification by the Secretary of Defense that the school's
curriculum does not promote human rights violations (the bill also
requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of
State, to develop guidelines for human rights training) .

          Education, and Related Agencies FY 1998 Appropriations bill (final vote
          possible Friday)
