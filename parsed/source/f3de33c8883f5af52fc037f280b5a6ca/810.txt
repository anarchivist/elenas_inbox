TEXT:
I have the draft of the eo as it was sent to Todd Stern's office.
The room is changed to Room 472 for Friday's meeting. I have updated the
memo and its ready for signatures.
Nicole was confident Melanne would be fine with it however has forwarded
it to her

Last unresolved issue - (for me anyway!)
the memo is to "heads of departments" do you mean the list of 25 that I
left with you on Friday?
let me know and I can have the letter and draft eo out tonight. Thanks.
