TEXT:
Bill Hubbard called from FDA to say they were getting a good deal of
interest from Senator Collins in crafting a bipartisan bill on regulating
ago imports that might pass this year.    The problem is FDA would like to
shift the bill from sounding proactive -- we'll make sure foreign
countries have effective food safety systems -- to reactive. Although
they haven't drafted it yet, the new bill would say something like-- FDA
can halt imports if there are repeated incidents of violations or a
likelihood of reoccurrence.  FDA would then require assurances that the
violating company or nation to fix its problem before allowing further
imports.  FDA says they think the bill would still be effective, as a
practical matter they determine their enforcement priorities by studying
where there are existing problems.  Collins likes it because R's are
worried that farmers in the US will be faced with new farm regulations so
that we can hold foreign countries to an equivalent standard.   This
compromise bill lessens the need for new US rules.   I'll go ahead and
scope out where are consumer allies would be. My question is: do we want
to get a bill passed? Our current position is pretty strong, the
rhetoric of this compromise bill sounds worse.,
