House Veterans' Affairs Committee wants Funds From Potential Tobacco
Lawsuit to Benefit Veterans' Health Care --


WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- The VA health care system should be
among the recipients of any financial recovery from government litigation
against tobacco companies, two senior lawmakers urged in a letter today to
President Clinton.

In his State of the Union message, President Clinton announced plans to
sue tobacco companies for costs incurred by federal health programs.
Congressmen Bob Stump of Arizona and Lane Evans of Illinois, Chairman and
Ranking Democratic member respectively, of the House Committee on
Veterans' Affairs, noted the President's speech did not address the unmet
health care needs of veterans. They urged use of funds recovered in
litigation for expanding VA health care programs.

The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest federal health
care system in the country. Stump and Evans pointed out that the VA
currently spends $3 billion of its approximately $17 billion annual health
care budget treating tobacco-related illnesses.

"Mr. president,"   they wrote, "ther.e is a very high level of concern
among veterans and veterans' advocates regarding the adequacy of VA health
care funding for the future. Funding constraints are forcing VA to shrink
health care staffs, close clinical programs, and abandon plans both for
renovating old, substandard facilities and for meeting long-term care
needs of our aging veteran population. ' ,

"With growing health care needs associated with aging, " Stump and Evans
wrote, "veterans are increasingly turning to VA for care of chronic
health problems, many involving pulmonary illnesses."

In 1996, according to Stump and Evans, 24,588 veterans were diagnosed and
hospitalized with lung cancer. Their average age was 66.8 years. That same
year, 26,000 veterans averaging 68 years of age received VA hospital care
for chronic bronchitis. Another 9,278 veterans averaging 66 years of age
were treated for emphysema. VA patients with any of these three diseases
consumed more than 315,000 days of hospital care during fiscal year 1996.
