TEXT:
One of the possible amendments to the ed-flex bill is an amendment from
Lieberman adding a Mccain-Lieberman Troops to Teachers bill.  I am
reviewing the bill tonight, but I think it differs from our troops to
teachers plan -- most important in that it limits participation in the
program to retiring military.  We have said our proposal would support
other mid-career professionals as well.  I'll read the bill and have more
information on this tomorrow morning, but I wanted to give you a heads-up
on this.
