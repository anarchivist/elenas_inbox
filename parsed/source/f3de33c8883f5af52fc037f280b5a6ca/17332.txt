TEXT:
This seems like a possibly promising area for something in the area of the
race intitiative, especially if we don't already have any measures aimed
at helping Native Americans in our package of initiatives. The problems
correlate to some steps the Administration has taken generally in
education -- indian drop out rates are above 50%, and there are problems
in testing and school construction. However, when Mike and I had
representatives of BIA , the Department of Education, and OMB come in and
tell us what they would like today, we didn't get much.  If we came up
with something, what do you of trying to fit it in the race initiatives
for funding?
