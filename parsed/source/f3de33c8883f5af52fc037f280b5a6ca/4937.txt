TEXT:
Janna Sidley at the VAWA office discreetly tried to feel out the position
of the women's groups on the hate crimes legislation.  Janna talked to
NOW.   It seems that NOW would prefer the most wide-reaching option
including gender (Option 1 in the DOJ memo), but they could probably live
with legislation that had an animus requirement (Option 4B).  It seems,
however, they don't want to start out with the animus option, but would
live with it if that's where a compromise ended up.

It does seem that they have 2 non-negotiable points:

1.      Gender has to be included.
2.      Gender has to be treated the same as sexual orientation and
disability.

Regards, Mary
