Q.   What does HHS' recent report on teen birth rates say and what does it tell us?

A.   The new study, titled Declines in Teenage Birth Rates: National and State Patterns
     1991-97, demonstrates that the country is making real progress against this
     important problem. It reports that teenage birth rates have declined substantially
     during the 1990s, with particularly dramatic declines in the birth rate for young
     women who have already had one child. While there was a 6 percent decline in first
     births to teenagers, the rate of second births for teens was down by 21 percent between
     1991 and 1996; the overall teen birth rate dropped 15 percent from 1991 through 1997.
     The report also indicated that rates are down more for younger teens (15 to 17) than older
     teens (18 and 19). In addition, teenage childbearing is down in all race and ethnic
     groups, but the largest declines documented are for black teenagers, especially younger
     black teens. The report, which tracks teenage childbearing in the United States, was
     issued by the National Center for Health Statistics on Thursday, December 17.

     This report confirms that the President's strategy to prevent teen pregnancy is working.
     Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has supported innovative and promising
     teen pregnancy prevention strategies, including working with boys and young men
     on pregnancy prevention strategies. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen
     Pregnancy, a private nonprofit organization, was formed in response to the
     President's 1995 State of the Union. In 1997, the President announced the
     National Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, mandated in the welfare reform law.
     The first annual report on this Strategy reported that HHS-supported programs
     already reach at least 31 percent or 1,470 communities in the United States. In
     addition, significant components of the President's comprehensive effort to reduce
     teen pregnancy became law when the President signed the 1996 Personal
     Responsibility Act. The law requires unmarried minor parents to stay in school
     and live at home or in a supervised setting; encourages "second chance homes" to
     provide teen parents with the skills and support they need; and provides $50 million
     a year in new funding for state abstinence education activities.
