        A cornerstone of President Clinton's economic strategy to strengthen the economy and
ensure that every American can reap its rewards is investing in education and training. For more
than five years, President Clinton has worked to widen the circle of opportunity and create a
high-skilled workforce through HOPE Scholarship Tax Credits, the Lifetime Learning Tax
Credit, the expansion of Pell Grants, a more than doubling of dislocated worker training funds, a
new student-loan program that allows people to pay back their loans as a share of their income,
and providing additional incentives to businesses to provide training for their workers. And to
train American workers for the 21 st century, President Clinton believes we need a job-training
system for the 21st century. That is why he is working with Congress to pass the G.!. Bill for
America's Workers this spring.

         An issue that has received a lot of attention recently involves the shortage of trained
workers in the information technology (IT) industry. The Clinton Administration believes that
the first response to increasing the availability ofIT workers must be increasing the skills of
American workers and helping the labor market work better so there is a supply of skilled
workers where there is a demand for skilled employees. While it may be necessary -- at least in
the short-term -- to increase the number of visas for temporary foreign workers (under the HI-B
program), this must only be done in conjunction with doing more to raise the skill level of
American workers.

       In addition, the Administration believes that any temporary increase in the program
should be limited to the minimum amount necessary, as demonstrated by empirical evidence.
And expanding the number of visas, even temporarily, must be accompanied by needed
improvements in the HI-B program. Since 1993, this Administration has sought reforms of the
HI-B program, including requiring employers to "recruit and retain" U.S. workers before hiring
temporary foreign workers, prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them with foreign
temporary workers, and reducing the maximum stay forHI-B workers from 6 to 3 years. These
reforms, if enacted, would help target HI-B usage to industries and employers that are exhibiting
genuine labor shortages.

         Senator Kennedy's [bill/approach to this issue] addresses both the short-term and
long-term implications of the apparent skills shortage we are now experiencing. And we believe
that his bill is the appropriate vehicle to put American workers first and address the labor market
needs of our rapidly changing economy.
