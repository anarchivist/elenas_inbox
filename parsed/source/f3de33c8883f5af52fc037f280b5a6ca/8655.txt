Subject:         Stokes Amendment to VA/HUD for More Housing Vouchers

        HUD believes that Rep. Stokes will offer an amendment tomorrow on
the floor to increase HUD's housing vouchers (presumably wefare to work
vouchers) by $98 million (another 17,000 families).

        This amendment will be in order because it is fully offs.et: by
$98 million rescission of unneeded BA for Section 8 amendments (HUD is
providing assurance that this money is unneeded in 1999) and $8 million
reduction in salaries & expenses (which provides the necessary first year
outlay savings).   It may stand a decent chance of passage for the
following reasons:   it is Stokes' last amendment from the floor, it is
modest, and it is fully offset within HUD.
