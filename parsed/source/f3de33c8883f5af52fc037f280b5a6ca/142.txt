TEXT:
Please attend a brain storming/strategy session on possible
Administration responses to the new Congressional Review Act
requirements to comply with Reagan era executive orders on topics
such as takings, families and federalism.   This is a followup to a
meeting I had with Jack Quinn in which he asked that we pull
together representatives from various WH offices to coordinate our
strategy.
The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, June 11 at 1:00pm in room
350.   Please call my assistant Phyllis Kaiser-Dark (x54852) to let
her know if you plan to attend.
