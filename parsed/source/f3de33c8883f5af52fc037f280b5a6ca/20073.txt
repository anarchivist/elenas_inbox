                                     STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT


        Today, my Administration infonned the President of Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago, Illinois
        that the hospital will lose its Medicare funding on June 19, 1998, unless the facility takes steps to
        ensure that the events that led to the tragic death of Christopher Sercye will not be repeated.

        xx days ago, 15 year old Christopher died of gunshot wounds just 35 feet from Ravenswood,
        where friends had brought the young man for help. There is simply no excuse for this
        unthinkable death. No one should be left untreated just footsteps from a hospital entrance. No
        health care professional should turn the other way,and no supervisor should direct an employee
        not to intervene in a medical emergency.

        That is why the Health Care Financing Administration delivered a letter today advising
        Ravenswood hospital that unless they provide credible evidence that its policies have been
        restructured, it will lose all Medicare funding next month. This Administration stands ready to
        take the same strong action against any facility that does not assist in a medical emergency.

        I am also extremely pleased that the American Hospital Association has released new guidelines
        that advise hospitals to change any policies that prevent taking appropriate actions in a medical
        emergency. We cannot reverse last week's inexplicable tragedy, but we can and must take
        action so that it does not happen again.
