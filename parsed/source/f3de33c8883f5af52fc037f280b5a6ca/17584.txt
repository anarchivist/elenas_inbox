TEXT:
Bruce, EK, et.al.:

I forwarded the final Assaults directive memo to staff secretary and am
now circulating copies for all of you. Also, I have three different
versions of the d~rective for anyone who wants to take a final look.
Finally, and most importantly, Rahm just told me that the Radio address
was changed to Fast Track -- but that he was still going to try and get
the directive signed Sunday (?).

Jose'
