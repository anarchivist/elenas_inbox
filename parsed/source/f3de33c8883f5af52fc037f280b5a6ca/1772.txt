TEXT:
Kitty told USDA's COS that POTUS may want to announce food safety report
on the 24th. Where are we on that? I'm briefing Kitty Monday on the
issue at her request -- she's keenly interested because of the strawberry
outbreak.  It's not helpful, however, if she -- not DPC -- is taking
direction on this event from above.
