TEXT:
EK/BR:

With respect to the Household Survey findings, I don't think we should
include them in the weekly if you think they will leak -- what do you
think? I don't want to screw the one person at ONDCP who's willing to be
helpful to DPC.

I'll forward to both of you the copy of the memo to McCaffrey on this that
I got my hands on -- so you have some more info.
