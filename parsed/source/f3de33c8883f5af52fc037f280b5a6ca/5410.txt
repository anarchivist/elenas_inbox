Welfare Strategy Meeting
December 2, 1997
Draft Agenda


I.      Regulations -- Feedback from groups, Hill, etc.
                What was that WH Bulletin item re: "recent Administration
decision to excuse
                        penalties for several states that fell short on
some of the first
                        welfare-to-work participation requirements"?

II.     State TANF Reports --
                How many states have submitted them? What do they show?
                Given that reg is NPRM, how will we credit case load
reduction?

III.       Welfare to Work Competitive Grant Application:
                   When will we see a revised version?
                   When do you want to release?

IV.        Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers
                   We've been working with HUD and OMB on a possible proposal;
                   Who at HHS to involve?
