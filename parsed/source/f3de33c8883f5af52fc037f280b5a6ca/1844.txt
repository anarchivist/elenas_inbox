TEXT:
Elean: As you know, the difference is that the EO actually establishes an
IWG and the NSTC just supports this by recommending that one be created.
Not ideal, but not all that confusing. After looking at the NSTC report
language, there is no easy way to modify it without triggering a new round
of agency clearance. As an alternative, we could make sure the EO
announcement included something about the need for the task force to
address a broader set of issues and then release the NSTC report with
minimum fanfare later in the week to help shape the task force's agenda.
