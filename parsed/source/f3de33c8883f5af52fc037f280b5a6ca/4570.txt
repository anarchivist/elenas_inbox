Elena:

I bumped into Karen from Erskine's staff last night and asked her about
the status of our favorite labor issue.  She mention that she and Erskine
had just received a memo from Treasury on the topic and would be reviewing
it. It may be time to check-in withe COS's office and see what there next
move is.
