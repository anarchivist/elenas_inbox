TEXT:
Many of the verbal attacks have been aimed at McCain. But
                            he had a moment of triumph late last week when
his bill was
                            cleared for floor debate.

                            McCain was ecstatic, and when he encountered
reporters he
                             could not resist parodying some of the claims
against his bill.

                             " We're at $8 trillion for the whole package
-- 8 trillion! I t ' s
                            altering the national debt. This is the
biggest money-grab ever!
                             I t ' s the most liberal big-spending proposal
in the history of the
                             Congress of the United States,   " said McCain,
grinning widely.

                            He finished with a jab at critics who
whispered that his
                             concessions to the White House proved that he
possesses a
                            liberal streak.

                             " That McCain,   " the possible GOP presidential
candidate said
                            with a twinkle.    " We knew he was a Commie
pinko."
