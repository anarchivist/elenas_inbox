new on food safety given recent VP announcement June 12 FLOTUS speech on
education campaign.   Thoughts?

I know the airbag idea has basically been shot down.  But is there
anything else we could do on auto safety or seatbelts, perhaps tied to the
NEXTEA provisions? Or is there anything new we could do on food safety?

Both Rahm and Ann are eager to see what can be done on
family/consumer/safety themes, following up on last year's successful July
4th food safety hit ...

Thanks --
