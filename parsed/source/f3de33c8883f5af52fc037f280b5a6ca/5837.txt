  Thanks.    It will come from the President.   Is this draft OK?

  "Dear Bob:
  Thank you for your letter outlining my Administration's progress in
  addressing the AIDS epidemic.  I am sorry that I was unable to respond
  sooner.

  I am taking the concerns you have raised very seriously. The rising
  incidence of HIV infection among those who use injected drugs, and
  among their partners and children, is a major factor in the
  continued growth of this epidemic. Therefore, I will continue to
  support retention of the HHS Secretary's authority to decide whether
  to allow local communities to use federal funds for needle exchange
  programs.

  I appreciate the passion which you and other members of the
  Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS bring to the debate.  Be
  assured that my commitment to ending this epidemic -- and to
  responding to the needs of those already living with HIV and AIDS --
  remains firm.  We must all work together to stop this deadly disease,
  and I will take all measures within my authority to achieve that end.

  Thank you for sharing your concerns, and for your commitment to


 bringing an end to this terrible epidemic.   You have my best wishes."
