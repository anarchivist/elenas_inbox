  TEXT:
. I just received a call from a lawyer at DOl about a letter that
  Secretary Babbitt sent the President recently regarding
  enforcement of certain provisions of the Endangered Species Act.
  Are you familiar with/working on this? Please let me know ASAP.
  This is a question about whether the letter can be released.
  Thanks.
