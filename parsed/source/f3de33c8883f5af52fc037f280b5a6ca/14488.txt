 TEXT:
 The usual interagency/EOP Tuesday timber will be replaced by a
 meeting of the Interagency Steering committee this Tuesday, Januar
 28, 1997, from 3 ~ 5 pm in the CEQ Conference Room at 722 Jackson
 Place, N.W. Katie McGinty will chair the meeting, and we will be
 joined by members of the Regional Interagency Executive Committee
 and representatives from the Regional Ecosystem Office. The usual
 attendees at the Tuesday meetings should also attend, although in
 recognition of space limitation, please recognize that this is not
 a good week to invite additional people.
 The agenda will include:
 1.      The Pacific Northwest Forest Plan:   where are we and where
 do we go from here.
         a.       Evaluation of new information's effect on the Plan.
         b.       Report to the President and Congress on the Plan
                  and opportunities for progress.
 2.      Briefing from regional representatives on implementation
 and effectiveness monitoring progress under the Plan.
 3.      Litigation report, including last week's hearing before
 Judge Hogan on settlement agreement for alternative timber under
 the Rescissions Act.
 4.      Other business.

         AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THE MEETING WILL START AT 3:00 PM, not
 the usual 2 p.m.************************************************
