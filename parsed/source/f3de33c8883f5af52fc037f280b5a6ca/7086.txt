           SAN FRANCISCO (BCN)
           San Francisco's Chief Assistant City Attorney today called a
federal district judge's ruling to uphold the city's controversial
domestic partners ordinance, "a giant leap for human rights."
           Chief Assistant City Attorney Dennis Aftergut said, "We are
very,
very pleased," with united States District Judge Claudia Wilken's
decision allowing the city to require contractors doing business with
the city to provide the same benefits to domestic partners that are
provided to spouses of employees.
           Wilken's ruling allows the city to demand benefits for domestic
partners in cases where the city is a consumer, but not in cases where
the city acts as regulator, like at the airport.
           Under the ruling, contractors who enter into contracts to provide
goods and services to the city or lease city land must provide the
same health, pension, bereavement leave and other benefits to
employees with domestic partners that are provided to employees with
spouses.
           City Attorney Louise Renne said, " I t ' s like shopping at a
grocery
store. If you don't like the store's policies, you don't have to shop
there. ' ,
           Wilken's ruling does prevent the city from forcing contractors to
provide health and pension benefits in situations where the city


operates in a regulatory role, as at the airport. In these cases the
ordinarice is pre-empted by the Employment Retirement and Income
Security Act of 1974, a federal law.
         The ruling also prevents the city from forcing contractors with
employees who do not work in San Francisco and whose work does not
affect a contract with the city to provide domestic partner benefits.
         The ruling allows the city to force a company to provide domestic
partner benefits to workers who work outside the city, but whose work
affects a city contract.
         Aftergut said, "For example, if the city buys pencils from a
factory in Illinois, they must provide domestic partner benefits to the
employees who make the pencils."
         He also speculated tha~ the law would force some companies with
San
Francisco contracts to give domestic benefits to all employees,
instead of just the employees working on city contracts.
         Cynthia Goldstein of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission
estimates that the ruling will affect almost 800,000 people across the
United States.
         San Francisco Supervisor Tom Ammiano, co-author of the ordinance,
said, " I am as pleased as a pig in a poke with the judge's ruling."
         According to the City Attorney's office some companies already in
compliance with the ordinance include Pacific Gas and Electric,
Pacific Bell, Bank of America and Xerox.
