Q:   What is your reaction to the fact that Dr. Satcher criticized the Administration's
     position on needle exchange?

A:   The Administration is committed to reducing the transmission of HIV and reducing drug
     use. We believe that the decision that was made last week was the best way to advance
     these two goals. The Secretary of Health and Human Services made clear that the
     scientists, including all the respected leadership within the National Institutes of Health,
     have concluded that these programs do not increase drug use. We believe that it is
     extremely important or communities around the country, who are making their own
     decisions on this issue to know that appropriately designed needle exchange programs
     reduce HIV transmission and do not encourage illegal drug use. Dr. Satcher said on
     Friday, "I would not discount the significance of the decision that was made."


Q:   But his remarks seem to imply that he opposes the Administration's position on
     Federal funding on needle exchange. Is this accurate?

A:   We do not want to speak for Dr. Satcher who is one ofthe nation's most eloquent
     spokesman for public health. However, he did emphasize the significance of the
     determination that the Secretary made.

     We believe that the Administration's decision not to release Federal funding for needle
     exchange programs was the best approach to ensure that the public was informed about
     where the science is on this issue in a way that reduced the likelihood of it being
     politicized. Releasing federal funding for needle exchange would have inappropriately
     shifted the focus away from communities .. where these decisions should be made -- to
     the national level. That could have severely undermined or threatened local programs that
     are currently in place, and hindered additional communities from deciding to put these
     programs into place. We do believe, however, that having the science available will be
     extremely helpful for local communities to make decisions in this area.


Q:   What is your position on the Solomon Amendment to prohibit any Federal funding
     for needle exchange programs?

A:   We believe that the only purpose ofthis legislation is to politicize a decision that should
     be made at the local level. To us that is counter productive and an example of
     unnecessary and unwarranted micromanagement that many in Congress suggest they
     deplore. For this reason, we strongly oppose this language.

     While we are still reviewing this legislation, we are also concerned that the language is
     too broadly drafted so that it could conceivably have the potential effect of undermining
     the ability of local communities to make their own decisions to fund needle exchange
     programs.
