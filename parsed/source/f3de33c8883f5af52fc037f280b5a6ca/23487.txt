TEXT:
If we DO NOT want the TANF rule on display on Friday and published on
Monday, we MUST tell the Federal Register NO LATER THAN NOON THURSDAY.
This is a hard deadline.

If we want to postpone publication, the head of the Federal Register has
personally committed that we can postpone it to whatever date we prefer.
