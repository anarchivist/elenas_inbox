                                                                JOHN HILLEY



    I.      PURPOSE

          The purpose of this meeting is to (1) set a bipartisan tone with Congress and (2)
    emphasize that tobacco legislation should be a top priority for the coming year.


    II. .   BACKGROUND

            The Administration is in a strong position to push tobacco legislation through Congress
    over the next year. Your announcement earlier this month united the public health community
    for the first time and attracted bipartisan support from the nation's attorneys general and many
    members of Congress.

            Nevertheless, any tobacco bill will have to make its way through a tangle of overlapping
    committee jurisdictions and agendas. At least six committees in the Senate and four in the
    House can lay claim to some piece of this legislation, and dozens of members in both parties
    have a longstanding interest in tobacco from the standpoint of reducing teen smoking or
    protecting tobacco farmers. Republicans in particular recognize the political potency of the
    President's plan, and are very nervous about being trapped into the appearance of defending the
    industry.

           The first step must therefore be to reassure the leadership and key committee chairs like
    Rep. Bliley that the Administration is indeed serious about passing a bipartisan bill, and not just
    looking to sandbag them in an election year. The meeting with Congressional leaders,
    committee chairs, and ranking members is therefore an important opportunity to set the right tone
    from the outset: you are eager to work together to pass bipartisan legislation as early as possible
    next year, and we are ready to work in a collaborative fashion to get it done.
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

        Our next step should be for representatives of the Administration (including the
Vice-President, Erskine Bowles, Secretary Shalala, Secretary Glickman, John Hilley, and Bruce
Reed), to meet with the key players in both parties over the remaining weeks of this session, to
offer the Administration's expertise and to try to marshal bipartisan coalitions in both houses to
prepare bills for introduction in January. It is too early to tell which members are in the best
position to lead that effort. (Bliley is the key House Republican, Waxman and Fazio are
important House Democrats; Hatch, Lugar, McCain, Jeffords, Mack, Campbell and several
Republican moderates may be helpful in the Senate; Conrad, Lautenberg, Kennedy, and others
are strong Senate Democrats). Ideally, we can lay the groundwork for a center-out coalition in
the Senate, along the lines of Hatch-Kennedy or the Breaux-Chafee group, and work closely with
Bliley, Waxman, and others in the House.

       Senate committees have already held several hearings on tobacco over the past three
months. Secretary Shalala testified before Jeffords' committee last week. The House may hold
hearings in November-December after adjournment.

        The goal should be to forge a bipartisan vehicle you can endorse in January, and to make
that the central focus of next year's State of the Union.

        Opponents of the legislation will make three types of arguments to slow it down. First,
Nickles and others have criticized the Administration for failing to submit full legislative
language to Congress and blamed the Administration for any delay in passage of a bill. Second,
some will use the complexity of the issue as an excuse to go slow, eventually permitting perhaps
only restricted portions of a bill to advance following lengthy hearings. Finally, opponents of
legislation may focus on flashpoints such as farmers, restrictions on class action suits, or legal
fees.

        The Administration has a number of arguments to deploy in response to these expected
attacks. The strongest argument is to rise above partisan bickering, and stress the urgency of
solutions that will protect America's children. In addition, you have a strong history of
leadership on smoking issues and can draw upon public support in future disagreements with
Congress.

IV.    PRESS PLAN

to meet the press outside the White House following the event.

VI.    REMARKS


*        Thank you for coming to talk about this vital issue for America's future. (Acknowledge
Gingrich, Gephardt, Nickles, Daschle, Bliley) This is an issue that touches on many aspects of
American life -- our health, our economy, our laws, and our children -- and I want to
acknowledge the hard work of so many of you in this room on this issue. In particular, I want to
thank the Vice-President for his very important contribution. You are all here because of the
critical role you will playas we work to pass legislation together. It is complicated, but I'm
confident we can put politics aside and get this done.


*        You and I are here because this is a crucial issue for America's future. Three thousand
kids start smoking everyday, it shortens the lives of one thousand of them. As I've said before,
this is not about money, and it shouldn't be about politics. It should be about trying to reduce
this problem of teen smoking.

*       Two weeks ago, I outlined the most significant elements I thought should be contained in
a bill. First, that we should reduce teen smoking with tougher penalties, that we shouldn't
hamstring FDA authority to regulate tobacco, that there should be some changes in the way
tobacco is marketed, that we need to make more progress on other health goals like cancer
research and second hand smoke. Finally, and this is very important to me, we need to protect
farmers and their communities. This bill can't devastate those communities. They must be
protected.

*       This should not be a partisan issue, I'm going to put it at the top of my agenda for the
next year, and I hope you will join me in making bipartisan legislation to reduce teen smoking a
top priority for all of us in 1998

*        This bill will go through many committees and it affects many people and many states.
It is not going to happen by fiat, but after you hold hearings, and work through the difficulties of
legislation. And I'm sure we will have our differences. But this is too important for us not to
get done. And it can't wait until we all agree on every word. We should work together and try
to move ahead.

*      I've said in some detail what I believe is the most important here. I've asked several
members of my administration -- the Vice-President my Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, Secretary
Shalala, Secretary Glickman, Bruce Reed-- to work side by side with you to get this done.

*       But I asked you here not just to tell you what I think about the issue but to hear what you
think-- how we can work together, how we can get this done. So I'll ask Vice-President Gore to
give some of his thoughts, and I'd like to hear what directions you are going to take on tobacco
legislation, where the problems might be and how we can work together.

                                    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

     Q.   Why don't you submit legislation on tobacco?

     A. We're happy to offer Congress our expertise and any other help in translating our principles
     into bipartisan legislation. I don't think there is any doubt where I stand. The five principles I
     set out in my plan are very clear. This is the first time I can remember Congress asking us to
     write the bill -- I recall a somewhat different reaction when we sent up legislation on health care.
     Members should introduce legislation, hold hearings and move for votes and I will playas
     constructive a role as possible.


     Q.   When should a bill pass?

     A. It is at the top of my agenda for the coming year. There is nothing more important than
     saving thousands of children from taking up smoking. Three thousand are starting everyday.



     Q.   Will negotiations include industry?

     A.   The industry is a piece of this, but there isn't a need to negotiate with them.



     Q. What is the role of the Vice-President?

     A. The Vice-President will take a leadership role in the legislation and in building support for
     our plan.


     Q. Will you support limits ott liability?

     A. I've said repeatedly that a cap on liability wouldn't be a deal breaker for us. But if we're
     going to do that, we should make sure we're passing a strong comprehensive plan to cut teen
     smoking.
