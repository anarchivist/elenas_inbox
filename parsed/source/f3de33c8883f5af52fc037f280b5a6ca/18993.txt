Tobacco Farmers and Tobacco State Legislators
The DPC, OPL, and USDA have been working with tobacco state legislators and farmers to
assure them that the Administration will support tobacco legislation only if it protects tobacco
farmers and their communities. Bruce Reed and Erskine Bowles met Tuesday with House
Democrats from tobacco states -- Representatives Baesler (KY), Clayton (SC), Etheridge (NC),
Goode (VA), Price (NC), Spratt (SC) and McIntyre (NC), along with Congressmen Gephardt
and Fazio -- to discuss strategies for passing comprehensive tobacco legislation that could protect
the interests of tobacco farmers. The House members expect that if a compromise can be
worked out by Senators Ford and Robb regarding tobacco farmers, the same language would
then be inserted in comprehensive tobacco legislation that moves in the House. DPC and USDA
have been working with Senators Ford and Robb to encourage them to reach a compromise.
The DPC, OPL and USDA have also met with groups of tobacco farmers from North Carolina,
South Carolina and Tennessee, and will be meeting with the Georgia Farm Bureau this week, to
reinforce the Administration's commitment to protecting farmers. In addition, Secretary
Glickman is planning to travel to Kentucky on April 3, and will meet with tobacco farmers to
discuss tobacco legislation. Finally, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is holding a press
conference on Monday to announce a set of general principles they have agreed on with some
groups from the tobacco producer community. The goals of the coalition are "reducing disease
caused by tobacco products, and ensuring the future prosperity and stability of the American
tobacco farmer, the tobacco farm family, and tobacco farming communities." On Monday, the
press office will issue a statement from you commending the coalition's efforts to work towards
comprehensive tobacco control legislation that also protects the interests of farmers and their
communities.
