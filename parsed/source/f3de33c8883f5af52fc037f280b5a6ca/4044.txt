Elena--

I've reviewed the articles and memos you sent over to us.   Some responses:

1. Goodling op ed on national tests: Riley submitted a response letter
yesterday; we'll fax you a copy. Not clear if it will be published since
Goodling's piece was in response to the Post's masthead editorial
endorsing the tests.

2. Ibarra memo referencing governors of Alaska and Delaware: Secretary
Riley will likely announce Alaska's participation with Gov.  Knowles when
he is in Alaska next week (we had been saving this for a POTUS event but
heard yesterday that Knowles is getting frustrated because AK's
participation is never acknowledged) .  It's not clear what we should do
re: Carper, because his letter does not actually commit Delaware to
participating, it just says the national tests are a good idea and raises
some questions.

3. LA Times article on academic standards: I noticed the POTUS cc:d Judy
Winston on this.   Mike Smith mentioned that he thought it would be very
important to bring Judy in on the North Carolina situation as soon as
possible.   By any chance have you communicated with her about this? If
not, do you want one of us to?

Thanks.
