TEXT:
By "our budget proposal" , do you mean the President's budget?

If so, on the CAP proposal, then we would either have to tell the Defense
Dept. to fund it internally; or just say we want to spend this money even
though it wasn't in his budget.  If OMB were under instructions to do this
because it's a priority, I am sure they would find a way.  Without that,
there's a million reasons why it can't be done.

On the other parts of the draft executive order, I would pose the question
to the NEC of whether there is a way to write something that has goals for
employment, but doesn't raise red flags.
