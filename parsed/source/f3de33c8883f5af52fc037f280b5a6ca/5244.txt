1.      More money into CCDBG
2.      Maybe DCTC (not refundability, only adjustments of credit amount
and income slide)
3.      3 pronged quality initiative
        - $ for Enforcement
        - Scholarships
        - Research and Consumer Education
4.      Incentives to promote coordination of school-age programs.

I'll speak with you soon. Nicole and Signal will know how to reach me in
Florida. I assume I'll be back Friday night or Saturday. Thanks .
