TEXT:
Here is what the grass roots types are saying about Bliley's release of
the tobacco documents.   As I mentioned yesterday MN is helping guide
reporters through the documents.

To:   Interested Parties
Re:   Bliley Release of Minnesota Documents

      with the release of most, thought not all,' of the 39,000 documents
today
in a fashion designed to be least accessible and least usable to the
reader,
including members of the media and the public,'Congressman Thomas Bliley
appears to have sought to water down the impact that these documents will
have
on the tobacco industry. He appears deliberately to have denied
anti-tobacco
members of the House Commerce Committee an opportunity to first review the
documents and develop a guide to the most important ones prior to releasing
them en masse on the Internet.   It was purely in Bliley's discretion to
release the documents in this manner; he could have waited a few days and
permitted them to be processed more effectively.

     He did not wait.  The result is that today reporters must struggle
with
the impossible, which is to -- in the space of a few hours -- process
200,000
pages of material downloaded from the Internet and report accurately and
completely on them for the evening news and the morning papers.   Torn Bliley
and the tobacco industry .know that the greatest focus on the documents
will be
upon their initial release.   Less influential will be the incremental
reporting on important documents in the corning days and weeks as they
gradually are identified by members of the press.



     The result is that while the documents will certainly have their
effect,
the damage to the tobacco industry is mitigated to the extent possible, and
this can only help the tobacco lobby as it seeks to weaken tobacco control
legislation now moving on Capitol Hill. At the same time, the Congressman
from Philip Morris presents himself as "the new Tom Bliley" - tobacco
industry
antagonist, protector of children, paragon of full disclosure.
