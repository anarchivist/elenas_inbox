TEXT:
We understand the Ron Hill at USDA GC has a few more changes to the
language we worked out last night.  He's faxing those over shortly and
we'll forward to you as soon as we get them.

please let us know as soon as soon as possible any changes you think are
needed to USDA's language. We'll review concurrently.    Ron is back from
sick leave today.
