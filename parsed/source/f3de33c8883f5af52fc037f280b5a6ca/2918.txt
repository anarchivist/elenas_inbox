o    The Administration is closely monitoring the settlement talks among the tobacco
     industry, state attorneys general, public health groups, and private lawyers. Any
     agreement would have to be passed by the Congress and signed by the President.

o    We will carefully review any settlement that emerges from the discussions, and we will
     seek the advice of the public health community. As the President has said, in reviewing
     any settlement proposal, our focus will stay squarely on protecting kids and the public
     health.

Q.   Is the Administration trying to help close the deal?

A.   Absolutely not. The Administration is monitoring the talks closely, so that the President
     will be in a position to evaluate and respond to any possible settlement. But the
     Administration has not yet reached a judgment on the kind of settlement the parties
     appear to be discussing and is not trying to encourage or close the deal.

Q.   Have you started to review the deal?

A.   We have begun a process for reviewing the provisions that have been under discussion.
     We expect to spend the next couple of weeks analyzing the details as they emerge, and
     consulting with the public health community and others.

Q.   How will the review work and how long will it take?

A.   A number of the Federal agencies have a role in tobacco, so we will coordinate the review
     out of the White House. We will take as long as we need to take, but we will seek to
     work promptly and expeditiously.

Q.   Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop have asked in a letter to the President that you give them
     30 days to complete their own review before the President signs off on anything.
     Are you going to wait?

A.   The President has made clear that we would very closely consider the views of the public
     health community prior to rendering any judgment on a settlement, but we've been in
     contact with members of the community during the whole course of these discussions.
     We are not going to act before we know the views of the public health community,
     including Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler, but we have not decided on any particular timetable.
