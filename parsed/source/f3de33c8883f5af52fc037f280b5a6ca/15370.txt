         PARTNER BENEFITS HAVE A SURPRISING LACK OF TAKERS
         By Barbara Whitaker
              Although businesses are increasingly offering health benefits to the
         partners of unmarried employees, few workers are taking advantage of the
         plans.
              Participation was expected to be about 3 percent to 4 percent of the
         work
         force where such coverage was available, but it has turned out to range
         from
         half of a percent to 1 percent, said Andrew D. Sherman, a vice president in
         Boston for the Segal Co., an international benefits consulting firm that
         has
         worked with many companies on their plans.
               Generally, the fight for such benefits has been led by gay activists.
         But unmarried heterosexual couples can also qualify under some of these
         company policies.
              Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm in Lincolnshire, Ill.,
         has
         seen similar participation rates for partner policies, although it found
         that
         when heterosexual couples were included, the rate sometimes reached the
         expected 3 percent to 4 percent.
              An estimated 500 companies, including IBM, Apple Computer, Walt Disney
         and Levi Strauss, as well as many colleges, universities, states and
         municipalities, now offer health and other benefits to domestic partners.
         By
         all accounts, the number has grown rapidly over the last two years.
         According
         to Hewitt, about 20 percent to 30 percent of these plans include both
         same-sex and heterosexual couples.
              At Apple, participation has run well below the 5 percent predicted when
         the benefits program was first offered, in mid-1992. Gustavo De La Torre,
         director of multicultural programs there, said that only about 45 of the
         company's nearly 9,600 employees were using the program.
              Xerox, which offers employees $1,000 to buy health insurance on their
         own
         for a partner or dependent, said that only 200 of about 47,000 employees,
         or
         four-tenths of 1 percent, had signed up for that prosram. A~:'и~ ~3:~ l~2
         participants are domestic partners.
              So companies are finding that even though the benefits can be
         controversial, angering some cor:.c:~!:"и/:tи.:ivc groups, they are r.'-'': '.:-,~-'-::,::/
         expensive.
              Why aren't more employees persuaded to take the benefits? In part,


because both partners in the relationships tend to have jobs and access to
health insurance on their own. That, De La Torre said, appeared to be the
case at Apple.
     Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Campaign, a
Washington lobbying group on gay and lesbian issues, said there were
several
deterrents as well: unmarried employees generally have to pay tax on the
value of their partner's benefits and lesbian and gay employees may be wary
about revealing their sexual orientation to an employer out of fear of
discrimination.
     Clearly, cost is a big factor. The Internal Revenue Service considers
benefits awarded to an unmarried partner as taxable compensation unless the
partner qualifies as a "dependent," meaning that the employee provides more
than half of the partner's financial support. Married couples do not owe
taxes on such benefits.
     "The income tax implications are a big disincentive," said Sherman, of
Segal.
     Jenifa Johnson, an employee of Apple Computer for 10 years, said she
took
advantage of Apple's health benefits for her partner for one year before
canceling.
     "I did not know how big the taxes were going to be," said Ms, Johnson,
a
project manager with a team that is developing software for Apple's
Powerbook. "It ended up being about $1,200 taken out of my paycheck," she
said, in taxes based on the $2,500 value the IRS put on her partner's
benefits.
     The taxes were deducted quarterly, meaning a hit of $300 every three
months.
    Her partner, Bertina Bryant, now receives her own health insurance and
other benefits as a high school English teacher, but she preferred the
health
coverage at Apple. Ms. Johnson said her Apple coverage allows her to visit
the doctor of her choice and covers chiropractic care, among other things.
Ms. Bryant's school policy requires her to use a health maintenance
organization; the plan does not include vision care, and her dental
benefits
are half those of Apple's plan.
    Because the dental plan was available separately at Apple, Ms. Johnson
has continued that coverage for Ms. Bryant at a cost of about $350 a year
in
additional taxes.
    Taxes are not the only cost barrier. Some employees have found their
companies' domestic-benefit premiums to be too expensive.
    Lauren Black, who manages hardware testing and evaluation at Macworld
magazine in San Francisco, found that health insurance for her partner
would
cost more through her company, the International Data Group, than from the
outside. Her partner, Meredith Steiner, was unemployed, having been laid
off
from her job with a group raising funds to combat AIDS.
    Through the company, the cost would have been $76 a month, Ms. Black
said, with an additional $46 a mo~th in taxes. T~0 c~-r~:~en~ fn~ e~ch

benefits were available only through a different provider.
     But she remains a believer in the concept. "If I was looking to change
jobs or go to another company, I'd look for a ccmpan~' that offers d=mestic
partner benefits," she said.
     Some supporters of such benefits complain that the tax burd~n creates
an
inequitable situation in the workplace.
     "It's a matter of equal pay for work," said Richard Jennings, executive
director of Hollywood Supports, a group focusing on issues confronting gay
people in the entertainment business. "Until the federal government starts
recognizing where companies are today, people are not going to be able to
take advantage of these benefits as heterosexuals can."
     The disparity between married and unmarried couples is made more
glaring
because employers can treat their payments for health insurance as
deductible
business-related expenses, no matter the employee's relationship to the
insured.
     The Human Rights Campaign is studying the tax code to decide whether to
mount some kind of challenge. "I think it would take Congressional action,"
Ms. Birch said.
     For many employees, like Ms. Johnson and Ms. Bryant, the real value of
partners' benefits is as a safety net if one of them loses a job.
     Leslie Wright, a flavor analyst at the Coors Brewing Co. and a
co-chairwoman of an employee group called the Lesbian and Gay Employee
Resource, helped push the company to provide benefits to domestic partners,
but she doesn't use them.
     "My partner has full benefits with her company," Ms. Wright said. "If
my
partner wanted to change jobs, if I wanted to go back to school, I could
feel
more comfortable," because of the possibility of adding a partner to the
health plan -- and perhaps passing the dependency test to be exempt from
taxes.
     Still, deciding whether to add a partner to a benefits plan is not
just a
question of dollars and cents. Ms. Birch and others say many gay and
lesbian
couples do not take advantage of the workplace benefits for their partners
because they are afraid of employer discrimination.
     "There have to be basic workplace protections at the federal level,"
Ms.                ,
Birch said. "Today, you can be fired in 41 states simply because you're
gay,
lesbian or bisexual."
     To make gay and lesbian workers feel more comfortable about applying
for
partners' benefits, Ms. Birch said, Congress needs to pass the Employment
Nondiscrimination Act, which would add workplace protections for gay and
lesbian employees.
     Still, advocates of such measures say that adding benefits Lor
