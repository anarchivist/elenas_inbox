TEXT:
Congressman Smith has requested our presence at a meeting with Mel Watt
and Zoe Lofgren to discuss draft H1-B legislation that he plans to
introduce within the next several weeks.  The meeting has now been
scheduled for 4:30 pm on Thursday 4/22 in room 2231 RHOB.  I would suggest
that we meet for a pre-meeting to discuss our strategy prior to going up
to the Hill meeting.  I would also suggest that we include the appropriate
person/expert from DOL in both meetings.  please let me know if you have
any questions or concerns.  Peter
