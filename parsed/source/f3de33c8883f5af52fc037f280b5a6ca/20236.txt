 Subject:         Net Revenue Language for Gramm Amendment

 Here is language to modify the definition of net revenues in S. 1415 to
 specify that deposits into the tobacco trust fund are net of the costs of
 the Gramm amendment. This allows all of the existing percentage
 allocations of program spending from the fund to remain in place (although
 at lower dollar amounts, of course).




 Amendment to S. 1415 to Reduce Net Revenues for
  Marriage Penalty Tax Expenditure

 Amend Sec. 401 (c     (2) defining net revenues in the Tobacco Trust Fund as
 follows:

   (c)  Net Revenues;   For purposes of subsection (b), the term "net
 revenues" means the amount estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury
 based on the excess of

  (1) the amounts received in the Treasury under subsection (b), over

  (2) the decrease in the taxes imposed by chapter 1 and chapter 52 of the
 Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and other offsets, resulting from the
 amounts received under subsection (b). and
...
        (3) the decrease in the taxes imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal
       Revenue Code of 1986 resulting from the provisions of Title [XX] of this
       Act.
