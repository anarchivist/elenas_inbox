TEXT:
Sally and Elena, after you left the meeting yesterday Joe, Kathy, Pat and
I talked a bit about the principal's meeting. We are concerned that a
full interagency principal's meeting somewhat violates the request from
the Department of 'Commerce. They approached OMB at the beginning of this
process to say, "We're planning to publish some alternative poverty
measures based on the NAS recommendations. Do you (OMB or other policy
people at the WH) have any input you want to give us on those decisions
that involve policy issues as much as statistical issues?"  In short, the
request was a limited request -- not a request to set up a full
interagency working group to give advice to Commerce about what they
should publish.  The working group we established as a result was
explicitly EOP only (this was a very conscious decision) -- with Pat
Ruggles included because of her expertise on program eligibility issues.

Our advice is to call an EOP-only principals meeting on the issues we
discussed yesterday, including NEC, DPC, OMB, and CEA.    (This can always
be broadened l'ater -- but I think we shouldn't do that without explicitly
going back to the Dept of Commerce to talk with them about the process.)

On the other hand, a broader vetting of these poverty measure changes and
their possible implications with all of the relevant agencies also needs


to start ~mmediately.  perhaps at a joint NEC-DPC Principal's meeting
sometime soon, we can do a short briefing on the new "alternative poverty
line" plans of the Census and from there set up a broad Working Group (our
existing policy working group plus whatever agencies want to be involved)
to discuss all of questions about how a new poverty measure might impact
program issues.

Unless I hear otherwise, I'll assume we're heading toward a limited
EOP-only principal's meeting.  I'll be getting an options paper to you for
comments (along with Pat's one-pager on eligibility) within the next
couple of days.

                                        Becky
