Juvenile Justice


Q:      What does the Administration's juvenile justice proposal do?


A:      Last week, I sent my "Anti-Gang and Youth Violence Act of 1997" to Congress. My
legislation is a comprehensive strategy to break the back of violent gangs, reduce youth violence,
and provide our kids with positive alternatives to steer them away from gangs, guns, and drugs.

        Among many other measures, the strategy provides critical resources for state and local
prosecutors to target, prosecute, and convict violent youth gangs. It permits Federal prosecutors
to prosecute juveniles in adult court when they commit certain violent crimes.

        It also creates 1,000 afterschool initiatives to keep kids off the streets and give them
positive alternatives. It will give communities the resources and support to establish youth
curfews, anti-truancy efforts, create youth violence courts, and effective prevention initiatives.

       My legislation requires safety locks for handguns to prevent accidents and thefts and
extends the Brady Law so that violent juveniles can never own a handgun.


Q:     Can the Federal government actually have any impact on crime?

A:      Yes. Police chiefs, sheriffs, and rank -and-file officers from across the country will tell
you that the Clinton anti-crime agenda has made a difference in their efforts --- putting more cops
on the streets, longer sentences for violent offenders, and taking guns out of the hands of
dangerous criminals.

        Local prosecutors also know we can help them. That is why the nation's primary and
largest organization of prosecutors, the National District Attorneys Association, has
enthusiastically endorsed my proposal to launch a massive attack on gangs and violent crimes
by juveniles.


Q.      Durjng the campaign, you were able to neutralize the Republicans on the issue of crime --
an issue that they had traditionally dominated. Do you expect to continue to focus on this issue
in this Administration and if so, in what respect?

A.      I am very proud of our anti-crime record. We are past the midway point of funding
100,000 new police officers, and the Brady Bill has prevented over 186,000 felons, fugitives, and
stalkers from buying handguns. For the first time since 1960, the violent crime has fallen five
years in a row. We are moving in the right direction but we have a long way to go. That is
why we are going to continue to put more police officers on our streets and take guns, drugs, and
gangs off the streets. We are also going to continue our focus on youth violence. My
                                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                                      Hmt·Dwnp Conversion

            Anti-Gang and Youth Violence legislation, which I sent to Congress last week, will fulfill that
            mandate. My legislation is designed to keep kids drug-free, keep them away from guns and
            make the juvenile justice system tougher and smarter.


            Q:     What are the bipartisan Congressional task force 's chances for successfully enacting
            consensus juvenile justice reform legislation?

                   I believe the chances are good. While there are some areas of initial disagreement, there
            are many more areas where the Congressional Democrats, the Congressional Republicans and
            our Administration are in agreement. I look forward to working closely ~ith Congress to
            develop a comprehensive package that will make real progress in combating juvenile crime.
