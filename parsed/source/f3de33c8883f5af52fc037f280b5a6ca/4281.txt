 TEXT:
 I spoke to Eric Gould this morning. He and his boss are also concerned
 about the proposal weakening the work requirements, and want to work with
·us in deciding whether this is a battle to fight.

Eric pointed out something I think is important that connects with some of
the questions, Diana, that we discussed earlier -- that the legislation's
definition of work experience and community service programs is so broad
that nearly all work could be defined as such (particularly since the
private sector is included).   Thus this is a weakening of the work
requirements that could apply to all work. Could you get HHS' feedback on
that interpretation of the language?

Diana -- I also left on your chair a handwritten note of additional
questions that occurred to me while reading the legislation.
