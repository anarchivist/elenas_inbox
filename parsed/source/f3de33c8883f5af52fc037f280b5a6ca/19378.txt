TEXT:
Ellen Vargyas called today, and she wanted to start a working group to
start exploring ways to collect wage data.  She suggested that we could
have an initial meeting here with OMB, Labor, and EEOC.  After the initial
meeting, OMB, Labor, and Eooe could have some time to come up with some
options. After they have corne up with some options, then we could
circulate it to the other agencies.  What do you all think about setting
up the working group?
