TEXT:
In the House Labor HHS approps markup, an Istook amendment to require
parental consent for Title X family planning services passed 32-24.   (A
Porter substitute, which passed in 1997 and 1996, encouraging but not
requiring parental involvement, failed by a vote of 26-31.)

Lowey offered an amendment which passed providing allowing women to
designate ob/gyns as their primary care providers. This amendment applies
to group health plans, individual health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid.

The Rules Committee in the House issued a rule which will not protect
Lowey'S amendment to the Treasury/Postal approps bill regarding coverage
of contraceptives in FEHBP.   This means that it could be struck if anyone
raises a point of order. When the bill goes to the floor, the Democrats
and moderate Republicans plan to vote against the rule in the hopes of
sending it back to Committee.

Reid offered his FEHBP/contraceptives amendment in the Treasury-Postal
markup in the Senate. While Chairman Stevens said that he supported it,
he said that the Chairman of the Authorizing Subcommittee (Cochran)
opposed it.  So Reid withdrew his amendment and said he will offer it on
the floor.
