                  THE PRICE EVALUATION ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM

        A key component of the Clinton administration's reform of the federal government's
procurement programs is its new price evaluation adjustment program. Congress authorized all
federal agencies to use this program in 1994 as part of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act.
The first phase of the program, which is being implemented through a revision of the Federal
Acquisition Regulation, goes into effect on _ _ __

        Under this new program, small disadvantaged businesses ("SDB's") bidding on
competitively awarded federal contracts may qualify for a price evaluation credit of up to 10%.
Credits will be available only to businesses that have been certified as SDB's by the Small
Business Administration. These credits help level the playing field for minority groups who have
encountered discrimination in their efforts to compete. Although they may receive these credits,
SDB's must compete with all other businesses to win federal contracts. Price evaluation credits
are not set-asides. They do not assure that any firm, or group of firms, will win a contract.Only if
price credits fail to remedy discrimination can agencies consider the use of set-asides in awarding
contracts to SDB's.

         In order to ensure that the use ofthese credits is fair and meets legal requirements, they
will be available only in industries in which minority-owned firms continue to suffer the effects
of discrimination. "Benchmarking" provides a methodology for identifying these industries by
comparing the actual federal procurement market share of minority-owned businesses with the
federal procurement market share that would be expected in the absence of discrimination.
Credits will be available only in industries where the actual federal procurement market share
(''utilization'') falls short of the expected federal procurement market share ("capacity").

Constitutional Requirements

        The administration developed this benchmarking methodology to ensure that federal
procurement complies with the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena.
In Adarand, the Court held that it is constitutional to provide targeted assistance to
minority-owned businesses as long as two requirements are met. The first is that the assistance
must serve a "compelling interest." This requirement is satisfied if there has been discrimination
that has harmed minority business owners in the particular industry where assistance is to be
provided. The second requirement is that the remedy is "narrowly tailored," that is, any
assistance targeted to members of a certain race or ethnic group must be necessary to remedy
discrimination and must be carefully designed to address its effects .

      . A, Compelling Interest

       Based on an extensive review of evidence, the Department of Justice has established that
discrimination has harmed minority businesses. In addition to commissioning an analysis of
dozens of studies of industries throughout the country, DOJ also reviewed a long history of


                                                 1
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

Congressional findings of discrimination. Congress relied on these findings in enacting
affirmative action and other remedial legislation. For example, there is substantial evidence that
minority-owned businesses have been prevented from obtaining access to capital, from
participating in trade associations, and from gaining enough experience to become bonded. Most
of the present effects of discrimination stem from discrimination in the private sector, not in the
public sector. These limitations have erected substantia) barriers to minority-owned firms and
have hampered their ability to win contracts. Consistent with Congress's long-standing
determinations, the government has a compelling interest in providing targeted assistance to
minority-owned businesses.

       B. Narrow Tailoring

        The use of benchmarks helps satisfy the Supreme Court's "narrow tailoring" requirement
by providing a means for determining whether the effects of discrimination still burden small
minority-owned businesses in a particular market. Credits will be available only in those markets
where it is still necessary to offset the effects of discrimination. Based on FY 1996 data, the
Department of Commerce estimates that industries representing about 74% of federal contract
dollars awarded to SDB's will be eligible for price credits. The capacity and utilization of
minority-owned businesses in 70 two digit SIC code groups and nine Census divisions for each
of the three construction two digit SIC code groups were determined by analyzing data
representing the firms in the United States that bid on federal contracts or participated in the 8(a)
programs administered by the Small Business Administration. This group of firms represents
those that were prepared to perform federal contracts in FY 1996.

        The "utilization" ofSDB's is simply a measure of the total dollar value of the federal
contracts awarded to them in FY 1996. Calculating the "capacity" of these firms is more
complex. In order to estimate capacity, the benchmarks take into account various characteristics
of firms that bear directly on the value of contracts that they receive, including the age and size of
the firm. This approach allows Commerce Department statisticians to estimate the value of
contracts an SDB would be expected to receive if its success in winning federal contracts equaled
that of all other firms in the industry of equal age and size. An outside panel of statisticians and
economists reviewed this methodology and concluded that it was the best approach possible.

 The Scope of the Program

        Three agencies, the Department of Defense, NASA, and the Coast Guard have had
authorization to offer credits since FY 1994. Under the rule announced today, all agencies will be
required to implement the price evaluation credit program. Currently, data are available to allow
application of the program to SDB prime contractors. The availability of credits will be extended
to SDB subcontractors on November I, 1998. Sometime during the next year, the Small Business
Administration will also use benchmarks in administering the 8(a) program. Benchmarks will
provide guidance to program administrators, for example, in determining the number and type of
firms that will participate in the program and in deciding what contracts will be authorized under


                                                  2
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


the program. The federal benchmarks will not apply to the Department of Transportation's
program for Disadvantaged Business Enterprises, which is administered by grantees, such as
state and local governments.

The Advantages of Benchmarking

       The benchmarking/price evaluation adjustment program offers several advantages in
designing government affirmative action programs to assist SDB's.

        Constitutionality -- The program responds to the core concerns about
procurement-related affirmative action programs expressed by the Supreme Court. The Court has
made clear that government may remedy discrimination by the government itself or by the
private sector. However, the Court has also indicated that any affirmative action program should
be designed to address the actual effects of past discrimination. Benchmarking provides a means
for carefully targeting our efforts to remedy those effects.

        Flexibility -- Benchmarks are not quotas. The price evaluation adjustment program
includes a series of provisions designed to target assistance carefully, to ensure flexibility and to
maintain vigorous competition. Price credits will not be available in all industries, only those
where there is evidence of remaining effects of discrimination. Price credits will be available
only when the government has concluded that race-neutral efforts are inadequate to address past
discrimination. Even in cases when utilization falls short of capacity in a major industry
grouping, the relevant agencies retain discretion to adjust or eliminate the credit under some
circumstances.

       Preserving Competition -- Price and evaluation adjustments are not set-asides. No firm
or group of firms is guaranteed any contract. These credits provide a small boost for
minority-owned firms when there has been a record of past discrimination. However, these firms
must compete with all other firms for contracts. Only if the use of these credits fail to remedy
discrimination are set-asides an option. As a result, government can make good faith efforts to
remedy prior discrimination, while preserving the incentives for firms to compete vigorously for
taxpayer dollars.

        Periodic Review -- Federal procurement data will be reviewed periodically to ensure that
price credits are available only in those industries where the effects of discrimination persist.

Industries Where Credits are Available

        Benchmarking estimates are based on two digit SIC code groups. With the exception of
construction, for which regional benchmarks have been developed, the estimates are for the
nation as a whole. Based on these benchmarks, the Department of Commerce has identified the
industries in which credits will be available. A table showing these industries appears in the
Federal Register of June _ , 1998.
