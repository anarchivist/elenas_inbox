                           PRESIDENT CLINTON:
              EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR NATIONAL SERVICE
                              **2/9 DRAFT**

Today, at the University of Maryland, College Park, President Clinton called on Congress to
expand the yearly participation level in AmeriCorps to 100,000 members by 2002. He also
kicked-off AmeriCorps' largest national recruitment campaign to challenge young people to
provide service to their communities.

EXPANDING AMERICORPS TO GIVE MORE AMERICANS A CHANCE TO SERVE.
When he came into office in 1993, President Clinton outlined a vision for a national service
program that linked responsibility to opportunity by allowing young people to serve our
nation while earning funds for a college education. The result of that vision is AmeriCorps,
which is bringing people of different racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds together to
solve community problems and improve the lives of Americans. In the four years since its
launch, over 100,000 AmeriCorps members have served to give children the tools they need
to succeed, including teaching them how to read, organizing quality after-school programs,
mentoring students and to strengthen communities by making schools and streets safer,
building affordable housing, and mobilizing community volunteers.

The President seeks to build on this success by creating more opportunities for Americans
to serve through AmeriCorps. President Clinton's budget proposes to expand
AmeriCorps to nearly 70,000 members by the year 2000, with the goal of reaching 100,000
members serving each year by 2002. This expansion will also allow high school students to
join AmeriCorps-- by serving part-time during the school year and full-time during the
summer. The FY 2000 budget request includes $585 million for AmeriCorps, an increase
of $113 million over last year.

A CALL TO SERVICE CAMPAIGN. President Clinton announced the launch of the
AmeriCorps Call To Service campaign, the largest-ever national recruitment drive for
AmeriCorps. The President challenged all Americans, especially young people, to get
involved in service. The Call to Service campaign will provide young people with
information on how they can serve in AmeriCorps to help strengthen local communities.
The campaign includes a new television public service announcement produced by MTV,
print advertisements, campus visits and other local recruitment efforts.

A PROVEN RECORD OF SUCCESS. In just four years, over 100,000 young people have
joined AmeriCorps to serve more than 4,000 communities. AmeriCorps provides needed
human resources to schools churches, community groups and nonprofit orgranizations,
including Habitat for Humanity, Big Brother/Big Sister and the American Red Cross. A
recent evaluation confinns that AmeriCorps strengthens communities in many ways: building
leadership, citizenship, and other important skills; and making community organizations more
effective. Since 1994, AmeriCorps members have served more than 32 million people,
mobilized nearly 2 million volunteers, taught, tutored or mentored more than 2 million children,
organized after-school programs for more than a half million at-risk youth, helped more than
200,000 senior citizens live independently and built or rehabilitated more than 25,000 homes.
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

After a year of full-time service, AmeriCorps members receive education awards to help finance
college or pay back student loans.
