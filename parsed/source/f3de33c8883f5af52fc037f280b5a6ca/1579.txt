TEXT:
Ron Klain wants to know if Gore can sign the letter with POTUS.  I talked
to Phil Calplan and he said that would be unusual.  The only time he
remembers a letter going out from them both was to Federal employees after
the government shut down.  It would be easy to say no if it is not
appropriate from a legal standpoint.  Should we check with Kathy Wallman
too? Please advise.
