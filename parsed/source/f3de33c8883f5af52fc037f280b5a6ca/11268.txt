TEXT:
As we have discussed, the FY2000 budget request for our international AIDS
efforts is problematic. The Child Survival and Disease Fund, from which
USAID'supports its AIDS programs, went down substantially because it did
not include $10 million insupplemental funding allocated to an AIDS orphan
initiative (announced by the President on 12/1/98).

USAID - Child Survival FY99      FYOO
Child Survival and Disease Fund (base)   $545    $555
Emerg. supplemental child survival funding
      ($10 of the $50 allocated to AIDS orphans) $50    $0
Total    $595    $555

USAID determines its allocations for AIDS funding, and is telling
appropriators that its FYOO AIDS budget will be $127 million (up from $125
in FY99). The community has already written us about this, arguing that
it's not "up $2" but "down 8."

USAID - AIDS    FY99    FYOO
AIDS budget (base)      $125    $127
Emerg. supplemental child survival funding allocated to AIDS orphans       $10        $0
Total   $135    $127

Rep. Pelosi's office, which requested that $10 of the $50 million
emergency supplemental funding go for AIDS orphans, is concerned that we
(1) don't just push for AIDS money at the expense of other diseases, and
(2) don't aggravate the Republican appropriators who got the $50 million
(esp. Rep. Callahan) by asking for only AIDS money and not more child
survival money overall.

OMB feels that USAID has been trimmed pretty tightly over the last five
years and would be challenged to corne up with an additional $10 to $15
million without cutting into some other worthwhile program. We share that
concern. During Sandy's recent trip to Africa, USAID folks on the ground
expressed a lot of concern that we not just take money from their left
hand and put it into their right."

What we do want is for us to support efforts to increase the child
survival funding in the Congressional review process. USAID can probably
help by corning up with some of the money on its own, but we'll need to
assist by identifying potential offsets outside of child survival (and
perhaps outside of USAID) .
·
At a minimum, we think that the AIDS budget needs to go up to $135
million, which is the FY99 base of $125 plus the $10 emergency orphan
funding.

Any help you can render would be greatly appreciated.
