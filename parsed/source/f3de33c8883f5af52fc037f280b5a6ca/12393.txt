TEXT:
I called you to talk about education chapter.   It would be helpful for
someone in your 'shop to try a minimalist approach to fixing the chapter to
your satisfaction.

For starters, this would mean making sure that ESEA is discussed and
highlighted in a way that you guys are comfortable with rather than in the
fairly cursory way it's dealt with now.

To the extent you could edit the Compact so that it was consistent with
our ESEA approach that would be useful as well.

Can you call me to discuss?    tds
