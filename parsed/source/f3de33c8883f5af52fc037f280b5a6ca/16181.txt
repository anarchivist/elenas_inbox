TEXT:
By now you should have received for review a draft bill related to
applicants for suspension of deportation.

Background

Prior to the enactment of the 1996 immigration bill, suspension of
deportation could be granted at the discretion of an immigration judge to
aliens who had been present in the u.s. for seven years, have a good moral
character and demonstrate that deportation would cause "extreme hardship"
to the alien, or spouse, parent, or child who is a lawful permanent
resident or U.S. citizen. The 1996 immigration bill tightens the
standards for relief from deportation by requiring the alien to show
continuous physical presence and good moral character for ten years and to
demonstrate that removal would cause "exceptional and extremely unusual
hardship" to a lawful permanent resident or u.s. citizen spouse, parent,
or child.  In addition, immigration judges are only permitted to grant
relief from deportation in 4,000 cases per year. The new standards for
suspension of deportation became effective on April, 1, 1997.

Summary of Draft Bill

The draft bill would apply the old standards (pre 1996 immigration bill)
for suspension of deportation to cases that were in the administrative
pipeline prior to April 1, 1997.  In addition, the cap of 4,000 cases per
year for deportation relief would not apply to cases in the pipeline prior
to April 1, 1997, or to battered spouses and children.

Status

LR will be preparing the draft bill for Presidential transmittal early
next week. We therefore will need your comments on the draft bill package
today.

According to WHLA and Justice the Attorney General will announce the draft
bill in press briefings being held today and tomorrow.

WHLA has also notified LR that Justice is preparing a letter (for
expedited OMB clearance and transmittal today) from the Attorney General
to Speaker Gingrich laying out the different types of administrative
relief and an explanation of legislative alternative that the Department
is pursuing or considering with regard to suspension of deportation cases.

will keep you posted on any further developments.
