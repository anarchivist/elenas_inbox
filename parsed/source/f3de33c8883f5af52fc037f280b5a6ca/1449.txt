TEXT:
The OMB director has apparently at last opined on the "bucket" issue --
i.e., whether there is an administrative way to allow more people losing
SSI to keep Medicaid.

Raines endorsed HHS's partial fix, which we've also been pushing.  (HHS
rejected on legal grounds the advocates' argument that we could do a total
fix, where no one would lose Medicaid as a result of losing SSI.)  This
partial fix would create a temporary "bucket" for everyone losing SSI (for
a year, I think). And it would beef up what is included in a "medically
needy" program in a way that would help a group of states.

The effect of this will be to convert part of our fix package from
legislative to administrative.  It also means health providers will be
less interested in our package.

OMB doesn't think we should announce anything in the next week or two,
because CBO is doing some baseline reestimate.

While we have never been certain that this confusing issue could be
packaged into some kind of announcement or event, OMB would apparently
oppose making a big deal about this publicly. They are nervous that we'll
be criticized. Not sure this makes sense.

This should NOT be announced or alluded to in our legal immigration
briefing tomorrow.
