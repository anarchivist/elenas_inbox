  TEXT:
  I will send you both the latest copy of the   Reponse to the NAS Report on
  Food Safety. Elena had been concerned that    the report was too negative in
  its assessment of factors that needed to be   considered before we performed
  any organizational restructuring.  Below is   the revised language:


  Factors to Consider in Organizational Restructuring

 The Council assessment of structural and organizational options must take
 into consideration the following factors:

  There are numerous instances in the existing food safety system where the
 division of regulatory responsibility is not optimal.  For example, within
 the same plant, FSIS and FDA inspectors are often responsible for
 different foods.  FDA and FSIS also share regulatory responsibility of
 eggs and egg products. Examples such as these create stakeholder
 confusion and inefficient allocation of resources. Any reorganization
 must consider areas where there is significant jurisdictional overlap.
 Many food safety issues would be difficult to resolve in reorganization.
 For example, some issues like bovine spongiform encephalopathy are both
 animal health issues and human health issues.  Foodborne disease problems
 may also be waterborne disease problems. Other programs, particularly
 research and education programs for food safety often do not operate as
 separate activities within the agencies, but rather draw significant
 strength from one another.  While some projects are entirely focused on
 food safety, the food safety research portfolio includes many other
 projects in such areas as animal health and animal genetics.
 Reorganization must also accommodate successful partnerships such as the
 Partnership for Food Safety Education.
