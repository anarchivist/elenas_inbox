MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report




        Education -- National Testing: Goodling's bill to prohibit further development of
national tests without specific authorization, beyond what was explicitly agreed to in the FY98
appropriations bill, passed by a vote of242-174. Twenty-five Democrats (mostly conservative)
joined all but 2 Republicans to support Goodling. Both the Black and Hispanic Caucuses
opposed Goodling's bill, partly in recognition of the substantial and targeted education
investments in your budget, and partly because they viewed Goodling's bill as a partisan effort to
embarrass the Administration. However, this vote does not represent a fundamental change in
position for either caucus; when we face more substantive votes on national tests in the future,
we will not gain their votes without address their policy concerns, such as a ban on high stakes
testing and development of Spanish-language reading tests.

       Education -- Coverdell Education IRA's: (Laura and Elena: consider this a
placeholder until after the meeting on Friday with Erskine). Coverdell's proposal for education
IRA's will be marked-up by the Senate Finance Committee next week .....

         Child Care -- Current Legislation_ On Thursday, Senator Dodd and a group of 24
Democratic Senators introduced child care legislation similar both to your proposal and to the
Chafee bill introduced last week. While the Dodd bill is substantially similar to your child care
initiative, it has some differences: (1) the dependent care tax credit is made refundable and
reformed to provide assistance to stay-at-home parents; (2) the Family and Medical Leave Act
threshold is lowered to cover businesses of25 or more employees; (3) after-school programs are
enhanced both through the 21st Century Learning Center Program and through a set-aside in the
block grant; and (4) a new fund is created to promote public-private partnerships in child care.
In addition, on Tuesday, Congresswoman Nancy Johnson introduced the Chafee bill in the
House.
                                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
        Drugs -- Home Drug Tests: Next week, HHSIFDA is planning to release a proposed
regulation for "home drug test kits." HHSIFDA intends to codify its policy of the past year to
allow manufacturers to market these kits without prior FDA approval so long as they meet 3
conditions:

       1. That one of the more than 200 already FDA-approved testing procedures is used;
       2. That one of the 70 FDA-certified labs determine the results; and
       3. That the kits themselves be accurately labeled.

Interested parties will have 90-days to comment on this proposed regulation, and HHS/FDA will
also conduct a public hearing on home drug test kits during this time -- and before issuing a final
regulation. Under the proposed regulation, Sunny Cloud -- the individual who initially
challenged HHS/FDA's -- could continue to market her home drug test kits; however, proponents
of hair testing, which is not currently approved by the FDA, are likely to be unhappy with the
regulation. The proposed regulation has no impact on law enforc{!ment-related drug tests.
