Subject:         Food stamp fix legislation

OMB and USDA have drafted legislation to implement the President's
proposed "fix" to the food stamp 18-50 work requirement.  I was surprised
to discover that the current draft includes 2 changes to the welfare law
that seem unrelated to the basic goal (which is changing the ban from "3
months in 36" to "6 months in 12," and setting up a real work program for
these folks).  These 2 changes are:

changing the criteria for getting waivers from the fs work requirement.
Now the law allows 2 ways to get waivers:   (1) areas with an unemployment
rate over 10%, or (2) areas with insufficient numbers of jobs.   This draft
changes the 10% to 8%.  It turns out that most of the areas that would
helped by such a change are areas that would already qualify under method
2.  So why should we create a target for criticism when it doesn't even
make much difference?
allowing job search to count for 10 of the 20 hours of work activities.
Under current law, you can avoid the cutoffs if you are engaged in work
activities for at least 20 hours a week, but none of this can be job
search. We fought against this during the debate.    But, now that the law
is passed, it's not clear to me we would want to reopen this.   I don't
know how different this area is from TANF, where we clearly wouldn't allow
this.  But this was not part of what we advertised on this "fix", so I
don't see why we should reopen old wounds.   It will be tough enough to get
Congress to look at this in the first place!

The "rush" here is that Raines is very anxious to get the Administration
bill up to the Hill by the end of the week.  I have told OMB to hold this
because we may have problems.  Should I tell them we want these changes
deleted?
