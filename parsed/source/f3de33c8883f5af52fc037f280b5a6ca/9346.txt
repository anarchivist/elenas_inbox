TEXT:
Sen. Lautenberg would like the WH to help get language into the DC
approps bill that would enable DC to sue tobacco companies.  Lautenberg,
who is working with DC Rep. Norton, was planning to offer a floor
amendment, but Faircloth learned of the possible amendment and has
maneuvered the bill to avoid Lautenberg's amendment. Lautenberg is urging
the WH to help add his amendment during negotiations to enact the 13
spending bills.  I have Lautenberg's proposed amendment.
