TEXT:
Elena,

I am faxing a letter (from John Hope Franklin to the President) to you at
6-2878 tonight.   In the letter Franklin makes recommendations to the
President (p.2) regarding civil rights enforcement and data collection.
The Race Initiative intends to make this letter public at tomorrow's
 (Wednesday's) advisory board meeting, and Sylvia wanted you to look at
what Franklin proposes to be sure that you are okay with it.   (By this, I
think she means that we can be responsive to his concerns, even if we
can't do exactly what he suggests).   Please call me (6-1984) or send a
note indicating whether you have any concerns about making this letter
public, or anything contained within the substance of the letter.

Thanks.
