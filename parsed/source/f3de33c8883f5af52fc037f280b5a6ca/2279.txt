You asked for an update on Texas legislative activity:

On Monday, the Texas State Senate is expected to consider an amendment
reported out of Committee May 14th and supported by Gov. Bush which would
expressly authorize the privatization of computer systems and would allow
further privatization pending federal approval.   Democrats are expected
to offer a substitute which would limit privatization to computer systems
and technical assistance for an intergrated enrollment system --- similar
to the House amendment which passed the first week of May.   The legisla
ture ts scheduled to go out of session June 2.
