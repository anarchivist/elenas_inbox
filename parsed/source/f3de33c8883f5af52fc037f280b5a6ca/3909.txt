TEXT:
At yesterday's scheduling mtg, the President said he wanted to put as much
focus on education as he could in September, while America's thinking
about it. He suggested that we consider having him do a charter school
event in the Bay Area while he's out there to take Chelsea to Stanford.
Bill, can you and Schnur look into the possibilities, and see if this is
possible? If it is, we should save that charter schools $ to announce
there.

His other idea was to squeeze something into the Arkansas trip.    Any
ideas?

Rahm and Erskine are counting on us being ready to announce an amicus
brief in N.C. for the Sept 8th event ...
