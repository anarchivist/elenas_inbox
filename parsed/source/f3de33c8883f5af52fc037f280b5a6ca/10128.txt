TEXT:
I wanted to update you on an issue we have had a few conversations about
with Cecilia Rouse at NEC.  The Department of Education recently received
$5 million to give gran~s to institutions of higher education to help them
provide campus-based child care for low-income students (authorized during
the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act).   Ceci, at Gene's
request, is looking for proposals to support low-income workers who are
seeking additional education and training, and has discovered that this
may be a useful program to build on.   (I think that happened after I told
her that she should not expand CCDBG or DCTC for this purpose alone.)   She
has asked the Department of Education to develop a proposal to expand this
program and, though not yet approved by the Department, they are thinking
about raising the funding level to $40 million. My view is that this is a
good program that serves a real need, though I think the jump to $40
million is a bit much given all of the budget constraints. Thoughts?
