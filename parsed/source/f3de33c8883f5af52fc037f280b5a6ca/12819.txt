TEXT:
please remember, you MUST give your interns a policy, substantive research
project that they can work on all summer long (including health care).   I
want to know what these projects are by next Friday (4th) bye-mail.
Those who do not provide your intern with a project by then, I will take
away your intern privileges, no kidding.
