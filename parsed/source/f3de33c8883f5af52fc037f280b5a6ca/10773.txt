                                   $300 million for growers'
                                   fund

                                   By David Rice

                                   JOURNAL REPORTER

                                   Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the nation's largest
           cigarette-maker,
                                   announced yesterday that it will contribute $300
           million to a trust
                                   fund to help tobacco growers, making it the first of
           the large
                                   tobacco companies to formally put up money for
           growers.

                                   The move comes as cigarette companies and governors
           from
                                   tobacco states prepare for more meetings next week
           to discuss a
                                   $5 billion trust fund to compensate growers and
           allotment holders.
                                   Demand for their crop is subsiding in the wake of a
           nationwide,
                                   $206 bil-

                                   lion settlement that places new restrictions on
           tobacco.

                                   , 'They are saying that to go ahead and provide some
           immediate
                                   help, they will go ahead and contribute their 50
           percent of the first


                       year's payment,"   said Phil Carlton, the former N.C.
Supreme
                       Court justice who has represented the industry in
the talks.

                       Philip Morris' contribution alone will mean almost
$120 million for
                       North Carolina, which produces more tobacco than any
other
                       state and accounts for about 40 percent of the
domestic-tobacco
                       market.

                       Based on the buying intentions of tobacco companies,
federal
                       officials have announced an 18 percent cut for this
year in
                       allotments for flue-cured tobacco, the main form of
leaf grown in
                       North Carolina.

                       The companies told the government yesterday that
they also intend
                       to buy 31 percent less mountain-grown burley tobacco
next year
                       than they will this year.

                       With the exception of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. --
which
                       contends that it would rather buy more tobacco from
domestic
                       growers than contribute money to a bureaucratic
trust fund
                       other major tobacco companies have endorsed the
trust-fund
                       concept.

                       Carlton will outline how the trust fund will work at
the meeting
                       scheduled to begin Wednesday in Durham.

                       If all the major companies agree to contribute to
the growers' trust
                       fund over the next 10 years, the first year's
payments would total
                       $600 million, Carlton said. If the other companies
follow the same
                       formula that Philip Morris has, he said,   "you could
pay every
                       grower the average profit per pound and every quota
holder the
                       average rent per pound. ' ,

                       OFFICIALS IN EACH tobacco-growing state, however,
will
                       decide how the money is allocated among growers and
allotment
                       holders, Carlton said.

                       N.C. Attorney General Mike Easley, who with seven


other state
                           attorneys general helped negotiate the $206 billion
settlement,
                           called Philip Morris' action' 'a good first step in
the right direction.' ,

                           Easley attributed Philip Morris' action, at least in
part, to a
                           resolution signed by the leaders of various grower
groups last
                           week in support of the trust-fund approach. One
group had held
                           out for $12 billion in aid for tobacco growers, but
Easley said that
                           Reynolds' stance helped unite the growers.

                      " I don't think this is designed to pressure
Reynolds as much as it is
                      a recognition of the necessity of a trust fund,
given the fact that
                      both burley and flue-cured tobacco have had a cut of
more than
                      30 percent over the last two years. ' ,

                           Graham Boyd, the executive vice president of the
Tobacco
                           Growers Association of North Carolina, said he
expects a
                           favorable reaction from growers.   " I think Philip
Morris is
                           acknowledging that there is some real legitimate
need out there for
                           the growers, "   Boyd said.

                           AND FOR GOV. JIM HUNT, who has represented North
                           Carolina growers in the negotiations over farmer
aid,   " i t assists him
                           in the opportunity to pursue an actual trust fund,"
Boyd said.    "I
                           think it shows Reynolds that there's a pretty strong
position out
                           there. ' ,

                           But officials at R.J. Reynolds gave no indication
yesterday that
                           their stance has changed.

                           Reynolds announced its intent last month to buy 10
percent more
                           domestic leaf than it had the year before and to buy
that amount as
                           a minimum for the next 10 years.

                           "The fact is we agreed to buy more, and yet the
quota got cut
                           severely. Obviously, we stood alone on that, "    said
Nat Walker, a
                           spokesman for Reynolds.

                           , 'Our effort was to have a plan where, if all the
, .

      companies would
                                agree to buy more domestic tobacco .     . then there
      would not be
                                such a huge quota cut. ' ,

                                Instead of the complications involved with donating
      money to a
                                trust fund and then deciding how that money will be
      redistributed,
                                Walker said,    "Our thought was that money goes into
      tobacco
                                growers and farming communities, and that helps to
      prevent
                                problems. ' ,

                                But Walker, too, said that Reynolds hopes to be
      close to .resolving
                                the matter by the end of the two-day meeting with
      governors and
                                state agriculture commissioners next week.

                                " I don't think there is any difference among the
      companies about
                                what the problem is, and that it ought to be
      resolved, "    he said.
                                "The difference is what approach to take."

           01/16/99 Companies Plan To Buy A Third Less Burley
           Lexington Herald-Leader
                Farm leaders yesterday predicted that lower buying intentions
                -- down 130 million pounds from last year -- could translate
                to a quota cut ranging from 20 percent to 34 percent. That
                would be a staggering blow to the crop that has brought nearly
                a billion dollars into the state in recent years. --It's just
                devastating, " said Rod Kuegel, president of the
                Lexington-based Burley Tobacco Growers Cooperative
                Association. --They've basically just told one out of three
                tobacco growers that they don't need them anymore."
