TEXT:
Katie is out of town, but wanted me to give all of you a heads-up
about action that USDA is considering taking to address public
concerns over the alvage side of the rider.
Their idea is that the Secretary would direct the Forest Service
to engage in an internal review of salvage sales, focusing on the
kinds of complaints they're hearing from the public, and while
that review was on-going, salvage sales in 3 categories would be
suspended: a)   sales that had been previously prepared as green
sales, but were bieng prepared nad advertised as salvage sales
under the rider; b) sales that the Forest Service had decided not
to proceed with prior to the rider due to environmental concerns,
but were going forward wlunder the rider; c) sales in inventoried
roadless areas.
After this review was complete, the recommendations would go to an
interagency team that (meanwhile) will be reviewing implementation
of the interagency MOA signed in August for salvage sales. The
interagency team would review the recommenations, make suggestions
- and then the recommendations would go the Secretary.
Justice and USDA lawyers are working withe Secretary's office on
this, and BLM's Chief of Staff is working to see whether BLM has
sales tha tmight fall under the potential suspension categories,
but other than that, this proposal is being kept close hold for
now. Jack Ward Thomas has been out of town; he's been called back
to discuss this tommorrow and then USDA will decide how and when
to proceed. Before anything was announced, USDA would anticipate
briefing hill Democrats.
