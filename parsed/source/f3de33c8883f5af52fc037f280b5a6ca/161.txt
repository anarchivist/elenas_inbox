TEXT:
We will shortly be faxing you USDA's draft press release and Q&A's
on the salvage directive.  Based on our initial comments, USDA is
revising the package and we hope to have a re-draft to send out by
1. One way or the other, we'll send out the package by 1:30.
Because we're aiming to tee up this announcement for Monday - or
Tuesday at the latest, we're asking for comments back by c.o.b.
today if at all possible.  please let us know if this isn't
possible. Thanks.
