        Congress Approves Education Bill

                                    By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer

                                    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress approved its first
                                    substantive legislation of the year Wednesday, a
        measure that
                                    would give states more freedom in how they spend
        federal
                                    education dollars.

                                    The House approved the "Ed-Flex"   bill 368-57,
        and the
                                    Senate 98-1, with many lawmakers saying the
        shootings at a
                                    Denver area high school Tuesday further
        justified the need to
                                    work for better schools,

                                    President Clinton said he would sign it
        , 'wi thout delay,' ,

                                    " I am particularly pleased that the conference
        report
                                    strengthens accountability measures and
        preserves our effort to
                                    reduce class size in the early grades, "   Clinton
        said in a
                                    statement released by the White House. "The
        bipartisan work
                                    on this legislation shows we can and must work
        together to
                                    improve our nation's schools."

                                    Republicans, eager to show their commitment to
        education and
                                    other post-impeachment legislative priorities,
        hailed the bill's
                                    passage, To enhance the measure's chances, GOP
        leaders had
                                    to give up a major provision that exposed it to
        a presidential


                           veto.

                           The bill would enable states and school
districts to be released
                           from some rules that ordinarily must be met to
obtain federal
                           funding. In exchange,   they would have to set up
their own
                           programs under which they would be accountable
for better
                           educational results.

                           It would expand to all 50 states and the
District of Columbia a
                           demonstration program set up in 1994 that was
limi ted to 12
                           states.

                           This Congress has passed a Republican budget
outline for the
                           coming fiscal year, but this would be the first
major piece of
                           legislation to go to Clinton for his signature.

                           While taking only a small step toward the
Republican goal of
                          returning more education money and
responsibility to states and
                          local school districts, GOP leaders praised the
House action.

                           "In the last two years we had the most
effective education
                           effort in the history of the Congress of the
united States, "   said
                           Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the
House
                           Education and Workforce Committee. He cited this
bill and
                           legislation on vocational training, Head Start,
charter schools
                           and child nutrition, among others.

                           To avoid a presidential veto, a House-Senate
conference
                           abandoned a provision promoted by Senate
Majority Leader
                           Trent Lott, R-Miss., that Democrats said would
undermine
                           Clinton's drive to hire 100,000 new teachers to
reduce class
                           sizes.

                           Lott's measure would have let schools take some
of the $1. 2
                           billion allocated for this year to hire some of
the 100,000
                           teachers and spend it instead on special
education needs. In
                           place of that, the bill says small districts


with class sizes of 18 or
                            fewer students may join with other districts to
use the money
                            for teacher training.

                            To participate in the Ed-Flex program under the
bill, states
                            would have to apply to the Education secretary
for a waiver
                            from the normal rules, explaining what
educational goals would
                            be achieved and how progress toward those goals
would be
                            evaluated. The waiver could be revoked after
three years if the
                            secretary concludes the state is not meeting its
objectives.

                            "We believe it will provide schools and their
students with the
                            tools to improve academic achievement, "    said
Rep. Michael
                            Castle, R-Del., who co-sponsored the bill with
Rep. Tim
                            Roemer, D-Ind. " I t allows local schools and
districts to think
                            outside the box."

                            But some Democrats said they opposed the trend
of reducing
                            the federal role in improving performance in
public schools,
                            particularly in poorer school districts.

                            Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.,   the only senator
to vote against
                            the bill, said Congress was abandoning "a value
which says
                            that we as a nation have certain core
commitments and beliefs
                            and one of them is that we are going to be sure
that there is
                            protection and some commitment to poor children
in America.   I   I


                            Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, did not vote.

                            The House Education Committee's ranking
Democrat, Rep.
                            William Clay of Missouri, said it opened
, 'unprecedented
                            loopholes for states and school districts to
avoid their
                            obligations to serve poor school children
first."

                            But Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., pointed to the
school shooting
                            outside Denver as indicative of the "tremendous
social
                            problems"   that schools face and the need to

           give them the
                                       flexibility to deal with them. "We in
           Washington shouldn't tell
                                       them how to do it.' ,



                                       The bill is H.R. 800.
