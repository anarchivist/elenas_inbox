TEXT:
Some of the women's groups called and asked if they could come in and have
a brainstorming session with us on how to go forward on family planning
issues in a more strateg~c fashion.  They have done some thinking and want
to discuss it with us.

One specific thing they have raised and I thought that Chris might want to
think about is they are suggesting increases to title 10 funding to make
abortion less necessary.

Jen would you please make sure Melanne knows.      (I couldn't get her on
email. )

Thanks.
