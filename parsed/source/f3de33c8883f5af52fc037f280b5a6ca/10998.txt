Subject:         Atlanta Trip/National Gun Show

While we are in Atlanta on Friday evening, a National Gun Show will be
occuring at the same time.  I think it runs through the weekend.
Apparently it has quite a large audience from around the country.  I had
heard that the radio address message is regarding this very subject, so I
wanted to let you all know. Thanks.
