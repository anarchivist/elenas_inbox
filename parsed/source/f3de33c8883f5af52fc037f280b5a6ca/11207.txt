                          POWELL v. RIDGE --- TALKING POINTS

      --The Government's brief in this case takes the position that the complain
t filed by the City of Philadelphia and other plaintiffs states a claim under T
it Ie VI regulations that should be considered by the courts, and not dismissed
on its face.

        --The Department of Education's Title VI regulations prohibit recipients   0
f
federal funds, including states, from using criteria or methods of
administration that have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination

based on race.

        --The City's complaint alleges that the state has administered its formula

for state aid to elementary and secondary education in a manner that has
resulted in discrimination based on race, both through factors in the state
formula itself and considering the state system for funding education, taken as
 a whole. The complaint also asserts that the state was able to foresee that ch
anges in its formula would decrease aid to school districts serving predominant
ly minority students. It thus raises an issue of intentional discrimination, as
 well as issues of disparate impact based on race.

      --The Department believes these issues warrant consideration by the
trial court.   The plaintiffs should have an 'opportunity to develop their theori
es and the facts and the defendants should have an opportunity to challenge the
m and to justify any disparities that are established, consistent with well-est
ablished civil rights principles found in Title VI and its implementing regulat
ions.
