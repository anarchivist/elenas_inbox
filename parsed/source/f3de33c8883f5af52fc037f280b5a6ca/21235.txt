TEXT:
Here are the ideas


1.   Food Safety. The President could announce some combination of the
following: a preliminary USDA study showing that salmonella risks have
declined by almost 50% in chicken and almost 40% in swine in part due to
HACCP program. However, we should do this event on the message openings
on the 24th or 25th or as the radio address on the 26th. This event shows
that the President's food safety initiative is working and that we should
get our food safety budget fully funded.  In addition, USDA has approximate
ly $1 to $2 million dollars worth of grants for projects such as Safe Food
for Mom and Tots and Distance Learning for food safety.   (I will send a
separate paragraph of what an event for next week would look like).

2.      A show and tell event demonstrating the importance of research
   federal research has led to technologies that dramatically reduce
salmonella in chicken and e-coli in cows.

3.      Kaiser Study on Violence. The Foundation says it could break
out a separate study on incidence of violence on shows where it is not
expected.

4.      Binge drinking. The Distillers have offered to do an event with
representatives of some of the several hundred universities using their
new alcohol education material. We would need to clarify MADD's
position.   In addition, the distillers have a policy of not placing
billboards near schools. They offered to work to find existing billboards
that might be torn down. This would be part of an effort to discourage
children from drinking.

5.      Rural.  It is likely there will be a substantial emergency
spending bill to sign for devastated farmers.

6.   Family Report.   If it can be fixed.

7. Homeless Veterans.   On September 28-30, the VA is having a conference
in Baltimore on homeless veterans. The President could attend and
announce the VA's grants for homeless veterans. Alternatively, the VA
could hold the announcement of the grants and we could announce it in


October. There might be some HUD grants he could announce as well.     In
addition, the VA did its FY1997 survey of homeless veterans that shows
that almost 25% of the veterans they serve could be considered homeless.
VA thinks that this report has not been announced yet (I still have to get
final confirmation on that)

8. Other. we should hear about the HHS heart attack/defibrillator
study. FCC said they will have some deliverables on e-rate that we should
look into.
