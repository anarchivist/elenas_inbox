                                                                              and strategy.


                 Background
                 There are two ways to increase substance abuse treatment:

                 1) Substance Abuse Block Grant"
                 These funds are allocated to states on a fonnula basis with states deciding how to target the funds.
                 SAMHSA requested an increase of $270 million for FY 2000. OMB passback holds them to FY 99 level
                 of $1.585 billion (plus an additional $100 million in advance funding).

                 2)Targeted Capacity Expansion Grants
                 These funds are designed to address treatment needs for emerging substance abuse problems specific to a
                 city, county, state or region, with a particular focus on meeting local needs since the block grant goes to
                 states. For FY 1988, SAMHSA identified several target groups including: substance abusing women
                 and their children, clients participating in welfare refonn programs, juvenile and adult criminal
                 justice-referred offenders, dually diagnose youth offenders, substance abusing physically and cognitively
                 challenged individuals, and hard-to-reach IV drug users. FY 98 funds supported 41 grants totaling $24
                 million to a combination of state, local, and tribal agencies and community-based organizations. This
                 funding will serve an additional _ people on an annual basis. Grants are available for three years, with.
                 first year funding generally between $500,000 and $700,000. Approximately one-third of the FY 1998
                 grants are targeted to TANF or substance abusing women with children. For example, Women in Need in
                 Brooklyn received $250,000 to expand capacity to serve an additional 85 homeless women and women
                 with children receiving TANi'. The Wisconsin Department of Health and Family services received
                 $750,000 to provide intensive family treatment to 121 women with children and TANF recipients.

                 US Conference of Mayors has indicated strong support for these grants -- in fact, they would like to see an
                 increase of around $250 million. Based on conversations with ONDPC staff, they generally support
                 SAMHSA's request both for the block grant and targeted capacity grants, but they particularly like the
                 targeted capacity grants since we have more ability to target and track how these get spent.
