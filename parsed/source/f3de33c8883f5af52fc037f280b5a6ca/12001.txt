TEXT:
Q:  The Wall Street Journal reports that the Medicare Trustees' Report
will show the Medicare Trust Fund is in much better shape than previously
forecast.  How does the White House know this, why is the Trust Fund in
better shape, and how does that affect the Medicare debate?

A:  The White House has received no information about the contents of the
Medicare Trustees' report.  We will receive it the same date everyone else
does -- next Tuesday (March 30th).  Having said this, because we believe
the Medicare outgoing payments and income revenue trends will likely
reflect recent projections by the Congressional Budget Office, we expect
the projected Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund exhaustion date to be
extended.  The stronger economy is clearly playing an important role in imp
roving virtually every economic forecast. But, once again, we will not
know until the Trustees report the current financial status of the program.

FOLLOW UP: How does any good news coming from this report affect the
Medicare debate?

A:   Under any scenario, the program will face dramatic demographic
challenges that will require significant new revenues.  Every independent
health expert has concluded that the retirement of the baby boom
generation will necessitate a major infusion of new resources to offset
this burden. As a result, the need for the President's dedication of 15
percent of the surplus (almost $700 billion over 15 years)  to the
Medicare program continues. And, as the President has made clear,
Medicare also requires reforms that modernize and strengthen the program.
