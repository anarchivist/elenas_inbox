TEXT:
Jim O'Hara called with an idea for a small tobacco annoucement for
tomorrow -- we could issue a paper statement from us or from HHS saying
"Today the Administation announced it will make available to all 50 states
new anti-teen smokings ads being released today in Massachusetts.""

Here's what this means. Massachusetts is unveiling three t.v. ads tomorrow
and is offering to make them available to the CDC, who will make them
available to other states. Normally, states that use other state's ads
must pay a "talent" fee.  In this case, CDC would offer to pay the fee.

The ads are hard-hitting ads based on the tobacco documents.  While
visually they focus on teens, they all repeat a mantra "It's Time We Made
Smoking History" which could leave us open to the charge that we want to
ban all tobacco.

Ad #1: Shows a 15 year old girl smoking with the words "The 14- to 18-year
old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population.  RJR must
soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position is to
be maintained in the long term" citing a 1976 RJR document.

Then it closes with the phrase:   "They Knew.   They Always Knew.   It's Time
We Made Smoking History."

Ad #2: Shows an 11 year old girl smoking with the words "Happily for the
tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety
of physiological actions" citing a 1972 RJR memo.

Then it cioses with the phrase:   "They Knew.   They Always Knew.   It's Time
We Made Smoking History."

Ad $3: Shows a 14 year old walking down the street with copy "If a young
person's desire to be daring is part of the inclination to start smoking,
the warning label on the package may be a plus" citing a 1973 RJR memo.

Then it closes with the phrase: "They Knew.     They Always Knew.   It's Time
We Made Smoking History."
