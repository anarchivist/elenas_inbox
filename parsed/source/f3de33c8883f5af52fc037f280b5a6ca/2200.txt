       TEXT:
       The House vote is scheduled for tomorrow after it comes back into session
       at 2. The Senate will probably wrap things up later in the afternoon, but
       as of this weekend no time agreement had been reached.  We should know
       more about this in the morning.

       One of the main potential obstacles had been an amendment that Sen. Boxer
       was threatening to drop on the issue of serving disabled kids in prisons.
       My impression is that she has backed off, but wants a colloquy on the
       issue.

       I have made a couple of changes in the draft press statement (attached) to
       reflect final passage, so it will be ready to go when the bill is.

 How about we do this after both Houses pass?   Or should we do after first
 house passes? what's the likely timetable?

    STATEMENT ON HOUSE AND SENATE PASSAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH
    DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION --
    DRAFT -- May 12, 1997

    I am pleased that the House and Senate today took a major step toward ensuring high
    quality educational opportunities for all students by voting to reauthorize the IDEA. Over
    the last 20 years, the IDEA has made it possible for young people with disabilities to reach their
    full potential, and this legislation strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to these children and
    their parents. This legislation is the result of a remarkable process involving hard work by
    congressional Democrats and Republicans, the Department of Education, and representatives of
    the education and disability communities. I look forward to signing this legislation into law,
    and I hope that we can continue in this bipartisan spirit and move forward on the rest of our
    agenda to improve education and prepare America for the 21st Century.




                                                                     Automate~ Records Managef!1ent System
