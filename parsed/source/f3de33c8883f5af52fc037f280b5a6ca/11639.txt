                                     Statement of the President
                                          March 10, 1999


Today, the Senate and the House have the chance to move forward with bipartisan legislation to
reduce class size and improve public schools across the country.          Last year, with bipartisan
support, Congress enacted a down payment on my initiative to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce
class size in the early grades. This week, the Republican leadership in the Senate not only is
blocking a vote on the Murray-Kennedy amendment to finish the job, but is trying to undermine
the bipartisan agreement we reach~d last fall. The Republicans are attempting to take the funds
we agreed to invest in reducing class size and divert those funds to special education. While we
should increase funding for special education -- as we have done in past years and as my budget
recommends continuing to do in the future -- I will vigorously oppose taking this money from
the recently enacted class size initiative. We should not be pitting our children against one
another or changing the rules now on our critical efforts to reduce class size. Smaller classes
will help all students do better, and will reduce the need for special education services by helping
teachers identify and assist as early as possible children who are having learning problems. I call
on every member of Congress to reject these Republican efforts, and allow an up-or down vote
this afternoon on the Murray-Kennedy and Clay-Wu measures to help reduce class size and hire
well-prepared teachers across the nation.
