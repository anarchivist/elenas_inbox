TEXT:
2.       TANF Participation Events: Could announce TANF participation rates,
along with latest caseload numbers, at a site visit that highlights
welfare reform working well. Note that we don't know exactly when the
participation rates will be ready (probably no earlier than later part of
October) and the news may be mixed (a number of states may fail two-parent
rates).   After the new Census Bureau's Current Population Survey data
becomes available 9/24, we will also be able to update the number of
people who were on welfare in one year who were working in the following
year (this number increased by nearly 30 percent between 1996 and 1997 --
as a result, 1.7 million adults on welfare in 1996 were working in March
1997.   At the end of the month, we'll have March 1998 data).

3.      Denver Event: The Partnership also has a low-profile event planned in
Denver for 10/28 which we could probably build on. POTUS will be in
Denver 10/20.

4.      Access to Jobs:  DOT plans to announce grant availability of Access to
Jobs funds 10/7 -- this is a pretty small thing but we might be able to .
package with something else.

5.      WTW Competitive Grants: The WTW Competitive Grants we mentioned
earlier will now not be ready until mid-November.
