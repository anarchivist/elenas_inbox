TEXT:
At Elena's request, I talked to Ann Lewis about education paper for the
Democratic Unity event. Sounds like we haven't actually achieved unity
just yet.

Ann's understanding is that Gephardt's office volunteered to put the
education paper together for this, and that we will see what they produce
on Monday. In the meantime, I've sent Ann the piece that I did last week,
so she has some idea of what our version of unity looks like.

I'm quite confident this will all come together sometime late Wednesday
night.
