TEXT:
The Washington Post has agreed to run a commentary by cecilia Munoz on the
problem of her being asked whether she is a U.S. citizen while others
were not asked in order to get into the White House for the welfare
briefing. The commentary will note that worksite verification (basically
all employers in five of top seven states with immigrants -- CA, TX, FLA,
N.Y. etc.) and benefit verification (nationwide application) is required
now by law.   The policy point that Cecilia will make is that if the White
House can't get it right and avoid nondiscriminatory application in its
"verification" procedures, then why should anyone think that private
employers and federal, state and local agencies can implement these laws
without discrimination.  She may cite past GAO studies that indicate that
worksite verification does contribute to the risk of employers
discriminating against citizens and other legal workers who "look or sound
foreign" or who have "foreign-sounding" names.

In regard to the Administration's effort's in this area:   The verification
systems are being designed right now.    The DPC has been playing a central
role in assisting the agencies to try to design these systems in a way
that will minimize discrimination and we head an interagency
antidiscrimination working group to address the policy and operational
issues that arise in this context.    Let me know if you need more
information.

thanks
