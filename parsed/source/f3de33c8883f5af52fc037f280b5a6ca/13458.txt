 TALKING POINTS FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY EVENT
 MARCH 26, 1996

 ?       Thank you for coming to the White House today. We're in a
 tough fight against some bad legislation, and you all are on
 the front lines of that fight.
 ?       The bill we're fighting is H.R. 956, the so
 o
 -called Common
 Sense Product Liability Legal Reform Act of 1996. John
 Hilley will discuss with you the legislative status of this
 bill. What I'd like to talk to you about is why the
 President opposes it, why he will veto it, and why we have
 to fight to sustain that veto.
 ?       H.R. 956 would encourage wrongful conduct, and it would
 prevent injured persons from recovering the full measure of
 their damages. That's wrong.
 ?       That's why we object to the complete elimination of
 joint
 o
 -and
 o
 -several liability for non
 o
 -economic damages. We
 believe this would prevent many victims from obtaining the
 damages to which they are entitled.
 ?       That's why we object to a stringent cap on punitive damages.
 We believe that would increase the incentive of
 manufacturers to knowingly produce and sell defective
 products.
 ?       And with regard to states' rights, here we have perhaps the
 greatest irony of all coming out of this Congress. All they
 talk about is giving power back to the States.  I hear Bob


Dole thinks it's so important to talk about States' rights
that he pulls out a copy of the Tenth Amendment to the
constitution at every campaign speech.
?       Well, here's what they really think of States' rights.
Under their product liability bill, States can go beyond
this new Federal law -- as long as they are taking steps to
make the law even more pro
o
-business. But if they try to
pass State laws that are more pro
o
-consumer, forget it. This
bill says, no way.
?       So State's rights are ok if you want to screw consumers.
But if you want to protect them, don't even think about it.
?       Let me be clear.  The President is not opposed to sensible,
limited product liability reform. But this legislation
doesn't meet that standard.

?        Now, I don't have to tell you how hard the Republicans and
major business organizations have been working this
legislation. They're depicting the President's stand as a
giveaway to lawyers.
?        Well, you're the people who can stand up and tell the
American people what this is really about.   It's not about
lawyers; it's about the rights of consumers.
?        It's about the victims of shootings and the victims of drunk
drivers.
?        It's about the victims of products that use biomaterials
when the suppliers have been negligent, like the Dow Corning
breast implant case.
?        For those of you whose organizations have been working
against this legislation, keep up the good work.   For those
that have not, please get involved.   Speak out. Get your
constituencies to speak out. Alexis Herman is here to talk
about how you can help.
?        The President is taking a tough stand here, and he's taking
a lot of partisan criticism for it.   I think he deserves
your support. I know he appreciates it.
?        Thank you.
