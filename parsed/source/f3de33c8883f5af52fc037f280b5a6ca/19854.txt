TEXT:
We are still in a logjam between OMB and HHS over whether we made a
commitment to Sandy Levin to "revisit" the issue of taking $40 million
from the TANF contingency fund to pay for the adoption bill.  (See my
fuller explanation below.)  Nicole has advised me that HHS is probably
right, but she wasn't in the final negotiations.  I am siding with HHS at
the moment and the dispute is holding up the release of the contingency
fund report, which is now a month late.  So please let me know if you have
any light to shed on this.

Subject:         Raiding the contingency fund for the adoption bill

A point of contention has arisen between HHS and OMB over the
circumstances under which we agreed to fund part of the adoption bill by
cutting the contingency fund by $40 million. Mary Bourdette says that
Levin was very unhappy about ,this funding source, and she is adamant that
we told him at the time that we would "revisit" the issue in the future to
see whether there was some better source of $40 million. OMB denies there
was any such commitment to Levin, or at least keeps repeating that they
don't have a $40 million alternative. Mary counters that we didn't
guarantee anyone a substitute $40 million, but we did agree to reexamine
the issue. She said Josh was definitely aware of this.

 (The practical effect of this dispute is whether to include a sentence in
an HHS report on the contingency fund saying that "one alternative is to
look for another source of the $40 million.   Mary says Levin will be very
chagrined if the report doesn't say this.)

I wasn't around for this ,debate, so I'm not taking a side at the moment.
Let me know if any of you have a position on this.
