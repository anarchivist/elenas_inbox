  Crime Colleagues:

  Some pre-crime meeting issues:

  1. Brady -- The NRA's attorney sent a letter to the AG and President
  listing the 19 state statutes that either expressly prohibit or do not all
  for background checks in the 23 Brady states. DOJ is checking this out
  now, and I've red dotted copies to all of you.

  2. COPS amendment -- I spoke to Chris Putala in Biden's office about a
  proposed Leahy amendment that will significantly undermine our 100,000
  cops goal. The amendment would allow unobligated COPS funds to be used to
  renew hiring grants for smaller jurisdictions (under 150,000). While
  Biden and the COPS office is working with Leahy on the amendment, they
  both think we need to have a senior WH person -- maybe Podesta -- call and
  fight for the integrity of the President's single biggest crime program
  and priority. We can commit and try to work with him to address whatever
  problems jurisdictions in his state face (we still have limited waiver
  authority), but we need 0 keep him from amending and fundamentally
  shifting how the COPS money gets distributed.

  3. Gun-Free Schools -- With respect to the Grassley amendment to extend
  the GFSA to expand the mandatory one-year expulsion policy for guns to
  drugs, alcohol and tobacco, Biden's folks aren't too worried. While they
  expect it to win, they predict their will be significant backlash before
  it is taken up on the floor, and that it will ultimately be narrowed.

  4. ATF Gun Tracing Initiative.   I am meeting with Michael Deich -- sans
  Treasury -- at the end of the day today to go over funding options to
  expand the initiative, and we all may need to meet with Mike Froman and


 Treasury by Friday, too.  The report on the first 17 cities has gone to
 print and should be ready by Wednesday next· week. I'll have a draft of
 the AG's/Rubin's cover memo by Friday at the latest.

 sorry so long,
 Jose'
