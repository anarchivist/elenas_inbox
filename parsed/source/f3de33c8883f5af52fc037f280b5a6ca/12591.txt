TEXT:
The current language in Title XI of ESEA (Accountability) -- would no
longer require that schools devlop a "plan" for how to address the
education needs of suspended and expelled students but would instead
specify that the discipline policy must provide for "appropriate
supervision, counseling, and education services that will help those
students continue to meet the State's challenging standards."

Are you ok with this language?   OMB would like to close out the
discipline/expulsion issue.

Note, if we keep this language -- schools that expel gun-toting students
under the Gun-Free Schools Act would have to meet these same
requirements of providing appropriate supervision, counseling and
education services.
