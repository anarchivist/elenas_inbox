     TEXT:
     OMB is working with USDA to generate a planning response to the recent
     Hudson Foods meat recall.  Within the next two days we expect to have
     draft legislation circulated to you for comments through OMB's standard
     LRD process.

     At this point, Secretary Glickman favors a simple request for increased
     authority for dealing with tainted food crises, including recalls and
     levying of civil penalties.  Other suggestions for a comprehensive
     Administration plan include a broader pathogen reduction approach, such as
     the Administration proposed in 1994, and increased authorities for FDA as
     well as USDA.  If you have thoughts about the strategy or coordination of
     the Administration's response to the food safety issues raised by the
     recent events, please feel free to discuss them with TJ Glauthier at OMB
     (x54561). Comments on the legislation proper should be directed to LRD.

     Please let me know of any others who should included in these reviews.
