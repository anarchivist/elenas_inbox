    WASHINGTON (AP)    Liggett & Myers Inc., smallest of the big five
cigarette-makers, agreed today to cooperate with the Justice
Department's criminal investigation of the tobacco industry.
    The agreement, the first of its kind with a major tobacco
company, did not contain any grant of immunity from prosecution,
the department announced. Liggett had sought immunity in
discussions with prosecutors, officials had said.
    The Durham, N.C., company and its parent, Liggett Group Inc. of
New York, agreed to provide complete and accurate information
about:
     Industry knowledge of the health consequences of smoking
cigarettes and the addictive nature of nicotine.
     Targeting of children and adolescents as customers.
     Manipulation of nicotine levels in tobacco products.
