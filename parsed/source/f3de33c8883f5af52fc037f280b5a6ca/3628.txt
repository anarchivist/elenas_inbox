MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               CYNTHIA RICE

SUBJECT:       NEXT WEEK'S SPEECH ON STATE WELFARE REFORM EFFORTS

        On Monday, July 28th, you will speak to the National Governors' Association in Las
Vegas. We believe your speech is an opportunity to make a major statement on welfare reform
one year after you signed the new law into effect and four years after you began to reform welfare
by granting waivers to the states. You are scheduled to follow this speech with a Welfare to
Work Partnership event on August 12th with several hundred business leaders in St. Louis who
will accept your challenge to hire welfare recipients.

        We thought that in the NGA speech you could provide a statement ofthe principles and
values that have guided welfare reform. You could discuss the importance of work and
responsibility, of requiring both parents to support their children, and also of teaching teenagers
that staying in school and avoiding parenthood are the right things to do. You could talk about
the new role of welfare workers: not to dole out checks, but to assist welfare recipients in
meeting the challenge of joining the workforce. And you could talk about the need to support
work -- to make sure it pays better than welfare -- through the minimum wage, EITC, child
support, and investments in health care, child care, and transportation.

        We also thought that in the NGA speech you could turn the spotlight on the states: to
underscore the successes -- but also point out some of the shortcomings -- of state welfare reform
efforts. You could emphasize that while we have much to be proud of, we cannot rest on our
laurels. Instead, states must seize the opportunity to use savings from declining caseloads and
the growing economy to put even more people to work. Many states are investing new funds in
child care, transportation, and other welfare-to-work efforts; others are diverting savings to other
parts of their budgets. We thought you could praise those who are doing the right thing, and
scold, though not by name, those who are not. Overall, we hope in this speech that you could
send a signal that we intend to hold states accountable for their actions.

        Finally, you could include an update on education standards in the speech, probably
referring to the announcements you will have made on Friday of the big city school districts that
have agreed to adopt the new tests.
The State of the States
                                                                              Hex-Dump ConversIon

        As you know, welfare refonn began long before last August, with the waivers we granted
to 43 states to allow them to impose tough work requirements and time limits and provide
incentives to make work pay better than welfare. Under the new law, nearly 90 percent ofthese
states have chosen to continue or build upon their waivers. Many of these states have intensified
their efforts, either expanding small demonstration projects state-wide or leveraging additional
financial or community resources for welfare to work efforts. Other states are simply in a
holding pattern, postponing changes because of political conflict (i.e., New York and California)
or for other reasons. Here's a summary of some of the interesting trends we've uncovered.

        Child Care: Efforts to expand child care are widespread. Because of the additional $4
billion we secured in the welfare law, all states are receiving more federal funds, which they must
match with their own dollars. About half the states are increasing their spending beyond what is
needed to match the new federal funds. Some states are adding quite a bit more: Wisconsin is
adding $160 million, Illinois is adding $100 million, and Florida is adding $23 million in new
funds and shifting $60 million from the welfare block grant to child care. A new paper by the
Progressive Policy Institute praises Illinois, Michigan, and Washington for establishing
"seamless" child care systems which provide subsidies for all workers below a certain income,
whether they've been on welfare or not. (There's a growing concem that some states are
short-changing the working poor by giving fonner welfare recipients priority for child care
subsidies. Creating a universal, income-based system avoids that problem.)

        Transportation: Several states have developed strategies to ensure welfare recipients have
the transportation they need to get to work. Kentucky is now implementing an initiative to
ensure that transportation is available in all areas of the state. Connecticut is earmarking $2.2
million of its TANF funds for new transportation services for welfare recipients. New Jersey
has announced a $3.7 million initiative to move Work First New Jersey participants to work. In
May, the Department of Transportation worked with NGA to award planning grants to help 24
states develop transportation strategies to support their welfare to work efforts.

        Welfare to Work Programs: Nearly all state welfare-to-work programs include the
traditional elements: job search, training, education, community work experience, and placement
in unsubsidized jobs. But now, according to a new survey by NGA, 36 states are using welfare
checks to subsidize private jobs, although mostly on a small scale. Twenty-seven states have
"upfront diversion" progranis which provide job search assistance or emergency cash grants to
help prevent people from going on welfare. Several states (Maryland, Pennsylvania, Florida)
provide tax incentives to companies that hire welfare recipients. In many states, the governor
and other elected officials are reaching out to the business community to forge new partnerships.
In Nevada, the state has set a goal for new casinos to set aside 10 percent of all positions for
fonner welfare recipients.

                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion


             Diverting Welfare Savings for Other Uses: Not all states are investing welfare savings in
     child care, transportation, or other welfare to work efforts. According to the Progressive Policy
     Institute, Ohio is actually cutting state spending on child care and is using some of its savings
     from lower welfare caseloads for tax cuts (the state protests that, with the infusion of federal
     dollars, it is still spending more overall on child care than before). In Connecticut, the governor
     proposed and the legislature enacted a plan which uses federal T ANF dollars to replace existing
     state social services spending. In Texas, the state spent less than one-third of its surplus from
     declining caseloads on welfare to work programs; the rest was used on state programs previously
     funded by state dollars.

             Child Support Enforcement: As you know, we have made progress in child support
     enforcement, increasing collections by 50% from 1992 to 1996. Last year's welfare law
     included tough new measures to help states track deadbeat parents across states lines. To date,
     however, many states have not enacted all the state laws needed to put these tough new measures
     into place. According to HHS, one state -- Idaho -- has not enacted any of the new child support
     provisions required by the new federal law. Moreover, nine states -- including California, which
     has 22% of the nation's welfare caseload -- wi11likely not make this October's deadline to put in
     place new child support computer systems. We think that in your speech you should underscore
     the need for prompt state action in these areas.
