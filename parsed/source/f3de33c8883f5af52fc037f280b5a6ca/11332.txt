TEXT:
Tomorrow the AFL-CIO is releasing a report that says that America's
working families lose $200 billion of income annually because of the wage
gap and that on average each family loses $4000 each year, even after
accounting for differences in education, age, location, and the number of
hours worked.   I will send you a copy of the report.

The First Lady had been interested in numbers like these for a possible
event, and we have CEA working on trying to come up with how much a family
loses because of the wage gap, and how much a women entering the workforce
today would lose over her lifetime.
