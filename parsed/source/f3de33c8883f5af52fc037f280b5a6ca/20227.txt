                                National Ocean Conference

                                     Message Overview

President Clinton and Vice President Gore continue to make the environment a top
priority for this Administration. Their work on tough new air quality standards and
enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act assures families a healthier and safer
environment in which to live. By preserving and restoring precious natural resources like
the Florida's Everglades, Yellowstone Park and California's ancient redwoods, they are
working to safeguard these treasures for future generations. The United States is leading
international efforts to address global warming. And in 1998, the International Year of the
Ocean, the President and Vice President are devoting special attention to protecting the
oceans.

Oceans sustain nearly half of all life on Earth and prov~de us with many vital resources.
They are a source of food, energy, commerce, medicine, and recreation. They shape our
weather, link us to other nations, and are critical to our national security. In the 21st
century, we will look increasingly to the oceans to meet our everyday needs.

At the National Ocean Conference, government experts,business executives, scientists,
environmentalists, elected officials, and the public will come together to examine the
opportunities and challenges we face as we work to restore and preserve our irreplaceable
ocean resources, from the following four perspectives:

          Environment - Only through careful stewardship can we maintain the health
          of our oceans and the economic opportunities they provide, such as fishing
          and tourism. With many marine resources already over-stressed, we must
          increase efforts to prevent over fishing, coastal pollution, and other threats to
          our beaches and the ocean environment.

          Commerce - Oceans help sustain 1 of every 6 jobs in the United States
          through fishing, shipping, tourism, research, etc. With growing
          international trade and rising demand for ocean resources, our ports, coasts
          and ocean waters become ever more vital to our economic future.

          Exploration and Research - We must expand scientific efforts to catalog
          marine species and other ocean resources, identify promising new medicines
          and other materials, understand how the oceans regulate our climate, and
          gain the insights needed to restore and sustain marine ecosystems.

          Global Security - Freedom of the seas is vital to national security and
          international trade, and the presence of our naval forces around the world
          promotes peace and stability. We must work with other nations to ensure
                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

that our oceans remain free and open.
