Q: Senator Breaux is circulating estimates by your own Medicare actuary
which affirms that his premium support options saves $372 billion over 10
years? Do you agree with the estimate and how do you respond to it?

A: Any credible package of reforms will strengthen the Medicare program
and extend the life of the Trust Fund. The savings the actuary projects
appears to come from a variety of sources.   The premium support has been
redesigned to save between $75 and $100 billion over 10 years.   While this
represents less than one-third of the savings in the package Senator
Breaux circulated and would not significantly extend the life of the
Trust Fund, it certainly is noteworthy that this version of premium suppot
appears to achieve much needed savings for the program. The challenge of
the Commission, however, is to review the positive and potential negative
implications of this particular premium support model, as well as the rest
of the proposal, to determine how it impacts on the program, the
beneficiaries it serves, and the hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and
nurses who provide health care services to some of our most vulnerable
citizens. We look forward to learning about the Commission's
deliberations today on the most recent proposal put forth by Senator
Breaux.
