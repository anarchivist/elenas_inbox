  TEXT:
  On Monday, June 23, you will announce the issuance of HUD's report, "The
  State of American Cities." The report, in three sections, describes:

             1.    The "decades of decline" leading up to the early 1990's.

  2A. The significant improvements made by cities since 1993 as a result of
  the strong economy and this Administrations's urban policies (including
  Empowerment Zones, CDFI, homeownership strategies, and) along with

  2B. The real challenges that remain, specifically: job growth disparity
  between cities and suburbs, increased poverty concentration in central
  cities, and continued middle-class migration frmo central cities to the
  suburbs.

  3. The Administration's "Urban Agenda for the Future," a comprehensive
  plan based on the same empowerment principles (local control, flexibility)
  that undergird everything we have done so far.

  Building on the report, you will announce three new policies to help
  America's cities:

  1. The Officer Next Door program makes government owned homes available
  for sale at a fifty percent discount to police officers who agree to live
  in the communities they police.

  2. You will announce an additional 25 basis points reduction in mortgage
  insurance premiums for first time buyers who purchase homes in central
  cities.

  3. You will call for legislation transforming Section 8 certificates and
  vouchers into potential homeownership vouchers, enabling low-income
  families to use their Section 8 subsidies to support debt service on a
  mortgage.

  You will also reiterate your call for a new round of Empowerment Zones and
  brownfields cleanup incentives, contrasting the inclusion of Empowerment


 Zones and brownfields funding in the budget deal, with the lack of such
 funding in Republican tax proposals.

 Finally, you will announce HUD's top-to-bottom management reform plan,
 developed at your direction to incoming-Secretary Cuomo in January.
