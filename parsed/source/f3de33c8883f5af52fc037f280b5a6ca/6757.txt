TEXT:
Elena,
Attached is a revised draft of the POTUS statement re: H1B.  It may still
be a little long, but could be shortened more by eliminating the detail on
training and reforms.  Peter tells me that Kennedy is making his statement
on Wed., so I a~sume that is our target date for getting this done.   Ceci
is also sharing this draft with Sally. 'Thanks.

Julie

      The President supports efforts in the Congress to develop a comprehensive legislative package to
      address the increasing demand for skilled workers in industries where there has been substantial
      job growth -- including the information technology (IT) industry. In the short term, we may need
      to temporarily increase the number of temporary visas for foreign workers. However, this effort
      must be combined with both a reform of the HIB visa program and a concerted effort--
      including commitments from both government and industry -- to find, place, educate and train
      U.S. workers for these high-growth and high-wage jobs.

      Investing in training and education is the critical strategy to sustain our economic growth and
      make sure that all of our people benefit from this growth. Key components of this strategy are
      our HOPE Scholarships, the Lifetime Learning Tuition Credit, the expansion ofPell Grants, and
      the extension and expansion of Section 127 (that excludes employer-paid tuition assistance from
      income). This is also why it is critical that Congress pass the GJ. Bill for America's Workers
      this Spring.

                                                          .
      The other essential component to ensuring an adequate supply of skilled workers to meet industry
                                .
      needs is reform of the current HI B visa program. Since 1993, this Administration has sought
      reforms of the HIB program, such as requiring employers to "recruit and retain" U.S. workers
      before hiring temporary foreign workers, prohibiting lay-offs of U.S. workers to replace them
      with foreign temporary workers, and reducing the maximum stay for HIB workers from 6 to 3
      years. These reforms, if enacted, would help to target HIB usage to industries and employers
      that are exhibiting genuine labor shortages.

      The nation's immigration system is not the solution for widespread U.S. skill shortages. We
      need to redouble our efforts -- through education and training for both new workers and those
      who wish to upgrade their skills -- to ensure that U.S. workers are prepared to meet the demands
      of our rapidly changing economy.
