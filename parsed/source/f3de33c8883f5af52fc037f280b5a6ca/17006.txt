TEXT:
The conference committee acted on FDA's appropriation yesterday. While
they kept the $34 million for tobacco, they cut FDA's overall budget by an
unexpected $16 million.  In effect, they funded tobacco in part by cutting
drug reviews and other core FDA activities.  Is there anything we can do
at this point?
