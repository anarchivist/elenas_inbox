TEXT:
I don't know yet.  I've been told that AG will send Yvette Jackson or
Bonny O'Neil; our office said that Marvin Krislov or Seth Harris would be
best from DOL, so I've left a message w/ Marvin's office.  I'm still
waiting to hear back from HHS as well.

If you have any suggestions, please offer. Otherwise, I will be sure to
leave you an email w/ the confirmed list later today. Ken also asked that
I call Kitty Higgins and invite her.  If she can't make it, they will send
someone.
