             Comparison ofNGA Draft Proposal on Legal Immigrants and Refugees
                               with Administration Policy

Summary: NGNs priorities are very close to those in the President's budget. NGA would
exempt many disabled and elderly immigrant who have not naturalized from the SSI and Food
Stamps bans. The President's budget provides SSI and Medicaid to disabled, including elderly
disabled immigrants. Both the NGA and the President's budget expand protections for
refugees.
