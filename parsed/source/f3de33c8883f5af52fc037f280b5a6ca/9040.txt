TEXT:
Ridge Schulyer from Senator Robb's office called, and said that, given the
Fourth Circuit's decision, now might be the time to push for a bill to
regain some FDA authority. He said they would be willing to push for a
bill that takes the payments to the states out of the equation but
includes teen smoking provisions, FDA authority, an upfront payment from
the companies in exchange for no punitives in lawsuits, public health
provlslons, provlsl0ns for farmers, and a price increase for cigarettes.
He is going to send an informal proposal next week -- I will pass it along.
