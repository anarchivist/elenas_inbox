TEXT:
I have all of the original documents on the full debate in about four file
folders.  The info I have dates back to before I started. Do you want the
files or should I archive them?

Also, to whom should I pass on my other women's issues files? I've got a
lot on domestic violence, title IX, all of the choice issues, and so on.

My last day will be next Monday or Tuesday, so I'm trying to clean house
now.
