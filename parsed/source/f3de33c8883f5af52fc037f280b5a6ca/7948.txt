TEXT:
They called Fred Duval to make sure we were standing by our agreement, and
he told them we are.   Two questions:

1) Governors want to know who to target for Hill calls. Any suggestions?
Shalala is going to call
Chafee, Collins, Dewine, Frist, Jeffords, and Snowe. Any Dems that they
should call?

2) They want to know if we have a priority for where the tax money would
come from -- i.e., will protect the $196.5 billion and allow cuts in
farmers, public health and research. Any thoughts?
