TEXT:
Thanks to Tom, we have the FTC testimony.  It lays out FTC's history of
tobacco legislation, noting that in the FTC shares jurisdiction with FDA
over regulation of food, over-the-counter drugs, medical devices, and
cosmetics.

It then calls for a reaffirmation of the FDA's authority while saying the
FTC is willing to do more, saying: "We believe the FDA's efforts have been
valuabler in promoting public health and that Congress should affirm FDA's
authority to regulation tobacco products as it would any other drug or
device.  We also believe that the FTC can make a significant contribution
to any post-settlement regulation of tobacco advertising."

The testimony goes on to say that:

        1) At a minimum, legislation should not alter the FTC's current
authority over unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the advertising
or marketing of tobacco products.

        2) Should Congress determine that FTC has a role to play in
administering the advertising provisions of the settlement, it would do so
"vigorously and competently."

The testimony then gives a strong statement against the anti-trust
provisions of the ~ettlement c_ after a detailed discussion, it concludes
"the Commission believes that the industry has not established a need for
any antitrust exemption in order to implement the proposed settlement."
