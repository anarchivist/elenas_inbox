HOUSE PASSES ANTI-GAY ADOPTION AMENDMENT TO
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL

Rep. Tiahrt Amendment Passes Denying D.C. Money For Needle Exchange
Programs

 WASHINGTON -- In the latest of series of legislative attacks against gay
Americans and people at risk for HIV, two amendments to the District of
Columbia House Appropriations Bill were passed that would prohibit
unmarried couples from jointly adopting and deny money for needle exchange
programs. The discriminatory adoption amendment, offered by Oklahoma
Republican Steve Largent, is unmistakably anti-gay and is an intrusion into
local government that will put thousands of DC children at risk, according
to the Human Rights Campaign.
       "The contradictions and illogic of Largent's anti-gay amendment are
unbelievable. On the one hand, those pushing it say they want to provide
greater security for children. But in reality, they are creating less


stability by limiting the number of guardians which will leave children
vulnerable," said HRC political director Winnie Stachelberg.    "The American
public doesn't want family policy made by the federal government.     It is
hypocritical that these vocal proponents of more local control want to play
national nanny and micro-manage adoption decisions that should be made on a
case-by-case basis by parents and professionals."
        Under the Largent amendment, which passed on a 227-192 vote,
single DC residents would still have the ability to adopt children.    The
amendment will ban joint adoption by unrelated persons.    While both
parties of an unmarried couple would obviously still serve as parents to
the child, the second parent would have no legal responsibility or
protections for the child, including financial. In unfortunate
circumstances, such as a break up or the death of a legal parent,    the
non-legal parent would have no legal responsibility to care for the child.
As of June 22, 1998, there were 3,600 children in the D.C. foster care
system waiting to be adopted.
        The passage of Rep. Largent's amendment follows last week's
rejection of the same amendment offered by Rep. Tiahrt to the House
Appropriations Committee.   For three years, there have been attempts to
attach similar language on adoption in the D.C. appropriations bill. This
is the first time such language has passed.
          An August, 1997 poll conducted by Penn, Schoen & Berland
Associates shows that most Americans agree that the federal government
should stay out of family law decisions.   In fact, Americans categorically
reject the notion that the government should take a greater role in
deciding who can and cannot adopt children. By a margin of nearly four to
one (74 to 19 percent,) voters say we should keep the system we currently
have, rather than allow the federal government to take a greater role.
        Kansas Republican Rep. Tiahrt's amendment to the bill also passed
by a vote of 250-169.   The Tiahrt amendment would prohibit the use of
federal and District funds from being used for needle exchange programs.
The amendment further prohibits funds from being paid to any organization
that carries out such programs.
         "This crass political opportunism and intrusion into local District
affairs will result in more people suffering and becoming infected with
HIV," said HRC senior health policy advocate Seth Kilbourn.
        The Tiahrt amendment is a radical departure from previous
Congressional action on this issue and sets a dangerous precedent for many
states and localities where needle exchange programs operate using local
and state funds.
          The District of Columbia has chosen to use its own funds to
address an urgent local need. Congress should not encroach on the ability
of any state or locality to implement successful programs to prevent the
transmission of HIV.
         "We will work tirelessly during the months ahead to defeat both of
these amendments in conference," said Stachelberg.
          The Human Rights Campaign is the largest national lesbian and gay
political organization, with members throughout the country. It effectively
lobbies Congress, provides campaign support, and educates the public to
ensure that lesbian and gay Americans can be open, honest, and safe at
home, at work, and in the community.
