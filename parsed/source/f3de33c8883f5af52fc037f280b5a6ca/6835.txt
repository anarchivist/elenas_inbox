                                     Question and Answer                       Hex-Dump Conversion
                                        March 26, 1998


    Q:   Mr. President, some experts have commented that the Jonesboro shooting -- as well
         as the Pearl and Paducah shootings -- were at least in part the result of Southern
         culture's close relationship with firearms, and that the time has come for the South
         -- and all of rural America -- to end its love affair with guns. Do you agree with
         this assessment?

    A:   I don't know that I agree with that assessment. As a Southerner, I grew up around
         firearms and went hunting. I know what it's like to grow up in a community where
         school lets out the first day of the deer hunting season. Done responsibly, there's
         nothing necessarily wrong with that.

         I think if we're going to make any sense at all about these terrible tragedies, we must
         view the problem -- and any potential solutions -- in much broader terms. Sadly, too
         many of our young people today are less likely to spend time with responsible adults than
         they are to witness hundreds of murders on television -- or to play video games that
         reward brutal violence. That shouldn't be. We should be showing these kids how to
         resolve their conflicts peacefully. We should be setting an example for them -- teaching
         them right from wrong. And we should be filling their lives with opportunities to do
         good and get ahead. I think that's what most important.

         But government has a role, too. That is why I have asked the Attorney General and
         Secretary Riley to reach out to some of the experts and ask them if there's more that we
         can do to prevent these types of tragedies. We have already done much to promote
         responsibility and reduce crime and violence in America. We have passed tough gun
         laws, hired more police, and enforced zero tolerance policies in our schools. But we are
         prepared to do whatever else is necessary to keep our children safe.
