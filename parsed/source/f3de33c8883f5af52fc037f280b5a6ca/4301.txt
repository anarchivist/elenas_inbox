TEXT:
At our meeting on Sunday, the following tasks were assigned or assumed:

Dawn and Rob: will arrange a meeting on benchmarks, which will include
Communications so that we can think about how to talk about it. Dawn will
circulate a memo describing Commerce's process/method for establishing the
benchmarks.

Chuck: after today's meeting on Prop 209, will get back to us and/or
arrange a meeting to discuss how to proceed on Prop 209.

Gene: will make contact with Sally Katzen and Janet Yellen to discuss
benchmarking (Sylvia spoke with them on Sunday)

Gene and Judy:    will work together on data collection.

Maria:     will put together an outreach plan to the groups.

As soon as we get some feedback on these items, we will arrange another
meeting to determine how to proceed.
