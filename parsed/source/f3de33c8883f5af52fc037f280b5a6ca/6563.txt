     Just saw this on schedule .. you probably know this but Joan Huffer
     mentioned today that Kerrey is all upset about a New Entitlement
     (class size) and the balanced budget.     Daschle is trying to explain
     to his staff that class size is a capped mandatory program and
     therefore cannot escalate out of control.    In fact it would have very
     set amounts for each of 7 years and that the funding path is necessary
     to ensure that teachers who are hired will be paid in the out years.
