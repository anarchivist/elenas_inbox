TEXT:
The OMB program examiner tried again with the House Committee
staff to get them to delete the requirement to report reasons for
removal of the Commissioner to Congress. The Committee staff were
not interested in dropping the provision - pointing that they had
already taken out the removal for cause language.
Please let me know if you want to pursue it further and I'll get
you the name and number of the Committee staffer.  They say that
they are planning to wrap up the language of the manager's
amendment tomorrow.
