TEXT:
You asked about two issues raised by members of the gay community.

1.   VAWA discrimination. The current law does not seem to discriminate,
it is actually more of a state problem.  For instance,  according to the
groups a gay partner might not have standing in some civil courts to
obtain a restraining order, and might have to go to criminal court. A
heterosexual couple would be able to use most civil courts and not have to
show a criminal assault had occurred.   The groups suggested urging
changes in state laws using federal pressure.

2. Serial killers.     According to the groups, states have been somewhat
scattered in reporting suspected serial killers to the FBI. There seems
to be no law requiring them to.   We are in contact with the DOJ to track
down what can be said and see if we can move something.
