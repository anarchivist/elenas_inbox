     DRAFT STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-DYIllp Conversion
     H.R. 1501 Consequences for Juvenile Offenders Act of 1999
     H.R. 2122 Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act of 1999

      The Administration supports a comprehensive approach to addressing the problem of youth
      crime and violence. The President has taken the lead to address youth violence on all fronts-
      from the media to the gun industry to parental responsibility. Most importantly, the
      Administration supports common sense gun legislation to help keep guns out of the hands of
      children and criminals. Specifically, the Administration supports measures to strengthen the
       successful Brady Law to require Brady background checks at gun shows and flea markets, and to
       raise the age of handgun ownership from 18 to 21. In addition, the Administration supports other
     . life-saving measures already passed by the Senate to: require mandatory child safety devices with
      every new handgun sold; ban the importation of large capacity ammunition clips; prohibit violent
      juveniles from buying guns as adults; and bar juvenile possession of assault rifles.

     H.R. 2122 not only fails to close the gun show loophole, but also creates new dangerous
     loopholes in our gun laws. The bill contains a narrower definition of "gun show" that would not
     cover flea markets and other such commercial venues where hundreds of guns are regularly
     bought and sold. In addition, the bill creates a safe harbor for criminals by creating a new class
     of "instant check registrants" to do background checks at gun shows - undermining law
     enforcement efforts to trace firearms that are later used in crimes. We believe that the
     McCarthylRoukema amendment is the only proposal under consideration that will close the gun
     show loophole once and for all.

     In addition, the Administration supports comprehensive legislation to strengthen youth
     responsibility and accountability by juvenile offenders. While the Administration recognizes the
     importance of addressing juvenile crime, it is only through a comprehensive approach to crime --
     including prevention, intervention, and punishment -- that we can continue to lower our crime
     rate, improve the safety of our communities, and deter children and adults from a life of crime.

     To this end, the Administration supports H.R. 1501. However, the Administration is
     disappointed that the legislation fails to include one of the most significant contributions to our
     nation's safer streets -- the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. The
     President proposed nearly $1.3 billion in his FY 2000 budget - and nearly $6.4 billion over the
     next five years - for a new 21 st Century Policing Initiative to help communities build on their
     efforts under the COPS program. This initiative will enable communities to continue to hire,
     redeploy, and retain police officers; to give law enforcement officers access to the latest crime-
     fighting technologies; to hire community prosecutors; and to foster community-wide prevention.
     These successful tools in the fight against crime must be an integral part of any legislation that
     seeks to make our streets safer, but they are not included in current House legislation.

     Finally, the Administration supports efforts to address the issue of media violence and its effects
     on our young people. That is why the President has taken the lead by challenging the
     entertainment industry to live up to its responsibilities, and recently called for a study of the
serious constitutional concerns have been raised about an amendment to ban the distribution of
violent materials to teenagers.

The Administration will work with the Congress throughout the legislative process to ensure
passage of legislation that will have a meaningful impact on curbing youth violence and
increasing public safety.
