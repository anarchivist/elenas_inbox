Washington, D.C. 20510                                     Washington,
D.C. 20510

Dear Chairman Jeffords/Senator Kennedy:

I am writing in strong support of [Senator KennedyD,s/your] amendment to
legislation under consideration in the Senate that would increase the
minimum wage to $6.15 an hour by January 1, 2000. Earlier this year,
president Clinton strongly endorsed raising the minimum wage to "help
ensure that we pay people a decent wage and that parents who work hard and
play by the rules can lift their children and themselves out of poverty.
ItO,s right for America and right for AmericaD,s workers."

When we last raised the minimum wage and expanded the earned-income tax
credit, we took important steps to reward work and help millions of
Americans raise their families with dignity.   The real value of the
minimum wage had fallen to nearly a 40-year low by the time President
Clinton signed the last increase in 1996. But even after that increase,
the minimum wageD,s purchasing power remains well below its historic value
in the 1960's and 1970's.   It does not provide enough to lift a family of
[three or two ?] out of poverty. The time has come to give our lowest
paid working families this raise.

Many of us are benefitting from the strongest economy in a generation, and
we can well afford to share our prosperity through another increase in the
minimum wage.  Inflation and unemployment are low and steady, and family
incomes have begun to grow with corporate profits. But millions of people.
are still struggling to make ends meet -- the people who clean our
offices, sew our clothes, serve our food, and care for our children and
our infirm parents. [The Kennedy/your] amendment offers 12 million
Americans a greater opportunity to share in our nationD,s prosperity.
Seventy percent of all workers who would benefit are adults, age 20 or
over, and about three out of five are women, many of whom are the sole
breadwinners for their families.

As people move from welfare to work, one of the most important lessons
they can learn is that work pays. A full-time worker earning the current
minimum wage for 50 weeks of work receives only $10,300.  This is not
enough to move families from dependency to self-sufficiency and create a
long-term attachment to the workforce. Without this minimum wage increase,
too many of these hard-working families will continue to fall below the
poverty line. The minimum wage should be the first rung on the ladder of
opportunity, not a dead end for the working poor.

A one-dollar increase in the minimum wage would make an enormous
difference in the lives of these workers and their families.  It would
mean an additional $2,000 a year for someone working year-round, full-time
-- enough to buy an average family of four 6.5 months of groceries, or pay
for almost 7.5 months rent, or three-quarters of the tuition and fees at a
two-year college.

Opponents of a minimum wage increase argued two years ago, and seemingly
in every previous debate over increasing the minimum wage, that it would
cause inflation and job loss. But since President Clinton signed the last
minimum wage increase into law in August 1996, the economy has created
more than 6 million new jobs, and the inflation rate has been cut nearly
in half.  The unemployment rate is at 4.5% and has been below 5% for more
than 14 consecutive months. Unemployment rates this low have not been seen
for almost three decades.  For teenagers, African Americans, and women,
unemployment is trending down and employment rates are trending up. In


fact, almost 330,000 more teenagers are employed than in October 1996, and
employment is up by nearly 90,000 for African-American teens.

[I urge.you to support Senator KennedyD,s   amendment/1 strongly support
your amendment.]  Our bipartisan efforts    to overhaul the education and
job training system and expand the Earned   Income Tax Credit have
significantly advanced our common goal of   assuring every worker a good job
at a fair wage. Working together, we can    make work pay for AmericaD,s
minimum wage workers.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to
presentation of this report from the standpoint of the AdministrationD,s
program.

                                                  Sincerely,
