TEXT:
As you know, the Senate passed the Wellstone amendment 55-43 as part of
the higher ed reauthorization.  It would allow states to count up to 2
years of college as work under the voc ed cap.  Ten Republicans voted in
favor (Hatch, Snowe, Allard, Jeffords, D'Amato, Stevens, Thomas, Specter,
Chafee, Collins).

We did a Q&A that day that dodged taking a position, but that will be hard
to sustain as the bill moves to conference. Tomorrow, NEC is holding a
meeting with the agencies to go over all the higher ed conference issues,
and we are invited to go and layout how we propose to handle this one.
We can certainly roll Education if they argue we should support it.
However, given this may become high-profile (see today's Post op ed page),
NEC may understandably balk if we say we should take no position. We are
investigating further the dynamics in the House, with the hope that they
could somehow make it go away very early in the process, but that may not
pan out.

We thought about whether this should be a weekly item, but weren't sure
you wanted to open it up in that way.  Any advice?

FYI, here's how the Q&A looked.

Q.      On the higher education bill, a Wellstone amendment to welfare
reform was adopted that supporters say helps welfare recipients who want
to increase their earning potential by allowing college to count as work
for up to two years, but opponents say is a loophole that undermines the
work requirements of welfare reform? What is the AdministrationD,s view?

A.      We have been encouraging colleges to use work-study and other
means to help welfare recipients attend college.  But we have not yet
analyzed the language in the Senate bill.
