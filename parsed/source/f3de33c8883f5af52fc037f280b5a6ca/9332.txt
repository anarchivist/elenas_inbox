Subject: HHS PRESS RELEASE--NEW CDC REPORT

Headline:    New CDC Report Cites Drop in Sexual Risk Behaviors Among Teens

        The percentage of sexually experienced high school students
decreased
substantially from 54.1 percent in 1991 to 48.4 percent in 1997, according
to a report released today by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

        "For the first time in two decades, fewer young people are
engaging in
sexual behavior that puts them at risk for HIV infection, other sexually
transmitted diseases and pregnancy," said HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala.
AThis positive trend represents a reversal of the increasing rates of
sexual intercourse among adolescents that began occurring in the1970s and
1980s.  It is truly good news for all of us involved in the lives of
America;s teenagers."

           The report, published today in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly


Report, uses data from CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System for
the years 1991-1997. This survey measures the prevalence of health-risk
behaviors among adolescents through representative national, state, and
local surveys conducted biennially.

        Percentages of high school students who reported ever having sexual
intercourse in 1997 range from 38 percent in grade 9 to 60.9 percent in
grade 12. This compares to the 1991 figures of 39 percent for grade 9 and
66.7 percent for grade 12.

        The overall percentage of sexually experienced males decreased from
57.4 percent in 1991
to 48.8 percent in 1997, while females showed a slight decrease from 50.8
percent in 1991 to 47.7 percent in 1997.

        As a result of decreases in the proportion of high school students
who
are sexually experienced, decreases in the proportion of high school
students having multiple sex partners, and increases in condom use among
students who are sexually active, fewer young people nationwide are
engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for HIV infection, other
STDs, and pregnancy, the report says. These reductions in sexual risk
behaviors are occurring at the same time as teen pregnancy and gonorrhea
rates are also decreasing. According to today=s report, condom use among
students who are sexually active increased during that same time frame from
46.2 to 56.8 percent.

        "Today's news is very encouraging, but much more needs to be done
to
address the mUltiple epidemics of teen pregnancy, STD and HIV infection,"
said Dr. James Marks,  director of CDC's National Center for Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. ADespite the improvements seen
here, too many youth remain at risk. Half of all HIV infections in the U.S.
occur among young people under age 25 and HIV infection is the sixth
leading cause of death among 15-24 year olds in the U.S.," Marks said.

        In addition, 3 million cases of sexually transmitted diseases occur
each year among teens, and up to 1 million teens become pregnant in the
U.S. each year.  Teen pregnancy rates have also been decreasing
significantly, however,  with declines from 1992 to 1995 in all of the 42
states with available data.

        "This is good news but also a road map of work left undone," said
Dr.
Helene Gayle, director of CDC's National Center for HIV, STD, and TB
Prevention.  "Clearly this is not a one-shot deal, and no single approach
will effectively reach all teens. But these data do demonstrate that we
can achieve the two critical goals of delaying sexual activity for teens
wherever possible and providing teens who are sexually active the tools
needed to save their lives."
