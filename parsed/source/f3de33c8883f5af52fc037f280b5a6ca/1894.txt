    On April 24th, the Medicare Trustees (Secretary Shalala, Secretary Rubin, and Acting Secretary
    Metzler) will release the annual Medicare Trust Fund report. Its findings and recommendations
    will not deviate significantly from last year's report. Although the White House cannot review
    the actual document, we do know that the report concludes that the Medicare HI Trust Fund:
    (1) is still projected to become exhausted in 2001; (2) requires prompt legislative action to
    address the short-term financing challenging facing the program, and (3) is facing much greater
    financing problems in 2010 and beyond (when the "baby boomers") start to retire, which
    necessitates some type of bipartisan process to review and make recommendations to address.

    The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee have already
    requested that Secretary Shalala testify on the 29th and the 30th respectively. At this point, she
    is scheduled to be out of town. Even if she cannot testify, we fully expect that Secretary Rubin
    will be asked to appear before the Committees.

    It is currently unclear how the Republicans are going to react to the release of the report.
    It is possible that they will attempt to use it, once again, to chastise us for not reforming the
    Medicare program. However, since we are on stronger ground than we have ever been (because
    we have the only proposal on the table and it extends the life of the Trust Fund to 2007), the
    Republicans may hesitate to be overly critical. Ifwe are concerned about the former, we may
    want to think about preempting potential RepUblican criticisms by using the release of the report
    to challenge the Republicans to move more promptly on the budget and Medicare reform
    discussions.

    The best outcome for both sides interested in a budget agreement, however, may well be for
    everyone to recognize but not politicize the release of the report. We will be working toward
    that end early next week and apprise you of our read of this situation.
