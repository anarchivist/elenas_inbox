TEXT:
We just learned this evening that AIDS Action is releasing a report card
grading the Federal government's success -- or lack there of -- in
responding to the challenge of HIV/AIDS. The government, although not
explcitly the Clinton Administration, received "As" for research and
domestic treatment programs but received a "D'" for prevention initiatives.
Most notably, however, AIDS Action awarded an 'F' for efforts to address
the international crisis.  They released their report card notwithstanding
their knowledge about the President's event today.

Chris complained to Sandy who was "unaware of the document but immediately
confronted Ex. Director Daniel Zingale. Daniel stressed that this was a
government wide report card and stated that he will be quite supportive
tomorrow of our new initiative. However, Chris talked to at least one
wire story that apparently has this report card and is likely to include
it in their coverage. Chris assured that the reporter was aware of the
AIDS Action's position on our initiative and he indicated that he received
generally favorable quotes from Zingale for his story.

Sandy is drafting q&as for our review. Clearly we will have deal with this
to the extent that it is covered by the media.
