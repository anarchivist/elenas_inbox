TEXT:
We are debating whether someone should alert Michael Weinstein of the
NYTimes editorial board about the President's statement today at the
disability meeting:  he has asked SSA to report to him in 30 days about
problems the advocates are reporting in SSA's review of 260,000 children
to see if they meet the new SSI standard. We hear the Times will run an
editorial criticizing SSA for making mistakes in these reviews, and
endorse a moratorium on further reviews till SSA is sure that all problems
are ironed out. SSA just told the Times that today Ken Apfel promised a
top-to-bottom review of this process within 30 days after he is named
commissioner.   We don't know when the editorial will run; it doesn't
sound like it will be tomorrow.

I am more inclined not to do so.   We have been consistent in letting SSA
take the lead in this story, so it may be unwise to insert ourselves into
the picture at this point.  Plus, he didn't call for a moratorium, which
is what the Times wants -- SSA would continue to review children's cases
and might be almost finished by the time the 30 days are up, as an
advocate pointed out to us today.

On the other hand, if the editorial does say "the President should do
something about this," the President might feel dismayed that we didn't
get the word out that he has taken at least this step.  (Then there is the
question of who talks to them.)  Views on this are welcome.
