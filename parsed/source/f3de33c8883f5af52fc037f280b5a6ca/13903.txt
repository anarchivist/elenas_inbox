      Elena--
      I just received your note requesting "the more general" product liability
      letter so that you can compare them.   The attached email contains the most
      recent draft that I worked on. However, as you probably recall, we also sent
      out some Presidential letters that were simply shorter versions of the detailed
      product liability letter -- here is that letter:
       Thank you very much for your kind words
      regarding my veto of product liability
      legislation.
            As you know, I believe our legal system
      needs reform, and I have repeatedly urged
      Congress to pass limited, meaningful product
      liability measures.   However, I vetoed the
      product liability bill Congress sent to me
      because I concluded that it unduly interfered
      with state authority and tilted the legal
      playing field against consumers.
            I look forward to your continued
      involvement as my Administration works with
      Congress on this matter.
                           ###

      thanks for your help,
      Jeff

      Elena--
      The President has received a good deal of mail over the past couple of months
      from the general public relating to product liability reform. About 75% of the
      letters deal with the legislation that the President vetoed and 25% deal with
      product liability reform in general. As you may know, for the most part my
      office does not usually see letters from the general public;  rather, we respond
      to letters from elected officials and other vips.
      The office that opens the President's letters catagorizes mail from the general
      public as it comes in, but, for instance, the letters that have been written
      regarding the product liability legislation are clumped together with the
      general letters on this topic. Therefore, in responding to all of these
      letters, we need to craft a single letter that deals with product liability as a


whole, but that also addresses the legislation that Potus vetoed.  I've written
a draft, and I'm wondering if you can give me some guidance on what would be
appropriate for Presidential response.
You've been very helpful over the past few months, and I really appreciate your
help.
Here's my draft:
Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts regarding product
liability. I appreciate having your perspective on this issue.
My Administration believes our civil justice system can and
should be improved.  In this effort, we must ensure that reform
is respectful of the state's important role in the federal
system, as well as fair to all parties.
Earlier this year, I vetoed the product liability bill because it
went against this belief. Not only did it inappropriately
intrude on state authority, i t also seriously impaired the
ability of consumers to gain fair and adequate compensation for
their injuries.  In particular, I opposed completely eliminating
joint liability for non-economic damages, placing arbitrary caps
on punitive damages, and restricting a person's right to sue
after fifteen years without regard to the useful life of the
product in question.
I continue to believe that Congress can pass limited, but
balanced, product liability reform, without resorting to measures
which would harm the consumer. As I continue working with
Congress to achieve this end, I appreciate having your
perspective and encourage you to stay involved in the future.
                         ###
thanks,
Jeff
