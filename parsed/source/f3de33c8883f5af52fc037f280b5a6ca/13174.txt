TEXT:
I am faxing you DOJ's redraft of its welfare reform conferee letter. Note that
DOJ has recrafted the letter's child support enforcement section. DOJ did not
delete mention of the "Califano v. Jobst" paragraph--it's been footnoted.  DOJ
also failed to delete the "caste system" sentence.
If you plan to comment on the DOJ letter, please coordinate your response.  I
would appreciate your comments by 3:30 PM TODAY.   Thanks!
