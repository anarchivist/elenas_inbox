TEXT:
We talked to Daschle's staff and it looks like we should be able to work
through the changes to the legislation.   They are: (1) amending some of
the findings (as suggested by DOJ); (2) exempting the United States from
punitive damages awards; and (3) removing the data collection section and
replacing it with a Sense of the Senate that the government should take
steps to improve data collection.   I will send you the edits from Justice
and draft sense of the Senate language.

Assuming that you and the NEC sign off on the policy, the Women's Office
is going to set up an event planning meeting tomorrow morning.  Please let
me know if you have any problems.  Thanks, Mary
