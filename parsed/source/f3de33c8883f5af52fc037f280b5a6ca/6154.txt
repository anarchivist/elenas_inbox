TEXT:
Can you take a shot at a short options memo for the tobacco mtg.? I'll be
with the Blue Dogs till 10, so if you could get close to a draft, we could
show it to Larry Stein and still get it to EB before noon.

I was thinking of something like:

A group has been meeting in recent weeks to develop consensus options on
tobacco strategy (say who's in the group).  We're also running an
interagency process to develop administration positions and negotiating
options on the key unresolved issues (esp. civil liability and farmers,
but also a few others).  You might say a few sentences on what's going on
in Congress -- hearings, etc.

Process options:

1. Committee-Driven: Waxman-Bliley, bipartisan comm-by-comm in Senate
(maybe Durbin-McCain)

Pros:  1. House 1st
2. If they reach a deal, it sails (Waxman trusted by public health)
3. Good substance

Cons:  1. Vast diff to bridge, esp on liability
         2. Waxman/public health are moving target, don't want this as much
as we do
         3. More bad news keeps us offf track

2. Leadership Driven
Pros:  1 May be only way to overcome multiple juris, have to do .it in the
end anyway
2. Both sides need cover
3. Bravado

Cons: Dems may call backroom deal
House R's may be too divided to go along
2. Leader
