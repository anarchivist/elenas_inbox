Q:      What is your response to TodayD,s USA Today article on your
fraud and abuse enforcement activities? '

A:      Since the President has been in office, he has made enforcement
against fraud, waste, and abuse job number one.  Since 1993, the
AdministrationD,s efforts have saved taxpayers more than $20 billion, with
health care fraud convictions increasing by more than 240 percent. The
Administration has assigned more federal prosecutors and FBI agents to
fight health care fraud than ever before. In addition, HIPAA created, for
the first time ever, a stable funding source to fight fraud and abuse, and
in FY1997 alone -- the first full year of funding under HIPAA -- nearly $1
billion in fraud and abuse savings was returned to the Medicare Trust
Fund.  Tomorrow, we will be joining AARP in a 30 city training session to
utilize Medicare beneficiaries and their advocates as yet another partner
to combat this problem. The President is very proud of our success in this
area and has urged HHS and Justice to do everything that is possible to
ensure that not one dollar of our health care resources are wasted in fra
ud and abuse.
