MEMORANDUM FOR BRUCE REED AND ELENA KAGAN

FROM:                     DPC Team Leaders

SUBJECT:                  Appropriations Riders

Commerce/Justice/State

Visas for Agricultural Workers: High priority; important for the Hispanic and Labor
communities (if we are doing constituency specific one-pagers)

Department of Justice/State Ethics Rules: This provision to allow state ethics rules to be
applied to the U.S. Attorneys is strongly opposed by Justice and prosecutors groups. We should
join the Department in vigorously opposing this provision.

Brady Handgun Insta-Check System: The Brady rider should be strongly opposed. It
undermines implementation of the permanent Brady provisions in two ways: (1) it does not allow
the FBI to charge a user fee for background checks, so funds will have to especially appropriated
for this purpose; and (2) it does not allow the FBI to retain record of checks, so Brady
implementation would need to be delayed for about 6 months until the software is reconfigured.
OMB, DPC and Justice are currently working out a bottom-line compromise, in case it is
necessary.

INS Fees: High priority; also important for the Hispanic community; would remove $166
million from the Exams Fees account (which would ordinarily be used for immigration services,
including naturalization processing) and use it to fund discretionary programs.

Visas for Foreign Nurses: Low priority; we opposed, but the provision now includes better
labor protections and is a small number targeted to inner-city areas.

Abortions for Federal Prisoners: We should continue to oppose the prohibitions on funding
abortions for federal prisoners except in the case of rape or where the life of the mother is
endangered. However, this prohibition is in both the House and Senate bills and is current law.

Controlled Substances Act: We should strongly oppose the changes to this Act, which would
reduce the record-keeping requirements and penalties that work to prevent precursor chemicals
from be diverted to illegal markets.
                                                                             ement system
                                                      Automated Records Manag
                                                      Hex-Dump conversion

Coordinated Drug Strategy: Although we do not support this unnecessary and duplicative
requirement to have Justice develop its own drug strategy for drug prosecutions, it is not worth
fighting over.

Limitation on INS Non-Career Appointments: Low priority; this is part of appropriations
language. We asked in FY99 budget that the limitation be deleted (limited INS to four Schedule
C employees, including the Commissioner). Included in both House and Senate. Very little
chance of getting this out.

Assault Weapons: We support language in the Treasury-Postal appropriations to allow ATF to
compensate for their losses a very small group of persons with permits to import certain modified
assault weapons.

Gun Prosecutions: Although Justice is concerned with a $1.5 million earmark for U.S.
Attorneys to focus on gun prosecutions in Philadelphia, we can accept this amendment. We just
need to be sure that the final language does not mandate what cases the U.S. Attorney's office has.
to take. Additionally, we should make sure that the final language does not re-write the
President's Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative or impose any undue burdens on U.S.
Attorneys in general.


Interior

Pro-rata Allocation of Contract Support CostslIndian Health Service: High priority -- this
provision would reallocate the way Indian Health Service funding is given to tribes with the
result that many tribes will lose hundred of thousands of dollars.

Bureau oflndian Affairs and Indian Health Service Tribal Contract Moratorium: High
priority -- this provision would interfere with tribal self-determination by prohibiting tribes that
want to contract to provide their own health services or other services from doing so (which they
are permitted to do under current law).

Sen. EnziiSessions Amendment on Indian Class III Gaming (BIA): High priority --this
provision would prohibit the promUlgation of the Indian gaming provisions from the Gaming
Commission.

BIA-Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA) Funding: This is a non-issue at this point. Senator
Gorton had wanted funding to be provided to tribes on a means testing basis. Interior worked
out a compromise that would permit a study to be done first.

BIA-Prohibition of Taking Land into Trust Status for Tribes: High priority. Will this
specific provision only affects the Shakopee Sioux in Minnesota, the effect of this provision
would be to prevent BIA from taking lands into trust status for the tribes.



LaborlHHSlEducation

National Testing: The House language effectively bans any additional work on test
development; the Senate language permits pilot testing to proceed this year as planned. We
should negotiate something close to the Senate position, perhaps with additional studies thrown
in (as was done last year) to give Goodling something to claim credit for. Barbara Chow,
Broderick Johnson and I are meeting with Goodling's staff this afternoon to explore their
posit.ion.

Block Grants: The House bill includes language permitting states to shift funds from Goals
2000 to Title VI (an existing block grant). We must oppose this, with no negotiation. Ifkept,
this provision would kill Goals 2000 and eliminate its emphasis on standards and accountability.
It will also be seen as a huge defeat for the Administration, because we lose Goals 2000 and cave
on Block Grants.

There is an even worse block grant bill Sen. Gorton is pushing, that would consolidate a large
number of programs (Goals 2000, professional development, technology, etc.), end their purpose,
and provide no accountability. It also contains a version of Ed-Flex (which allows states to
waive federal requirements) which we should also oppose, because it is way too broad in its
scope, and because there are no accountability provisions to go along with the added flexibility.

Ifwe need to negotiate in this area, our alternative should be the bipartisan Ed-Flex bill
(FristlWyden in the Senate, CastlelRomer in the House) which we support because it
incorporates the principles we articulated earlier this year when POTUS proposed Ed-Flex
expansion to NGA. NGA is also supporting this bill.

Bilingual Education: This rider contains a 2-year limit on participation in bilingual education,
with an absolute cut-off of participation after 4 years. It also has provisions that strengthen
accountability and expand flexibility in the existing bilingual ed program. Substantively, we
must oppose with no negotiations the time limit and cutoff. While we might be able to work out
flexibility and accountability language to our substantive satisfaction, politically we will never
work that out in this context to the satisfaction of the CHe.

Family Planning: Our draft SAP strongly objects to language in the Committee bill and any
proposed amendments that require family planning grantees either to receive parental consent or
provide advance notification to parents before giving contraceptives to minors. Mandating
parental consent discourages minors from seeking health care and reproductive services and thus
leads to more unintended pregnancies, more abortions, and more sexually transmitted diseases,
including HIV. Federal health program costs could increase if this amendment interferes with
the prevention of teen pregnancy. We would support adoption of the proposed


                                                       Atitdmated Records Management System
                                                       Hex"Dlii:rtp Conversion

 Castle/Greenwood amendment, which would ensure that grantees encourage minors to seek
 Their family's participation in family planning decisions.

 Organ Donation: This has been resolved.

 Medicare Home Health: Although this issue has been under discussion because the interim
 payment system has bee very controversial and there may be efforts to put fixes in report
 language that could be problematic, in part because of excessive budget costs.

 D.C. School Reform: This rider prevents the Education Department from spending funds out
 of a discretionary account (FIE) for DC school reform. In light of the DC budget surplus, this is
 not as big a concern as it once was (according to OMB), and we can live with the language. I
 will double-check this with ED staff working with DC schools and with the First Lady's office, to
 make sure we will not be limiting our ability to take action in support of DC school reform.

 IDEA Riggs Amendment: We have and should continue to oppose this provision, which limits
 the ability of ED to enforce IDEA, with regard to providing educational services to disabled
 18-21 year olds.

 There is also a Livingston amendment on IDEA that may come up c_ it would allow school
 officials to remove indefinitely (as opposed to for 45 days and then going to a hearing officer)
 kids with disabilities who bring weapons or drugs to schools, or who engage in violent behavior
 which could be harmful to other kids. We shoul4 oppose this flat out. If this doesn't work, we
 have developed with OMB and ED several fall back positions: (1) codify the reg that ED will
 release soon, that will allow schools to repeat 45-day expulsions over and over as long as the
 hearing officer agrees; (2) propose an independent study (NAS or GAO) to evaluate
 implementation of new law, and determine if changes are needed; (3) propose specific wording
 changes to remove most objectionable provisions of Livingston amendment.

 Viagra: This is being resolved.

 Organ Reallocation: Could be a major problem. Congress may undermine our current
 position on how organs are reallocated .

. CHIP reallocation Issues: There are a number of state reallocation problems that we
  are trying to resolve, including Washington state, that we are in negotiations about.

 Pennsylvania Medicare DSH problem: This may show up on a rider. We want to try
 to work out something for the state on. Unclear if it will happen in appropriations
 context, but it is a possibility.

 Foreign Operations                                        Hex-Dump Conversion


Mexico City Abortion Language: The President has issued a veto threat on this language in
the past, and said he would veto it again. The House bill contains which would prohibit foreign
non-governmental organizations from receiving US family planning funds if the organization
uses any of its own funding from non-US Government sources for abortion-related services or
advocacy. The Senate bill does not contain this, and the conference is once again at an impasse.


Treasury/General Government

Federal Election Commission (FEC): A rider for which we thought we had a compromise has
beenrebom. McConnell, in retaliation for the General Counsel of the FEC's recommendation to
restrict soft money, included a rider on the Treasury, Postal Appropriations bill in the that would
require that four of the six commissioners vote to retain the General Counsel in his current
position. Currently, no vote is necessary. Only when you hire a new General Counsel is a vote
necessary.

We had a compromise in the House bill, where Livingstone had originally put forward this rider.
It would have allowed the current General Counsel to keep his job, then institute this new
voting procedure on retention for future General Counsels.

Abortion: We oppose this language which prevents FEHBP coverage for abortions for federal
employees, except in cases ofrape and incest, and when necessary to save the life of the woman.
This restriction has been the law for the past few years.

Prescription Contraceptives: We support this language, which would require plans
participating in the FEHBP program to provide coverage of prescription contraceptives.


VAlHUDlIndependent Agencies

HUD: Public Housing Reform Legislation: Although still some problems, most of the
differences have been resolved and Cuomo has scheduled a news conference to announce a
compromise agreement.

HUD: Director of Mark-to-Market Program Office: No longer an issue because Director is
about to be confirmed.

HUD: Single-family Property Disposition: Resolved in our favor.

HUD: FHA Mortgage Limit: Compromise achieved.

    HUD: Homeless Assistance Grants: Congress included a 30% set-aside which we opposed.
    Can't win this fight.

    HUD: Ninety-day Delay of Reissuing Vouchers and Certificates (Section 8): Republicans
    took out which frees up another 40,000 vouchers. Good news for us.

    EPA: Brownfields Cleanup Funding: Has been resolved in our favor.


    Agriculture/Rural Development

    Prohibition on Use of Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) Funds to do Research and
    Program Evaluations: The conference provides that a small portion of research on
    nutrition programs be conducted by the FNS, however, the bulk of that research would be
    provided by the Economic Research Service. USDA would urge Congress to allow all
    research to be conducted by FNS.

    FDA Drug Reviews/RU-486: This rider has been dropped from the conference report.

    USDA Rural Development: The conference report blocks use of mandatory funding
    under Fund for Rural America. We urge the conference to remove this provision.

    Country of Origin Labeling -- New issue: This is currently going to be a study, I put in a
    call to NEC but because of relations with Canada, I don't think we had agreement to push
    this.


    District of Columbia

    Abortion: This amendment would prevent unmarried couples in DC from jointly adopting or
    becoming foster parents. We strongly oppose the amendment because it would interfere in
    caseworkers decisions about the best interests of the child and with matters of state and local
    policy. While the amendment would affect the ability of all unmarried couples to adopt, it
    clearly targets gay and lesbian couples.
