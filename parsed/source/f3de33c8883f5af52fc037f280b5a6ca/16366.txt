 I received a call from Mary Elizabeth Teasly from the NEA yesterday
 indicating that they rec'd dozens of calls from their members inquiring
'about the President's new teachers education proposal that was announced
 at the NAACP.   They didn't know the President was going to make this
 announcement and was blind-sided in the press.   I remember raising this
 with one of my colleagues.   For those who don't know, the NEA has been a
 major supporter of the President dating back to the '92 campaign.     They
 are often called to rally the troops on behalf of the President and
 Vice-President.    Sylvia I suggested to Mary that she give you a call for
 more details.
