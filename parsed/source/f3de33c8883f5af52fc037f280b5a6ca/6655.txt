TEXT:
We really need to discuss the timeliness and quality of briefing papers.
The quality is generally very good, but the timeliness is becoming a big
problem and hurting the quality.  I know DPC has a lot of events, and
Christa is often a one-woman show, but stuff has got to get to us sooner.
Lately, the entire book has been ready to go to the Residence save for the
DPC paper.

I know you want to see everything that goes to the President, which is
fine, but we've got to get it sooner -- 6:00ish rather than
8:30ish-9:00ish.

Let's discuss,   if you have a moment.
