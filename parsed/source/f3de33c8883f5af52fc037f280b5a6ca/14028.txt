TEXT:
Emily tells me that they talked to LA County about the food
stamp/immigrant issue. The county said that, while they were
surprised Wilson would ask for this, they did not think it was a
trick, and thought it would be great. We told them it's not at
all clear it's doable, to keep expectations down.
So, at this point, we're waiting from a further read from Elena
(sorry, Elena).
