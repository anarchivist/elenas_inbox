    TEXT:
    In the tradition of the Greenland/Canadian you know what, the National
    Referendum, South Africa Free Trade Agreement, Citizen Frank, and others,
    I am offering up my annual big idea just in time for the New Year. This
    is in very rough draft.

    One Year Mandatory Military Service

    Proposal: Require all male and females u.S citizens age 18 to serve one
    year in the United States Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,
    coast Guard, National Guard). Citizens could opt out of the Armed Forces
    and join America Corp instead,  but less benefits would be available.

    The Armed Forces could utilize soldiers not only for military service, but
    for infrastructure work with the corp of engineers. This would include
    road and rail work, canal and dams, school buildings, and bridges.

    Advantages:

    Military service provides good mental and physical training, instills a
    sense of pride in one's country, gives soldiers a chance to learn a
    particular skill, and creates an environment for soldiers to mature more
    rapidly. Service also gives individuals a sense of responsibility and
    accomplishment.

    VA Benefits -- All one-year veterans would be eligible for limited medical
    coverage at VA hospitals (major surgery but not the full benefits
    available to longer-term veterans). This would provide a limited health
    coverage base for almost all Americans in return for their service.
    Americorp veterans would not be eligible for the VA health coverage (cost
    too high) .

    Education Benefits -- All Federal higher education benefits, including
    Pell grants, tax deducations and credits, and GI bill grants, would be
    folded into one package available only for individuals who complete their
    mandatory military or national service. This will limit cost.


Disadvantages

Cost.

Happy Holidays!
