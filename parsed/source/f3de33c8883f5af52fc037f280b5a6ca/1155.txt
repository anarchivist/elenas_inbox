TEXT:
I think you are checking with Counsel's office on various questions
surrounding the upcoming brain conference (until approval of new name, I
feel loyalty-driven to call it that!).  I was keeping track of our
questions, which may well be the same as yours:

1.      Can we call it a "WH Conf"?
2.      Can an outside group sponsor parts of it ? (Sat. feed, lunch,
reception)
3.      Can the agencies pay for the up-linking and/or the down-linking
of the satellite?

FYI, we are tentative for the meeting wtih Pat Butler, VP of the Wash Post
Company, at 4pm on Friday (Ann, Melanne, you & whomever else it makes
sense to have -- although I think this one should be small.)
