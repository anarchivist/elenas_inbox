TEXT:
Tomorrow, Congressional Black Caucus is hosting an issues forum on
Community Empowerment/Welfare to Work. We just reviewed, and made a few
improvements to, Slater's remarks. He talks about importance of
public/private partnerships, case load declines, business involvement
through W2W Partnership, federal hiring successes, Access to Jobs (thanks
CBC memberse for this help on this), and then introduces one of DOT's
welfare to work hires--Monique West.   This is pretty much what he did at
the Welfare to Work transportation summit that DOT and the Partnership
held on Monday and it worked well (and even made a little news in the
Post) .

 I understand Herman and Alvarez are also speaking but haven't seen their
speeches. Rodney Carroll, on loan from UPS to the Partnership, and
someone from United are also speaking, along with the women who runs the
cleaning company that has contract for federal buildings that we mentioned
today.
