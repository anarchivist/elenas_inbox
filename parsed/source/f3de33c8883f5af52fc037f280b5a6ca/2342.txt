Update:  Transportation is drafting the RFP to   notify states of the
funding for the 2-4 state demonstration.   The   notice will state that
there is $2 million in the current fiscal year   to fund this
demonstration.   I'm pushing Transportation to   nail down a date on when
they will publish the RFP.
