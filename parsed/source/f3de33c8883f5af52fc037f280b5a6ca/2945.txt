TEXT:
I spoke to Sawhill, who will fax me her draft study -- not for
circulation, but it's okay to write to the President about it.  She's
making some changes this afternoon, and will fax after that -- hopefully
in time for the weekly.  I'll let you know.

Phil Levine spoke to Bob Lehrman, who actually has no "study" -- despite
NPR's description.  He had simply eyeballed some data on New York City and
Indianapolis and spoke to the reporter about it.

We should get the Lehrman study -- and also the study by Sawhill mentioned
in today's Wall St Journal -- and do either weekly items or a full-dress
memo about them.  Thanks.
