Subject:         Waxman

Wants to talk to Erskine about Clean Air rules and tobacco. Re. tobacco,
he's likely to raise both process and substance.    He'll argue there's no
need to work on Mike Moore's timetable, that the industry will continue to
have an incentive to deal through the fall since they are scared not of
Moore's suit but of Minnesota's, which starts in January. Waxman's
substantive concerns include: restrictions on FDA regulatory authority;
limits on liability; failure to address international arena; meaningless pe
nalty for not reducing sales to kids.
