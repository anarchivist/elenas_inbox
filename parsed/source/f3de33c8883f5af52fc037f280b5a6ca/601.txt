Martha,
I just talked to Elena.  I'm sorry I didn't talk to you before sending the
e-mail out.  I was assuming, perhaps incorrectly, that there are enough people
working on this issue now that it's not necessary for me to remain involved.
I have been happy to work on this issue when needed, especially to help move the
report through the draft stages.  However, this is taking up a good deal of my
time while this issue isn't really consistent with the mission of the DPC. Now
that there are plenty of people who want to handle the work -- Nicole included
-- it seems a natural to pass it on so I can put my time back into the social
policy issues I'm working on.
However, if there is a role in this you think I need to play, let me know and I
am happy to do it.
Again, I am sorry for the rash action.
