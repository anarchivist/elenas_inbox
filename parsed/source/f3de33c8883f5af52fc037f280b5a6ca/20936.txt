Subject: Log Cabin's Action Alert on Hefley Amendment

August 4, 1998

LOG CABIN REPUBLICANS ACTION ALERT


A vote is expected on the floor of the House of Representatives TODAY on
the Hefley Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill.
This is the amendment which seeks to roll back all the non-discrimination
policies in the federal government which include sexual orientation.  It is
a defining moment for the 105th Congress    CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES TODAY
AT 202-225-3121 AND URGE THEM TO VOTE NO ON THE HEFLEY AMENDMENT! !


July 30, 1998

TO:      GOP Members of Congress

FROM:   Richard Tafel, Executive Director


VOTE NO ON THE HEFLEY AMENDMENT

I. IT IS BAD POLICY
        On CNN's "Crossfire" last week, Rep. Bob Barr (R-GA), a leading
supporter of the Hefley Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State
appropriations bill, said he believes in discriminating against gays and
lesbians.  Passage of the Hefley Amendment will mean that the 105th
Congress agrees with Rep. Barr. That will be the message to your
constituents, to your campaign supporters. to your colleagues in the House
and to the staff members you employ in your own office -- if you vote yes
on the Hefley Amendment.
        Rep. Joel Hefley (R-CO) wrote recently to you that his amendment is
merely to ensure that gays do not receive affirmative action as a result of
federal non-discrimination policies. LOG CABIN REPUBLICANS IS FIRMLY
OPPOSED TO AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. We are giving our organization's highest
award to Proposition 209 leader Ward Connerly at our national convention
next month. THE FACTS ARE CLEAR: IT IS ALREADY ILLEGAL (42 U.S.C. 2000e)
TO EXTEND ANY FORM OF TITLE VII REMEDIES ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION


 TO FEDERAL WORKERS. There is nothing about the President's executive order
 that can possibly change that.

 II. IT IS WRONG POLITICALLY FOR OUR PARTY

 A poll published in The Hill on July 29 showed the following:

 -- Americans support President Clinton's executive order banning
 discrimination against gays in federal hiring and employment by 66-24.
 The Hefley Amendment would roll back this order.

 -- Even the GOP base -strong Republican voters - back Clinton's order by
 50-41.
 Very conservative "strong" Republicans would either be less likely to
         support or say it would make no difference in their votes by 54%.

 A poll conducted by the Republican Leadership Council showed the following
 [Kieran Mahoney & Associates - National Survey of Swing Congressional
 Districts, July 17-20, 1998]:

         Question: DO YOU FAVOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSING LEGISLATION
 IN SUPPORT OF A SPECIFIC MORAL AGENDA?
         58% all voters OPPOSED
         55% of Republicans OPPOSED
         60% of Independents OPPOSED
         Voters are more likely to support a Republican candidate for
 Congress focused on economic issues over "moral issues" by a 58.6% to 18.9%
 margin.
         Ticket-splitters agree with the GOP economic agenda 44.5% to 30.4%.
 Independents agree 41.4% to 34.4%.
         Ticket-splitters DISAGREE with the GOP agenda on moral issues "like
 gay rights" -- 40.7% to 22.4%.
         Independents DISAGREE with the GOP agenda on moral issues "like
         gay rights" -- 52.3% to 19.5%.
         Question: DO YOU FAVOR EXCLUDING HOMOSEXUALS FROM LEADERSHIP
 POSITIONS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE THEY ARE GAY?
         61% of Republicans OPPOSED

  BAD POLICY.

  BAD POLITICS.

  VOTE NO ON THE HEFLEY AMENDMENT TO THE COMMERCE, JUSTICE, STATE
 APPROPRIATIONS BILL.

 There is NO middle ground.
