TEXT:
It looks less and less likely that we'll be 'ready for a welfare radio
address this Saturday. We should be ready for next Saturday.

By tomorrow, HHS will have case load data for only 43 of the 50 states
the APWA meeting in San Francisco is apparently slowing them down.

I just got the revised DOL competitive grant application -- we will have a
few changes, but that should be ready shortly.

The HUD funds apparently went out the door already -- we didn't indicate
our interest soon enough.
