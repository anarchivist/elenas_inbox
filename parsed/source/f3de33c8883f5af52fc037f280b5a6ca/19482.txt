    TEXT:
    Governor Voinovoich has decided not to apply for $88 M in Welfare to Work
    formula grant funds.  He sent a letter to Secretary Herman today and
    issued a press release.  "In lieu of this new, and somewhat duplicative,
    grant program, Ohio is developing a more flexible employment and training
    program for long-term, hard-to-place TANF participants utilizing a portion
    of the state's unobligated TANF funds".  Other reasons he cites: TANF $


are more flexible,  data reporting burden, match requirement, and WtW regs
complicate linkages between county commissioners (OH is a
county-administered welfare system) and PICs.   The new program they've
developed with unobligated TANF $ will be operated by County Boards and
PICs, and will require sign off by mayor or county commissioner.    I'll
fax Bruce, Keith, Larry, Emil and Fred a package with Herman's statement,
Voinovich's press release, letter, and fact sheet about their alternative
program.  If anyone else wants it, let me know.

Herman has issued a strong statement expressing her disappointment that
these funds will not be available to help move hardest to serve welfare
recipients towards self-sufficiency (she specifically mentions how it
would have helped cities like Cleveland, Toledo and Youngstown) .

DOL also says that Judy Haveman is writing a story (probably for Sunday)
on states who are deciding not to apply for these funds.  I'll get more
info about the story and do Q&A for Monday.
