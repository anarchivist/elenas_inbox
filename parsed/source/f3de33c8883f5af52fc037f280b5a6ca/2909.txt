TEXT:
I spoke briefly with Jen this morning, and she thought we might want to
consider sending to Sylvia and Rahm the draft exec memo on Title IX so
that it is on their radar screen, rather than waiting until tomorrow.   If
you agree, do you want me to send it to them and/or others with a note
from you, saying that a revised version will be forwarded tomorrow?
