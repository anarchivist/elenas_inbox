TEXT:
FYI, six representatives from the National Council of Juvenile and Family
Court Judges will be visiting us on Tuesday, Feb. 25 from 1:30-2:30 in
room 211.  You are all welcome to attend the meeting -- it should be very
educational.

The National Council headquarters are in Reno, NV.  It is the largest (and
one of the only) training facilities for juvenile and family court judges
in the country.  They train about half the juvenile and family court
judges in the u.S. as well as others who work with juveniles and
distressed families, including parole officers, social workers, police,
etc.

The Executive Director, Louis McHardy will be visiting as well as Judge
Hornsby (FL), Judge Herrell (OR), Judge Anderegg (MI), Eugene Hunter
Hurst, Dir. National Center For Juvenile Justice (PA) and General Counsel
Tom Madden (DC) to talk about child welfare reform and juvenile justice.
