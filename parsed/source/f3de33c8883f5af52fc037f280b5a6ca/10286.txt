     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:            Bruce Reed

     RE:              DPC Weekly Report

              Health Care -- Medicare Commission update: On Wednesday and Thursday, the
     Medicare Commission met for its first serious discussion of policy options. Next month, it is
     tentatively scheduled to make final decisions and, as such, its work is more likely to become
     more relevant to our internal budget, Social Security, and State ofthe Union discussions. The
     Commission continues to be burdened by relatively weak staffing, poor communication amongst
     its members, and a general sense of disorganization. Despite this, the staff did produce an
     options document that, although seriously flawed, suggested some alternatives that merit
     consideration such as fee-for-service refonns ~, rationalizing the program's cost sharing
     requirements and adding a prescription drug benefit) as well as a "premium support," FEHBP
     model. "Premium support" is a tenn describing a program that concurrently defines mandatory
     benefits while also setting the Government's contribution. (It is similar to a concept advocated
     by Henry Aaron and Bob Reischauer.) Interestingly, although the Democrats -- including our
     own appointees -- are frustrated with the operation of the Commission, they remain engaged
     because of their belief that a premium support approach could -- if done correctly -- provide an
     avenue to establish a new and, in their minds, long overdue prescription drug benefit. Some of
     our members, like Laura Tyson and Stuart Altman, also think the premium support model offers
     the ability to inject more market competition into the Medicare system. To ensure that Senator
     Breaux does not veer too far off the path of an acceptable option to Democrats, Congressman
     Dingell offered (with our assistance) a set of Medicare principles for the Democrats to utilize as
     guideposts in the development of any option. The principles ended up being well received by all
     the Democrats -- including Senator Breaux. (They are attached for your review.)
     Notwithstanding the generally positive momentum that was achieved, the financing, policy,
     political and timing challenges facing the Commission are enonnous. As they are finally
     recognizing the scope of the financing and demographics problem, they are realizing that much
     more than program savings will be necessary to have any chance of significantly extending the
     life the program. The Commission will likely respond by either reducing the time frame they
     wish to extend Medicare's solvency or contemplating how to infuse the program with more
     dollars. We will continue to closely monitor the progress of the Commission; in so doing, we
     will continue to be responsive to the Commission's requests, particularly Senator Breaux in order
     to keep him on track with options that will not totally alienate too many Democrats from this
     process. (ELENA: This one probably justifies a brief memo to the POTUS; I'd like to send in if
     you and Bruce say ok)

General June Gibbs Brown released a report finding that the program managers HCFA contracts
out with to administer and oversee Medicare provider reimbursement do not proactively identify
instances of fraud and abuse. This report is yet another in a series ofIG reports that asserts that
HCF A is not sufficiently cracking down on fraud and/or that the Congress has not provided the
agency with adequate authority to more effectively manage the program. We plan on countering
these reports on Monday at an anti-fraud and abuse event in which you will unveil a series of
program integrity initiatives that will be included in next year's budget. Most of these initiatives
represent a direct response to IG recommendations and, as such, she can be expected to strongly
validate them. We also anticipate that they will be well received by aging advocates, such as
AARP, the National Council of Senior Citizens and others, and viewed as a sign that the
Administration is not waiting for the Medicare Commission to make needed changes in the
program.

         Health Care -- Recommendation of the National Toxicology Board to list alcohol as
a carcinogen: On Wednesday, the National Toxicology Board of Scientific Counselors.
recommended that alcoholic beverages be considered a known human carcinogen. While the
scientists acknowledged other studies showing correlations between moderate alcoholic·
consumption and some positive health outcomes, they concluded that recent studies that link
alcohol consumption with cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus were
sufficiently compelling to necessitate their recommendatioIi. Although this recommendation
must go through several layers of bureaucracy before Secretary Shalala makes a final decision
about this classification next Spring, she rarely overturns a recommendation made by this (or any
other) scientific body. If she does decide to list alcohol in HHS's ninth Report on Carcinogens,
no further regulatory action will be taken. This congressionally-mandated report is used as an
information awareness mechanism to alert the public and regulatory agencies about substances
that have been scientifically linked with increased rates of cancer. Notwithstanding the narrow
scope of action, we can expect a major outcry of displeasure from the wine, beer, and even the
distilled spirits lobby when this recommendation gets publicized.

        Health Care -- CDC reports slight increase in the number of legally induced
abortions: Thursday, the Centers forDisease Control (CDC) reported that the number of
legally induced abortions increased by 0.9 percent between 1995 through 1996 to a total of
1,221,585. The change in the number of abortions reported to CDC may have resulted from
variations in data reporting by state health departments. It could also indicate that the number of
legal abortions in the U.S. is stabilizing. However, because this slight increase in the number of
terminations has occurred for only one year, it is too early to predict any future changes in
abortion trend rates. It is important to note that from 1990 (the year in which the number of
reported abortions was highest) to 1995, the number oflegal induced abortions decreased by 15
percent. In addition, the national abortion rate 0[20 per 1,000 women of reproductive age
continues to be the lowest rate recorded since 1975.

       Health Care -- Hearing held on embryonic stem cell research: On Wednesday, the
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health held a hearing to explore the medical, ethical
                                                             Automated Records Management:'YSlello

    and legal implications of the recent innovations in embryonic stem cell research. Beyond
    spending a great deal of time on the great health care potential of this research (specifically on
    lessening the need for transplantable donor organs and on new treatments for Parkinson's and
    Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, stroke, bums, heart disease,diabetes, osteoarthritis, and
    rheumatoid arthritis), the hearing attempted to determine whether Federal funding for this
    research was legal under the congressionally-mandated prohibition on funding human embryo
    research. (The General Counsel's office at HHS is now reviewing this matter, and we anticipate
    an answer in short order; she will likely conclude that funding for certain stem cell research
    techniques is legal because it uses fetal tissue from terminated pregnancies rather than viable
    human embryos.) Because we had not received the HHS legal opinion and because we did not
    wish to prematurely enter into a potential conflict with the Catholic Bishops and others, we
    thought it advisable to instruct NIH's Harold Varmus -- who testified for the Administration -- to
    defray any comments on the legality of Federal funding ofthis research. However, we should
    soon receive the HHS legal opinion and are working with OSTP and HHS to develop options for
    your consideration on how best to proceed. Regardless, to illustrate that you continue to believe
    there are areas of research we should not go, it would seem wise to continue to highlight your
    1994 executive directive that explicitly prohibits the creation of human embryos for research
    purposes no matter how we proceed.

            Crime -- COPS: On December 11, the COPS Office will announce $77 million in
    grants to over 30 local law enforcement agencies through the COPS MORE (Making Officer
    Redeployment Effective) program. COPS MORE helps law enforcement agencies to purchase
    technology, equipment, and, to hire support staff so that existing officers can be redeployed to
    spend more time on the street in community policing activities. The grants will assist in the
    redeployment of over 3,800 officers.

            Consumer Protection -- Toxic Toys: This week, the Consumer Product Safety
    Commission released the most comprehensive report to date examining the potential exposure
    and health risks to children from teethers, rattles, and toys containing chemicals called phthalates
    that are used to soften plastic. The report concludes that children using these products are not
    exposed to phthalates at levels that might be harmful. For this reason, the CPSC has decided not
    to ban these products. However, the study also identified several areas where additional
    scientific research is needed.. Given remaining uncertainty and the concerns of consumers, the
    CPSC also announced the plans ofa number of manufacturers and retailers to discontinue selling
    certain toys containing a widely used phthalate called DINP and to begin producing toys without
    this chemical. We continue to work with CEQ and the CPSC on possible next steps, including
    other research that we could support. .
