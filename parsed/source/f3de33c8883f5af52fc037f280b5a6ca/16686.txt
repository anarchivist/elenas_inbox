    Civil Rights Investigations of Higher Education in California and Texas

    The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Education is continuing its investigation
    of the current admissions policies at the three University of California law schools.
    Preliminary analysis indicates a significant disparity in the admission rate for certain minority
    group students compared to whites. The investigation is now in an information-gathering phase,
    which is likely to extend through the end of the year. The California investigation has recently
    been attacked by Senators Hatch and McConnell, who wrote Secretary Riley July 31 to denounce
    the inquiry as an affront to the voters of California and a bureaucratic attempt to preserve
    affirmative action. The two senators have called for OCR to abandon the inquiry immediately,
    and have threatened hearings and an amendment to prohibit the use of Department funds to
    investigate race-neutral policies. OCR responds that it is obliged to investigate a legitimate
    complaint, and notes that the investigation concerns current admissions policies, rather than the
    widely-reported decline in minority admissions following the discontinuation ofUC's
    affirmative action program.

    An OCR-initiated investigation of the Texas higher education system, part of a series of state
    higher education desegregation reviews, continues as well. The review will determine,
    consistent with the Supreme Court's Fordice decision, whether vestiges of past discrimination
    remain in the Texas system. The Fordice review has been combined with an investigation of a
    complaint filed with OCR last fall, asserting that Texas continues to operate a dual system of
    higher education and challenging the state's implementation of the Hopwood decision. As with
    California, information-gathering for this investigation is likely to extend through the end of the
    year.
