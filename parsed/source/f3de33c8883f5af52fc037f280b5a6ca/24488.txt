TEXT:
You should have everything -- I think Matt faxed it over this morning.
Please call (57757 or Matt 57760) if you haven't gotten it. We'd like to
wrap this up pronto.

Matt's note said USDA was OK with the construction as it was but wanted to
talk alternative constructions. At this point I'd rather just stick with
what you and they are OK with.
