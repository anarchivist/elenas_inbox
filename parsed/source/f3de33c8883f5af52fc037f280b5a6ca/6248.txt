 TEXT:
 I will relay to CEA our long standing position not to re-open the
 definition of work, and I'll find out what they mean by #2, but the first
 issue -- issues related to recessions    does raise a question:

         The adoption law requires HHS by March 1st to "make
 recommendations to the Congress for improving the operations of the
 contingency fund for state welfare programs."    Diana is checking into
 what they've done so far.

         I think we may be wise to make changes while the economy is good
 and states are flush (we. would need a legislative change, but CBO probably
 wouldn't score changes that would make it easier for states to draw down
 the funds, since I think they assume no one will meet the triggers) .

         Given CEA's interest in this issue, we will probably need to
 involve them in reviewing HHS' recommendations. What do you think?

 Subject:         brainstorming etc.

 Cynthia and Diana,

 I spoke with Rebecca Blank before today's meeting. There are three
 general areas of interest for possible intiatives that I did not get a
 chance to bring up at today's meeting.

 1. Issues related to recessions
 2. Issues related to links between TANF and other programs for the TANF
.'
     population
     3. Allowable work-related activities

     We are interested in finding out whether DPC finds these to be important
     areas for discussion or policy development. At this point, the first two
     would mainly involve thinking and discussion. The third is narrower.  Here
     the question is whether we would like to revisit the restrictions on
     states' ability to count education as a work-related activity in order to
     promote self-sufficiency. I think we understand the arguments for and
     against this exclusion. (I apologize that I do not know the
     administration's previous positions on this issue.)

     Thanks.
".
