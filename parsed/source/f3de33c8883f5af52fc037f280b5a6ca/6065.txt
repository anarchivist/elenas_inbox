 Original Text
 From: "SLDN1" <SLDN1@aol.com>, on 1/17/98 3:42 PM:
 To:

 Secretary of the Navy, John Dalton, has indicated that the Navy will
 discharge
 Senior Chief Timothy R. McVeigh despite evidence that the Navy potentially
 violated both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and "Don't
 Ask,
 Don't Tell, Don't Pursue." The discharge will occur on Wednesday, January
 21,
 1997, unless a federal court orders the Navy to freeze the discharge
 pending


the outcome of a lawsuit filed by McVeigh on Thursday, January 15, 1997.

The Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, and the Commander-in-Chief,
President
William J. Clinton, retain discretion to stop the discharge and avoid
potentially embarrassing litigation.  They, however, need to hear from you
that you are concerned about the government's actions in this case.

The first concern is that the Department of Navy and Department of Defense
violated ECPA by obtaining McVeigh's subscriber information from AOL
without a
warrant, subpoena or McVeigh's consent.  That is a violation of u.s. law.

The second concern is that McVeigh's command initiated an inquiry against
McVeigh based only on a suspicion that the AOL profile was his, thus
compelling the Navy to confirm McVeigh's identity through AOL.  "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell, Don't Pursue" specifically states that suspicions are not
credible
information to start an inquiry.

President Clinton stated in announcing "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't
Pursue"
that the policy would provide "a decent regard to the legitimate privacy
and
associational rights of all servicemembers." Former Secretary of Defense,
Les
Aspin, said that servicemembers would have to work hard to get on the radar
screen under "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Pursue." .Those promises have
failed in this case.

please email, fax & call the following people with your concerns:

McVeigh.  As always, if possible, send us a copy of your correspondence to
