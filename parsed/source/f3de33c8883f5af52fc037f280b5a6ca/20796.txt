TEXT:
This afternoon, Doris Matsui's office informed me of an additional meeting
that might come up at the Asian-American meeting tomorrow.  I prepared the
attached background and talking point, in consultation with Maria E. (it
is an issue that she has worked on since her days at the Labor Dpt.).  I
told Beverly that this was a draft, and that we would let her know of any
changes in the am.  Thanks.

                        INS/DOL Collaboration on Labor Inspections
                                      July 22,1998

Background:

The Immigration Refonn and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) requires the Department of Labor to
detennine, as part of its regular labor inspection process, whether the employer is in compliance
with the requirement that the employer verify whether each of its employees is authorized to
work (as demonstrated by the employer filling out an 1-9 fonn for each employee). If the Labor
inspector finds that the employer has not been filling out the 1-9 fonns (and therefore not
verifying authorization to work), he is required to refer the matter to the INS. The Labor
Department has no authority to sanction the employer for this violation.

Some within the immigrant and labor communities are concerned that the Department of Labor's
role in enforcing the immigration laws might chill the reporting of other labor violations by
undocumented workers.

Talking points:

·      We are aware ofthe concerns about the Department of Labor's role in enforcing the
       immigration laws. We have been engaged in discussions with the DOL and INS to
       detennine the best way to protect the rights of legal workers, consistent with the statutory
       requirements set forth by Congress.
