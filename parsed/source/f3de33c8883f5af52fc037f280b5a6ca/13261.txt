TEXT:
I'm sorry I haven't been able to respond to your inquiry sooner. The last
couple of weeks have been pretty hectic.
Jodie Torkelson makes the ultimate decision as to who is on the clips list. Her
office recently updated the list and your office was likely removed; no doubt
due to Clarissa's departure. Only Ms. Torkelson's office has the authority to
place new people on the clips list. You might want to contact Lorraine Donovan
in her office.  I will be able to provide you with a set of clips as soon as
they give me authorization.
Hope this is helpful.
If you have any questions, I should be in this morning until 11:00 a.m. or so.
