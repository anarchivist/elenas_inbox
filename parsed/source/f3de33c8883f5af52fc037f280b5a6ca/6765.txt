TEXT:
Tobacco: On March 25, Deputy Secretary Summers is scheduled to address
George Washington Universitys School of Public Health on the costs of
smoking in the u.S. and the case for comprehensive tobacco legislation.
Treasury continues to assess the likely effect of tobacco legislation on
the price and on the potential smuggling of tobacco products, and also
continues work on the development of an excess profits tax for the
industry and on preliminary revenue estimates of various Congressional
proposals, including those of Sens. Kennedy, Hatch, McCain, and Conrad.
