TEXT:
Kent Markus of DOJ has requested Lotus Notes email connectivity with you
(see message below). Before I set this up, I need your authorization to
add your name to the Notes WHO address book, which will allow him to
easily address you.   The WHO address book is available to many agencies
who participate in the Notes Xchange network which is used for reporting
information from agencies to the White House.  If you have any questions
about this, please give me a call at X56584.

  please read the notes below.  I've asked Bill Marshall to coordinate with
  Kent Markus with respect to the Brady decision.  The latest rumor is that
  decisions will all come down by June 26.  That leaves three decision dates
  left: tomorrow, June 23 and June 26.

  Elena-- Bill asked that you either stop by the "war room" or be available
  to clear statements on the days that decisions come down on religious
  freedom, Brady, and right to die.

  Thanks.

  Chuck Ruff and Rahm would like to set up a "war room" for the next few
  days in order to organize the statements. -Bill Marshall set up this time
  and place- who should be there? I was thinking about you,·Jose, Elena,
  Barry Toiv and someone in· Waldman's office. Who else? Let me know when you
  get a chance. Thanks
