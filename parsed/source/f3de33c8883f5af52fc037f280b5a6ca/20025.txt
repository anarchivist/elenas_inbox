Elena,
FYI. According to the EEOC, Republicans in the House continue to assert
that support for the proposed increase in the EEOC budget is contingent
upon the EEOC's agreement not to fund the use of employment testers.  They
were told by Fawell's staff that for Gingrich this is still a "line in the
sand." To date, EEOC has not gotten more specific information about the
conditions requested by Gingrich.
Next Thursday at 2:00pm in Room 476, I plan to convene a meeting with WH
Leg. Affairs (Martha Foley, Tracey Thornton, and Broderick Johnson) and
EEOC legal and legislative staff to develop an effective legislative
strategy.  Eddie Correria from WH Counsel's office will also participate.

Julie
