How does this look for a WH-only mtg, preferably tomorrow, on tobacco
legislative strategy?

What db we do about OMB? Invite Raines? Jack? Take a chance that Josh
won't leak?
I assume that for a WH legis strategy mtg, we can leave out HHS and
Treasury. Or should we save ourselves the grief and wait till Thursday,
when Rich comes back to town (and still leave out Treasury, on the theory
that HHS is far and away the lead agency and this is legislative, ·not
policy) ?
