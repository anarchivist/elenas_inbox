TEXT:
Elena,

OMB just faxed me a proposed amendment to HR 3130 that impacts immigration
and child support enforcement, Diana, Cynthia, Steve Mertens and INS
general counsel have also received it. OMB tells me that they need a
Statement of Admin. Policy on this by tomorrow afternoon.

I am faxing you the draft leg,     The parts that might be problematic are
Section 401 (a) (F) (ii), Section 403 (a) (5) (a), and Section 404.

Section 401(a) (F) (i) amends the INA to make an alien "inadmissible" if
they are $5000 or more in arrears in child support payments (under a legal
order to pay).   The problem is the ~ext bit: Section 401(a) (F) (ii) amends
current law to require that a legal premanent resident (LPR) absent from
the country for any period of time meet the "admission" standards
outlined above.    Under current law, only those absent for more the 6
months .are subject to "readmission" scrutiny.

Section 403 authorizes immigration officers to serve process re: child
support enforcement on those applying for admission.  INS may be opposed
to enforcing the SSAct.  Finally, Section 404 would authorize HHS to
release child support information to INS or the Secy of State, upon
request.

I will keep you posted.

julie
