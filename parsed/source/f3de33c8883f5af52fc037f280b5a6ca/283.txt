TEXT:
Just found out (by accident) that Ken finally set up the meeting
with DOJ/OLC on the definition of means-tested programs.    I asked
if it was on Elena's calendar, and they were unsure.
I hear it is Randy Moss, Chris Schrader (sp?), and Ursula Werner
of OLC.
I can go late; I have to speak to a group at 2:45.    Steve and/or
Jeremy, can you go?
Elena, hope you're not on jury duty .... assume you really need to
be there.
