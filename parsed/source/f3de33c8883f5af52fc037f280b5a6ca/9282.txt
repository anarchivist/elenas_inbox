TEXT:
Jose and I put the following (see below) together as the guts of a cover
note from Bruce regarding McCaffrey's letter.

We have a similar issue to resolve on the appropriations bill -- the
Senate Labor/HHS approps bill provides $150 million for ED to carry out a
national competition to award grants to school districts for safe schools
programs, based on proven practices.  ED had requested $125 million that
would be given to states on a formula basis (like the current program) but
with the requirement that the states distribute it on a competitive
basis. ED likes the Senate approach.   However, OMB anticipates that ONDCP
will not like this provision, because it focuses on safety rather than
drugs.  Barbara Chow wants to pull a meeting together soon to figure out
our position for the SAP.  I think this is a good idea--its necessary, and
its an opportunity for me to get a better handle on how to deal with both
the reauthorization issue and the ONDCP staff (who I don't know).

Cover note for McCaffrey letter:


         We have been working with the Education Department on a proposal
to overhaul the Stafe and Drug Free Schools Program, for announcement at
the Oct. 15 Safe Schools Conference.   The Education DepartmentD,s proposal
is similar to ONDCPD,s in many respects -- stronger accountablity
provisions, better targeting of the funds to school districts with the
greatest need, and requirements that the funds be used on research-based
programs with demonstrated effectiveness.   However, whereas ONDCP proposes
to focus this program primarily on reducing youth drug use, the Education
Department proposes to focus it primarily on creating safe and orderly
schools.

         DPC is planning to bring both agencies together to work toward an
agreed-upon approach to overhauling the program.   Such an approach would
include (1) the accountability and targeting components they already agree
upon, (2) strategies that can help keep schools safe and students
drug-free (e.g., clear, firm and fully enforced discipline and drug
policies, better connections between students and adults, and programs
that teach character and responsible decision making) and, (3)
consideration of an increased budget request for an effectively overhauled
program.
