TEXT:
           I never know who gets what from HHS -- so I am sending the
           following two items to Keith for OMB, Elena, and Emily. Bruce,
           let me know if you need them. Diana, I assume you have them.
           They are:

           HHS proposed answers to the 10/23 state questions.  HHS needs our
           clearance on these which are mostly technical.  Please review and
           let me know by Friday morning if you have any problems.

           A summary of the NY welfare proposal from Pataki.


            Let me know if there's any confusion.    Thanks.
