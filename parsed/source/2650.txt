I didn't mean to show so much frustration yesterday.    However,   I really
want this to work for the President. Elena I need your help, especially
your ideas because you are always so clear. Can I spend about 30 minutes
with you at your earliest 'convenience to go over how you think our offices
should work together on One American policy issues.        Thanks.
