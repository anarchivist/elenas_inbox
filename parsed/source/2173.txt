 TEXT:
 I expect you're going to get a call from Bob Rubin suggesting that you
 hold regular meetings on tobacco in which Larry Summers can participate.
 Rubin's essential complaint seems to be that we rely on Treasury people
 for lots of work, but don't bring them in to top-level decisionmaking.    Of
 course, Bruce does have weekly tobacco meetings to which Larry is invited,
.and Treasury people are allover the various tobacco policy processes; we
 also will begin to include their legislative people (Linda Robertson or
 Marty Thomas) in the daily phone calls we have with HHS's legislative
 office. What Rubin seems to feel is missing is the opportunity to sit
 around your table on questions of strategy, as in the budget process.   I
 guess this would mean fairly regular meetings with you, Bruce, Larry
 Stein, Larry Summers, Donna (plus one staff?), Frank/Jack/Josh, Bruce
 Lindsey, Ron, and perhaps someone from Justice.   We should talk about
 whether this would be helpful.
