TEXT:
I forget who asked about whether we could announce our intent to nominate
Satcher, but the view from this office is that we definitely should not.
He has done a lot of writing; some of it may be controversial; we are not
finished reviewing it yet; and we are not prepared to start answering
questions. All in all: we would be buying trouble.
