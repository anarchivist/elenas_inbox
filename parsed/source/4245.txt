TEXT:
Looks good to me, but (1) I think the Americorps glossery should go up
front, so that he knows what Young Heroes, CityYear, etc. are as he's
reading the options; (2) do we really need to give him 11 options? aren't
the first five enough?; and (3) I don't think white and black are
capitalized.
