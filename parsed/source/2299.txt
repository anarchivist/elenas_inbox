You may all know this, but I just got off our weekly call with the
committees and the Hill -- and the Hill folks said they are doing 3 events
that I thought you should know about as we plan for next week:

                Tuesday -        (T)they want to do something on Managed
Care, possibly                           something with the American
Small Business Alliance with the                                 House and
Senate.

                 Wednesday -     (T)Mock Hill hearing with a couple of
stories of witnesses they                                have who are
doctors with stories of how HMO's would not let
                                them treat their patients the way they
recommended and the                              patient suffered
serious health setbacks, and they have a
                                former benefits consultant from a managed
care company who                                 got sick and then
realized how health decisions were getting
                                made.

                Thursday -      Releasing Families USA studies report
reo ERISA study about                           who's not
covered.   Hill wants them to think further about
                                        bringing in a Governor from one of
these states.

                Tuesday - (the 21st)    AMA is doing their yearly "fly
in" to have their                                       association
people on the Hill to lobby, they believe this year
                                the topic will be Patients B of R.
