TEXT:
In case you haven't heard, I'm forwarding you the news that the' 9th Circuit
denied a stay pending appeal of Judge Hogan's ruling against the government in
NFRC v. Glickman.   As noted, the denial of a stay means the government must
immediately begin to release large volumes of old growth timber.   ~t is unclear
what will happen to all this timber if the government eventually wins its appeal
 (which I view as unlikely): that is, no one really knows whether the government
then could rescind its releases.
On another subject entirely, I hear Harold talked with Secretary Pena.   What's
happening on your end?

TEXT:

The Ninth Circuit denied our motion for a stay of the district
court's order.  Oral argument was extremely harsh and very
problematic; many of the questions directed towards the government
attorney were irrelevant and argumentative (does that sound like
an objection!) and directed towards the Senate's attack on Jim
Lyons and issues already decided (in favor of the government)
related to the contempt motion.
Argument on the appeal is set for the week of Jan. 8th.
The consensus of everyone at Justice is that there is no point in
pursuing a rehearing request.   Lois Schiffer is working on a
statement for the press and I'll obviously fax it to you when I
get it.
The consequences of this are that we will begin releasing nearly
230 million board feet of old growth tommorrow morning. There
will be a dramatic increase in protests, press, criticism of the
administration for signing the bill, etc.

Sorry I don't have better news!
