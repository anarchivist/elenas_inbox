Subject:         URGENT: PROPOSED ADMINISTRATION POSITION ON
DOMESTIC/INTERNATIONAL ABORTION/FAMILY PLANNING FOR FY99 BUDGET

The FY99 Budget will include Administration legislative language on
several sensitive issues.  One is abortion and family planning.

In domestic programs, the Administration continues to oppose restrictions
on abortion, even where the Congress has legislated them.
In international programs, US AID now proposes to accept the limitations
enacted last year, arguing that opposing them is not worth the reaction it
will generate.
Martha Foley reports that she is comfortable with this approach for
international programs.  If you are uncomfortable with this approach,
please contact Josh Gotbaum at 5-9188 no later than 2:00 pm Tuesday.
Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will include both in the
appropriations language of the FY99 President's Budget.

This is the comprehensive abortion side by side table.         It is a legal
size, Corel 7 document.
