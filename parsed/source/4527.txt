Subject:         partial birth abortion form letters

I need to update our form letters regarding the administration's partial
birth abortion policy.  Do you have any current policy facts, language,
phrases, etc. I can use? I don't think we've done anything specific on
this in a while, and I'm having a tough time finding any updated info. on
it. Thanks!
