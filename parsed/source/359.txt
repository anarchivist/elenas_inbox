TEXT:
I asked Steve to send you an e-mail, but the basic answer is: no one could
really object to this refugee report (and in fact, DOJ, Ed, and DPC don't
object) because the report doesn't say much of anything. .For example, the
report's main recommendation is that HHS will "engage in consultations" on
the question how to promote economic self-sufficiency among refugees.    The
real work st'arts now, and we should keep on HHS -- in consultation with
DOJ, Ed, and State -- to do it.
