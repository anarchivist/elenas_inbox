TEXT:
No problem. This morning, I gave Justice the best argument I could develop; I'm
now waiting for a view from them as to whether they'd be willing to defend the
action, on my theory or some other.  I'll let you know as soon as I hear
anything.  I told Ken that between waiting for Justice and talking to Leon,
Monday seems the realistic target date for a decision.
