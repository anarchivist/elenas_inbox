TEXT:
I think I'd rather just do the policy piece as part of dpc's weekly,
rather than also create a sanitized version for the President.   (There's
almost nothing I would want to say to him about policy under discussion in
a FOIAble report.)  Is that OK? Of course we'd be glad to send you this
part of our report each week.
