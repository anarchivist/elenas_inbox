TEXT:
well, we strongly favor (and give lots of funds to) the dept of ed's
bilingual program, which provides funds to communities to use (at their
option) in either intensive english classes or bilingual classes.  So I
would say we favor special education programs for children whose first
language is not English, but leave to communities the choice of what those
programs should look like.  I will have Bill Kincaid get you our standard
q&a on this question.  We just recently set up a group to examine our
policy and the way we talk about it in light of the California initative.
