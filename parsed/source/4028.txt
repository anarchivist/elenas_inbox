MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 DPC Weekly Report

         1. Welfare -- Balanced Budget Legislation: The House Way and Means Committee is
moving forward quickly on the welfare portion of the reconciliation bill. The Republicans hope
to have draft legislation this Tuesday and to hold a subcommittee markup on Friday, with full
committee markup to follow the next week. We briefed a bipartisan group of staff on our
welfare-to-work plan on Friday. We emphasized the importance of providing a substantial
portion of the money directly to cities and of applying identical program rules and requirements
to cities and states. We also urged a competitive (rather than formula) program, a performance-
based bonus set-aside, a wide range of allowable activities (including public sector job creation),
and strong anti-displacement language. The Republicans seemed skeptical about giving grants
directly to cities, but clearly have not reached any final decisions on this matter. They were
agreeable to providing some portion (but not all) of the funds on a competitive basis and to
including public sector job creation in the list of allowable uses. They were extremely negative
about establishing performance-based bonuses or drafting any anti-displacement language that is
stronger than the provision in the welfare law. We expect to get an early draft of the legislation
Monday morning and to speak with the same group of staff that evening to register our concerns.

        We have seen no paper on the immigrant provisions and have not yet discussed this issue
with committee staffers. We have heard rumors, however, that trouble us greatly. One is that the
Republican legislation, in contravention of the budget agreement, will offer benefits only to legal
immigrants on the rolls when the welfare law was passed, rather than to any legal immigrant then
in the country. Another is that the legislation will incorporate some of the provisions in last
year's immigration bill that we successfully removed at the eleventh hour, such as the ban on
Medicaid coverage for immigrants with AIDS.

        We also expect the Republican legislation to address the privatization and FLSA issues.
We have heard that the legislation will authorize states to privatize the entire eligibility process
(excluding appeals) for Medicaid, Food Stamps, and WIC. In addition, the legislation will
exempt workfare participants from the FLSA and all other'federallaws; require, independent of
the FLSA, that workfare participants be paid the minimum wage for any hours worked; but then
authorize states to count not only cash assistance and food stamps, but also Medicaid, child care,
and housing benefits toward the minimum wage. The Intergovernmental Affairs office is trying
hard to keep Democratic Governors from attacking our position on FLSA and signing on to this


                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

(or some similar) Republican proposal. Governors Chiles and Carper, however, are very
unhappy with our insistence that the FLSA applies to workfare participants and may well join a
coalition of governors to demand legislative changes.

        2. Welfare -- Litigation: You recently asked whether the Department of Justice must
oppose suits challenging the welfare law's denial of benefits to legal aliens. The Department is
currently the defendant in at least four class actions ofthis kind. The legal theories presented by
the plaintiffs in these cases vary somewhat, but focus on alleged denial of equal protection and
due process to legal aliens. The Department has argued in the cases that the challenged
provisions in the welfare law have a "rational basis" and fall well within Congress's broad
authority over immigration. The Department believes that these constitutional arguments are
strong and that a refusal to defend would undermine the federal government's ability to regulate
immigration and/or provide welfare services in the future.

        3. Welfare Study: A new study, by Mathematica Policy Research and the Institute for
Social and Economic Development, provides one of the first glimpses of what happens to
families who are dropped from the welfare rolls because they reach time limits. The study looks
at Iowa's Limited Benefit Plan (LBP), under which welfare recipients who do not comply with
employment and training requirements -- by failing to sign employment and training contracts or
to keep appointments -- receive three months of regular cash benefits, followed by three months
of reduced cash benefits, and then six months of no benefits. Mathematica found that only 17%
of those initially referred to the LBP ultimately lost benefits. Another 53% rectified their
situation and returned to the main welfare program, while 30% chose to leave the welfare
program entirely before their benefits were scheduled to end.

        Among those whose benefits ended (i.e., the 17%), recipients were equally divided
between those who were working two to six months later and those who were not. Those who
were working had an average income of$170 per week, with 43% working only part-time. Forty
percent of all the families terminated experienced an increase in monthly income, while 49%
experienced a decline. According to the study, there was "little systematic evidence of extreme
deprivation during the period of no cash benefits." The percentage of those living in emergency
shelters remained at 1-2%. Other than food pantries, families did not tend to seek help from
community organizations. Families did report a much greater reliance on friends and extended
family members. The report notes, however, that Iowa limited its period of no benefits to six
months, whereas a system that cuts people off benefits pennanently might see family support
decline over time and welfare recipients more likely to go to shelters or seek other private help.

       4. Crime -- New FBI Statistics: The FBI will release on Sunday preliminary data on
crimes reported in 1996. The data show that the number of serious crimes reported in the U.S. is
down 3% since 1995 -- the fifth annual decline in a row. The data indicate that this year's
decline was fueled by a 7% drop in the number of violent crimes -- including an 11 % drop in the
number of murders.



                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

                                                                                                           3

                5. Education -- Vocational Education Reauthorization: The Department of Education
       will transmit to Congress early next week the Perkins Career Preparation Education Act, which
       would restructure the Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. The proposed
       legislation generally aims to promote a stronger academic component in voc-ed programs,
       thereby bringing vocational education into line with broad standards-based school refonn. The
       legislation also would consolidate 23 existing voc-ed programs into three: a formula grant to
       states, Tech-Prep education, and a discretionary grant program allowing the Department of
       Education to fund a wide variety of activities. The proposed grant to states would provide them
       with enhanced flexibility, removing a number of set-asides that now require states to fund
       programs for groups such as displaced homemakers and criminal offenders. The bill also
       establishes new accountability provisions and a system of performance goals and indicators. We
       expect the House Education and Workforce Committee to adopt much of the Administration's
       proposal in its bill, though it may well resist our efforts (more symbolic than anything else) to
       make explicit links between the programs in this bill and our School-to-Work Program.

               6. Education -- Multilingual School Districts: You have said on a number of occasions
      that the nation has four school districts in which students speak over 100 foreign languages as
      first languages. We asked the Department of Education to verify this number and identify the
      specific school districts. According to the Department, there are now five school districts with
      over 100 languages and one with just under 100 languages. The five school districts are: New
      York City (140 languages), Prince George's County MD (128), Montgomery County MD (119),
      District of Columbia (116), and Fairfax County VA (over 100). In addition, Chicago enrolls
      students speaking 96 different languages.

                 7. Immigration Study: A recent study released by the National Research Council and
        funded by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform found that immigration increases the
        nation's total economic output by about $10 billion each year and has little negative effect on the
        income or job opportunities of most native-born Americans. The study finds, however, that
        immigration has contributed to a 5% decrease in the wages of native high school dropouts since
        1980. (For the most part, African Americans have escaped the burden on low-paid native
        workers because they do not generally live in pockets of heavy immigration.) In addition, the
      . study finds that in communities and states with high concentrations of low-skilled, low-paid
        immigrants, taxpayers incur a burden: for example, the study estimates that because the average
        immigrant family in California collects about $3,000 more in public services (including
        education) than it pays in taxes each year, native households in the State pay an average of about
        $1,000 in taxes to provide services to immigrants. The study made no policy recommendations,
        but its findings could support efforts to give greater preferences to more highly educated or
        skilled immigrants.
