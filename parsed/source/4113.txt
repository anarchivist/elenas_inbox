TEXT:
We should get together sometime Monday to discuss how to proceed in the
days ahead, on communications and legislative strategy. In this vein, >Bob
Litt of DOJ called me over the weekend to discuss whether we should (a)
release the Reno/McCaffrey letter, (b) do a press release, or (c) try to
operate below the radar screen. He also raised trying to do a deal with
Abraham -- his support on this issue in exchange for our agreement to
nominate someone ~ whom he wants on the Sentencing Commission .
