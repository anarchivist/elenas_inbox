ah.   I was wondering   how come you were able to write emails but not pick up the
phone! what's up on     florida? Anna durand just told me she thought all was
resolved -- that HHS    would find their plan complete (by not looking behind the
certification on the    45-day comment period), and would do so as of Oct 1.  Is
this what you hear?
