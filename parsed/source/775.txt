For the Tuesday press conference (with Chretien) we are putting domestic
Q&A in the briefing book alongside the foreign policy Q&A.

Please e-mail me the top Q&A on your issues by noon on Monday, at the
latest (Staff Secretary asked to have them by 2pm, and Mike wants to
review them first ... ).

Thanks.    Please call me with questions x62712.
