Minyon and Ben--In further discussions with Elena, it is clear that our
calls to various folks that need heads up must be carefully timed.  The
Commission sends its report and recommendations to Congress with courtesy
copy to us. We should call folks tomorrow am and alert them that the
report has been sent to the Hill and use that fact as a way of talking
about this.  Elena will make sure we have talking points and the
President's statement to guide our conversations.  Thanks.
