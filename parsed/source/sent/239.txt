MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS

FROM:            BRUCE REED
                 Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

                 ELENA KAGAN
                 Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:         Formation of Interagency Working Group on Early Childhood Development


        As the President announced in his State of the Union Address, he and the First Lady will
hold a White House Conference on Early Learning and the Brain this Spring. In conjunction
with this Conference, and in light of recent scientific research on neurological development, the
Administration will engage in a broad-based review of policy affecting our youngest children.
As this review goes forward, the Administration will highlight ongoing and new initiatives to
support these children and their families.

        To initiate this effort, the President will issue an executive memorandum asking each
agency to identify policies and proposals to enhance early childhood development. This
memorandum also will call for the formation of a senior level interagency working group to
share, examine, and develop these plans. Attached is a draft of this memorandum.

         We will hold the first meeting of this working group on Friday, February 14, from 1:30-
2:30 p.m. in Room 180 of the Old Executive Office Building [check availability]. We would
like you to designate a Presidential appointee to join this working group and attend this meeting.
 Because the President wishes to issue the executive memorandum shortly after this meeting,
your designee should provide any comments you have on the memorandum before or at the
meeting. In addition, designees should bring with them a list of the three to five programs or
initiatives relating to early childhood development that your agency, at this early stage in the
process, would most like to highlight. Given the Administration's commitment to a balanced
budget and fiscal discipline, each agency should indicate the level of new funding, if any, these
initiatives would require.

       Please feel free to contact either of us with any questions.
