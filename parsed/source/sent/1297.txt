TEXT:
What Elaine says about the comparison between Haskins' approach and ours
is very interesting. You should let Emily know.   We haven't said much
recently about the flexibility governors may have under our approach.  At
least in our private conversations we shouldn't forget this line.

That language in the ed/workforce bill is extraordinary.  It takes what
that judge did in NY (requiring prevailing wage for workfare participants)
and goes yet one step further.
