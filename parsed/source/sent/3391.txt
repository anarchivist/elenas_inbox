PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
         The President is today issuing two directives that will
mitigate the harshest effects of the welfare bill on legal aliens
and their children.
        The first directs the Secretary of Agriculture to grant a
waiver allowing any state, subject to certain legal restrictions,
to extend the certification periods -- the time elapsing between
certifications of eligibility for food stamps -- applicable to
legal aliens receiving assistance.    This directive will allow
states to continue providing food stamp benefits to legal aliens
and their children; this is because, under the terms of the law,
benefits to such individuals are cut off only at the time of
recertification of their eligibility for food stamps. When a
state extends the certification period, it pushes back the date
on which a legal alien will be deprived of food stamp benefits.
        Extension of the certification period will allow those who
have applied for citizenship to continue to receive food stamps
while the INS reviews their applications. More generally, the
extension will give states time to develop the procedures needed
to make accurate determinations of the many facts -- such as
immigration classification, veteran status, or work history --
that the new law makes relevant to eligibility.    In this way, the
directive will decrease inaccurate or inequitable decisions to
cut off food stamp benefits.
        This waiver, however, has limits. Under current law, the
Secretary cannot allow states to extend certification periods
beyond one year for most aliens or two years for certain elderly
or disabled aliens.    Neither can the Department allow states to
extend any recertification beyond August 22, 1997.
        The second directive instructs the Attorney General and
other heads of agencies to make continued efforts to remove
bureaucratic obstacles to naturalization. The INS already has
made great progress in this area, devoting more resources to
processing naturalization applications and reducing long waiting
lists. This directive instructs the Attorney General to continue
to increase staff used to review citizenship applications and to
develop novel and effective means, including joint efforts with
community groups, of assisting applicants for naturalization.     In
addition, the directive instructs the heads of all relevant
agencies to develop public/private partnerships devoted to
providing English
o

    -language training to applicants; make outreach
    efforts to potential applicants; and provide special assistance
    to refugees and asylees. .
