TEXT:
I just learned that the President will be meeting with the FOP Board for a
20-minute meeting sometime on Monday.  The subject of Uniformed Division
unionization may well come up.  I will be sure to check all briefing materials
to ensure that the President has the information he needs.  I've been told that
if, in addition, you would like to attend the meeting, you would be more than
welcome.
