           Federal Judge William Osteen has indicated he will not issue a decision on FDA's tobacco rule
           before April 14, but we expect him to issue his decision that day or shortly thereafter. Three
           general outcomes are possible: 1) the court upholds the rule; 2) the court rules that FDA has
           jurisdiction, but that portions or all of the rule are invalid (still a major victory); or 3) the court
           rules against FDA jurisdiction and the rule. We have worked with HHS, DoJ and other WH
           offices to prepare statements for each of these scenarios so you and others will be able to respond
           quickly to the decision. The Justice Department will review the decision immediately. If the
           court decision is made available in the morning and is not completely favorable, we expect to be
           prepared to announce later that same day the Administration's intent to appeal. Weare also
           working with the departments to prepare new policies you could announce within days or weeks
           after the decision to ensure further progress on tobacco as the FDA rule moves through the
           appeals process.

life of a woman or avert serious harm to her health. Considerable medical uncertainty surrounds
this question. The doctors of the women you met with believed the procedure was necessary to
prevent serious injury, and other doctors have said that the procedure, in certain circumstances, is
or may be the safest one to use. Still other doctors have disputed that health considerations ever
demand use of the procedure.

         Perhaps the most reliable opinion is from the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynceologists CACOG), which issued a statement in January addressing the procedure. CACOG,.
like most other medical groups, calls the procedure an intact dilatation and extraction or intact
D&X.) According to the statement, "A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no
circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life or preserve
the health of the woman." (Emphasis in original.) The statement then went on: "An intact D&X,
however, may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the
life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient,
based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision." In sum, doctors have
other options, but those other options may be more risky or otherwise more undesirable from a
medical standpoint.

        Other groups of doctors, with a greater stake in the abortion controversy, have taken more
definitive positions. The Society ofPhysicials for Reproductive Choice and Health issued a
statement last month saying that "in complex obstetrical situations, dilatation and extraction is
the safest procedure to use. It carries the least risk of bleeding, perforation, infection or trauma to
the birth canal." On the other hand, a group of mostly pro-life physicians called PHACT has
written that "there are absolutely no obstetrical situations requiring the destruction of a partially
delivered fetus," and indeed that the procedure involves serious risks of matemal hemorrhage,
uterine rupture, and infection.

        A recent article in the New York Times noted that the partial-birth procedure is only one
of three procedures (all of them "pretty gruesome," as one doctor quoted in the article said) that
can be used to end pregnancies after 20 weeks. The article reported that three of the twelve
abortion specialists interviewed generally prefer the procedure on the ground that it poses less
risk of uterine perforation. The article also noted that one doctor who does not usually use the
procedure has done so on particular occasions because "the woman's anatomy or the fetus's size
demanded it."

        Given the state of medical evidence on this subject, you can and should continue to
demand that any legislation contain an exception for women who need the procedure to prevent
serious harm. Such an exception would enable the attending doctor -- surely the person with the
most relevant knowledge -- to make the complex decision whether the procedure is in fact
medically necessary in a given set of circumstances. The uncertainties surrounding this issue,
however, caution against your making any estimates of the number of women whose health,
without this procedure, would be at risk of serious harm. Any such estimates would be difficult
to support.
