TEXT:
1. ' Could you go to the meetings Carol mentioned in her e-mail to us and
report back if anything interesting happens? Thanks.

2.  I believe Bruce is going to have a       discussion with the First Lady on
dates for the 0-3 Conference. There's        some thinking that it should be
later than originally planned.  I have       your scheduling requests, which
look great -- except that we are still       indefinite on the timing.  Let's
wait for a bit more guidance before we       turn them in.
