     Our brief expressed doubt over whether California had implemented the
     state option in a constitutional way, but said the district court needed
     to do more fact finding. Our brief also argued that the federal statute
     providing the option is constitutional, i.e, it can be implemented in a
     constitutional way.

     I'm getting the opinion now, but I understand that it rules that the
     California law is unconstitional, without further fact-finding.  The court
     did not comment on the constutionality of the federal law (which was not
     before the court) but it's language indicates that there court finds many
     constitutional hurdles.

     Elena and I agree we should defer to Justice. As a practical matter,
     states considering such policies will need to review the court's guidance
     as they go forward.

     Have I got this wrong?   Didn't the court agree with DOJ in this case?
