TEXT:
and another thing.   this memo reminded me that I've meant to remind you
 (but I do feel rather a pest in doing so) that you should cc me when you
respond to e-mails from staff: they ask you questions about work etc., and
I have no idea what your answers are.   It's just another 10 letters (or
can you do it in 5?). Thanks.
