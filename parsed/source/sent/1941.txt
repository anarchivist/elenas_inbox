          MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

          FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                                   Larry Stein
                                   Elena Kagan

          SUBJECT:                 Tobacco Legislative Strategy

                   We have met in recent weeks with Erskine, OYP, HHS, OMB, NEC and Counsel's
          Office to review our legislative strategy on tobacco. This memo lays out a consensus approach.
          In brief, we will use the next six weeks to lay the groundwork for a possible summit by (1)
          attacking Republican plans to enact piecemeal legislation; (2) praising comprehensive bills that
          meet your principles, particularly Senator Conrad's; and (3) holding meetings with the
          Democratic Caucus and quiet conversations (led by Erskine) with key Republicans in both the
          House and Senate. At the end of this time, we will evaluate whether to call a bipartisan summit
          to negotiate comprehensive tobacco legislation.

          Background

                   As you know, prospects for passing comprehensive tobacco legislation this year are
          uncertain. The major obstacles are (I) the complexity and scope of such legislation and the sheer
          number of egos and committees involved, and (2) the special difficulty of reaching agreement on
          liability limits, which many Members see as necessary, but few will vocally support.

                   Republicans appear to be divided into three camps. Some Republicans, especially in the
          Senate (~, Hatch, McCain, Hyde, and probably Lott), want to pass comprehensive legislation
          modeled on the June 20 settlement. Others (~, Gingrich, Kasich) are leaning toward a simple
          excise tax increase, with the proceeds funding an income tax cut. Still a third -- and growing --
          group (~, Nickles, Anney, Delay) supports a bill without any significant price increase,
          ostensibly aimed at youth smoking (through provisions on access, marketing, etc.), but unlikely
          to accomplish any of your objectives. The difficulty of the liability issue cuts against the first
          group and plays into the hands of the second and third. In particular, the proponents of a money-
          free bill hop'e that by allying themselves with liberal Democrats on liability limits, they can
          effectively curtail tobacco legislation.

                 Many, if not most, Democrats will coalesce around a bill that Sen. Conrad intends to
          introduce within the next week. (Rep. Fazio will probably introduce a companion bill in the
          House.) This bill will meet your five principles for tobacco legislation. It will have a large price
          increase (though the allocation of the proceeds is only partly consistent with our budget); a strong



                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

section on FDA jurisdiction; good marketing and access provisions, etc. It will not include any
liability limits (except that it will allow states to settle their tobacco suits for a share of the
money). The Democrats most likely not to sign on to this bill will be those from tobacco states.

         So far, no bipartisan bill has emerged in either chamber. Senators Harkin and Chafee are
working on a comprehensive bill with some liability limits, but they still have much work to do;
in addition, it is questionable whether these two Senators (whatever the merits of their bill) can
attract significant support. Reps. Bliley and Waxman have had some discussions about a
comprehensive bill, but the two remain very far apart on many critical issues.

Recommcndation

        Our recommended strategy is to use the next six weeks to place pressure on Republicans
to negotiate on a comprehensive bill, while conveying to them the genuineness of our desire to
enact such legislation. At the end of six weeks, if the legislative process remains bogged down,
we will call Republican and Democratic leaders to a budget-like summit process.

         1. Attack Republican plans to enact piecemeal legislation. We will enlist other
Democrats and the public health community in strenuously opposing Republican plans to enact
piecemeal legislation. Through events, statements, and testimony, we will demonstrate the need
for comprehensive legislation -- involving, most notably, substantial price increases -- to reduce
youth smoking. We will make the case that the proposed Republican approach of enacting a
"youth" bill without substantial price increases has no hope of achieving our objectives. In our
first salvos on this subject next week, the Vice President may take part in an event with Koop
and Kessler, and you can announce new estimates of the effect of comprehensive legislation on
youth smoking.

        2. Support comprehensive legislation, especially Sen. Conrad's bill. We expect Sen.
Conrad to introduce his bill next week, and we believe you should greet it warmly. You should
make the point that it is a comprehensive bill consistent with each of your five principles. At the
same time, you should stress the importance of bipartisanship on this issue and encourage others
to come forward with comprehensive legislation. This invitation should ensure that your support
for Conrad's bill does not polarize the issue along partisan lines. Ifadditional comprehensive
bills meeting your principles emerge -- especially of a bipartisan nature -- you should express
support for them as well.

       3. Talk to Democratic caucuses and key Republicans. Erskine, Donna, Larry, and Bruce
will talk to the Democratic Caucus in both the House and the Senate to assure them that we will
insist on tough legislation -- that we will not compromise too much or too early. At the same
time, Erskine will begin quiet conversations with key Republicans to persuade them that we are
serious about enacting legislation -- that we do not intend to use tobacco as a political issue.

       4. Keep liability limits on the table, without supporting them. To maintain our ability to



                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

work out a compromise, we will try to keep liability limits on the table, without ourselves
supporting them. Our consistent line -- we have used it for the last six months -- is that (1) we
would prefer a comprehensive bill without any liability limits, but that (2) if we get everything
we want -- if we get a comprehensive bill that satisfies each of the President's five principles --
then reasonable limits on liability "would not be a dealbreaker."

       Justice Department testimony to this effect caused consternation among some Democrats
this week; they argued that we should not yet (or, perhaps, ever) indicate a willingness to
compromise on this issue. We disagree; we think that in order to preserve our ability to craft a
comprehensive bill that can pass the Congress, we must prevent liberal Democrats and
conservative Republicans from joining to make liability limits unacceptable. In the main,
however, we will try not to talk about the liability issue. We will make the point that it is a
sideshow and that the real battle is between comprehensive and piecemeal legislation.

         5. Call a summit, if still appropriate. We believe that we may well have to call a budget-
like summit to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation. A summit will remove complications
arising from multiple committee jurisdiction and provide cover for all parties on difficult issues
like liability. The steps described above will lay the groundwork for a summit, by placing
intense pressure on the Republicans to agree to comprehensive tobacco legislation, while
convincing them that we will not play politics with the issue. It is of course possible that no
summit will be necessary -- that these steps will get the legislative process rolling without any
special intervention. We will continually reassess this issue, but place ourselves in position to
hold a summit in about six weeks.
