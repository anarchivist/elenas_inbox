TEXT:
1. Tomorrow's 8:30 meeting with Erskine will cover our 3-page mission
memos, the 0-3 conference, and the service summit.
2. Don griped about·the CNS and our service plans generally and called
for a meeting, which Sylvia said she would put together.  Haven't you
missed him these past few days? By the by, he told me that the job he
really wants is Harris Wofford's.
3. Sylvia asked how Gov. Wilson would respond to our education event.
Not really knowing the answer to this question, I said that he wasn't
likely to embrace it with open arms.  She asked whether he would blast
us. I sort of shrugged.   What is the answer?
