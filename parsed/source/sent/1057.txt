Cathy:

Sylvia Mathews had called re: a meeting that she wanted to set up between
Eunice Shriver, Sylvia & Frank Raines re: SSI kids.  The date for the
meeting, one of the only that Eunice is available for which Sylvia is
making work on her calendar as well, is scheduled for THURSDAY, MAY 29 @
11:00am in Sylvia's office.

Ken thinks that Bruce should attend - and might want to include Diana -
but Bruce b/c of the level.

Please let me know if Bruce will attend.     If there are any questions,
Bruce should call Ken.
thanks.
