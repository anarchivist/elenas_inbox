             MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME AND AT WORK
                                May 23, 1999

Today, in a commencement speech at Grambling State University, President Clinton announced
new steps to help workers meet their responsibilities to their jobs, and their more important
responsibilities to their families. The President put forward two new proposals to make leave
more affordable for American workers. In addition, he released a new report that examines the
"time crunch" that parents increasingly feel as they struggle to balance their responsibilities at
home and at work.

Working to Make Parental Leave More Affordable. A 1996 study by the Commission on
Family and Medical Leave found that loss of wages was the most significant barrier to parents
taking advantage of unpaid leave following the birth or adoption ofa child. Today, President
Clinton directed the Secretary of Labor to propose new regulations and model state legislation to
enable states to develop innovative ways of using the Unemployment Insurance (VI) system to
support parents taking leave to care for a newborn or adopted child. Several States recently have
asked the Administration whether they could use the Ul system for this purpose consistent with
federal law. The new regulations will authorize this expansion of the Ul system, thereby
allowing states that wish to use unemployment insurance to assist new parents to put their plans
into effect.

Enabling Federal Workers to Take Paid Leave to Care for Sick Family Members. In an
effort to set an example for all employers, President Clinton also today directed the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) to revise its government-wide regulations to allow federal
employees to use up to 12 weeks of accrued sick leave each year to care for a spouse, son,
daughter, or parent with a "serious health condition," as that term is defined for the purpose of
applying the Family and Medical Leave Act. Currently, the amount of sick leave that can be used
to care for a family member who is ill is limited to 13 days each year for most federal employees.
By enabling federal workers to use more ofthe sick leave they have earned, according to
conditions established by the FMLA, this measure will remove a significant barrier to caring for
an ill family member. The President also has directed the OPM to establish an Interagency
Family Friendly Workplace Working Group to develop, promote, and evaluate federal family-
friendly workplace initiatives. The President previously has taken other actions to ensure that
federal government is a model employer, including: allowing federal employees to donate annual
leave to other employees; expanding flexible family-friendly work arrangements, such as job
sharing, career part-time employment, alternative work schedules, telecommuting, and satellite
work locations; and directing improvements in the quality offederally sponsored child care.

A New Study on the Amount of Time Available for Families. The President released a report
by his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) today that details the factors that have led to
decreased amounts of time available for parents to spend with their children. The report,
Families and the Labor Market, 1969-1999: Analyzing the "Time Crunch," demonstrates that
the increase in hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with the shift toward single-parent
families, has resulted in families experiencing an average decrease of22 hours a week (14

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion




     percent) in time that parents spend with their children. The report concludes that the increased
     time at work among parents requires policy-makers to seek new ways to promot~ strong families,
     including greater flexibility in paid work hours, more affordable child care, better support for
     families with low-wage earning parents, and methods for encouraging two-parent families to
     form and stay together.

     Advancing An Agenda To Help Parents Balance Their Responsibilities At Home And At
     Work. In his balanced budget request, the President put forward a bold agenda to provide
     families with greater tools to meet their responsibilities at home and at work. This agenda
     includes: an historic initiative to make child care better, safer, and more affordable for working
     families; a tripling of our investment in after-school programs through the 21 sl Century
     Community Learning Center program; a new tax credit to help Americans struggling with long-
     term care costs; and proposals to expand the Family and Medical Leave law to cover more
     workers and allow leave for more parental activities, including parent-teacher conferences and
     routine doctor's visits.
