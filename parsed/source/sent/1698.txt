TEXT:
Doug Melamed from the antitrust division at DOJ (Klein's chief deputy)
called me this afternoon.  He has heard that the FTC is speaking with
folks on the Hill about the proper scope of an antitrust exemption, and he
wants to participate in those discussions.  I wish FTC weren't having
these discussions now, but I guess we can't do anything about that.   what
do you think we should tall melamed?
