        The Supreme Court yesterday declined to review the first
constitutional challenge to the "don't ask, don't tell" policy to
reach the Court. The Court's action, taken without comment, left
standing the decision of the en banc Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit sustaining the discharge of a Navy pilot.  The
pilot, Paul Thomasson, had sent letters to four admirals
announcing "I am gay." After receiving an honorable discharge,
Thomasson brought suit, principally under the First Amendment,
challenging the part of the policy establishing a rebuttable
presumption that a person who makes such statements has engaged
or will engage in homosexual acts. Thomasson did not challenge
the part of the policy making a service member who has engaged in
homosexual acts subject to discharge.  The Solicitor General's
Office filed a brief in the Supreme Court urging it to decline
review of Thomasson's case.
