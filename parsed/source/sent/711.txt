~,




              You have asked whether the so-called partial-birth procedure is ever necessary to save the
     life of a woman or avert serious harm to her health. Considerable medical uncertainty surrounds
     this question. The doctors of the women you met with believed the procedure was necessary for
     this reason, and other doctors agree that the procedure, in certain circumstances, is the safest one
     to use. Still other doctors dispute that health considerations ever demand use of the procedure.

              Perhaps the most reliable opinion is from the American College of Obstetricians and
     Gynceologists (ACOG), which issued a statement in January addressing the procedure, which it
     calls intact dilatation and extraction (intact D&X). According to the statement, "A select panel
     convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the
     only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman." (Emphasis in original.) The
     statement then went on: "An intact D&X, however, may be the best or most appropriate
     procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and
     only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular
     circumstances can make this decision." In sum, doctors have other options, but those other
     options may be more risky or otherwise more undesirable from a medical standpoil1t.

             Other groups of doctors, with a greater stake in the abortion controversy, have taken more
     definitive positions. The Society ofPhysicials for Reproductive Choice and Health issued a
     statement last month saying that "in complex obstetrical situations, dilatation and extraction is
     the safest procedure to use. It carries the least risk of bleeding, perforation, infection or trauma to
     the birth canal." On the other hand, a group of mostly pro-life physicians called PHACT has
     written that "there are absolutely no obstetrical situations requiring the destruction of a partially
     delivered fetus," and indeed that the procedure involves. serious risks of matemal hemorrhage,
     uterine rupture, and infection.

             Given the state of medical evidence on this subject, your longstanding position seems the
     appropriate one. That position would leave to doctors themselves the complex decision whether
     the procedure is medically necessary in a given set of circumstances. Allowing the medical
     community to make clearly medical decisions in this way is the only cert.ain way to protect the
     health of women.




                                                                            A,utomated Records Management System

     Bruce -- Thursday at 10:00 you are scheduled to attend a DPC principals
     meeting re: outreach strategy for NEXTEA.  I have met with DOT, HUD, DOL,
     HHS, NEC, and OMB staff about ways to promote the President's welfare to
     work transportation proposals. Here is a one page description of our
     proposal and some outreach ideas.

     1)   What do you think?

     2) NEC staff would like me to share this with them so they can show Gene
     before Thursday's meeting -- is that okay with you?

Welfare to Work Transportation Proposals

The Administration has proposed two welfare-to-work transportation initiatives:

·      NEXTEA includes a six-year, $600 million grant program to help states, localities, and
       non-profit organizations develop transportation services to help welfare recipients and
       other low income workers get to jobs.
·      The President's budget includes a $10 million expansion ofHUD's Bridges to Work
       demonstration project, which connects residents of five cities (Baltimore, Chicago,
       Denver, Milwaukee, and St. Louis) to suburban jobs and employment-related support
       services to help keep them in the workforce. The projects, developed by Philadelphia-
       based Public/Private Ventures, are supported by private foundations as well as HUD and
       are run by local public-private consortias.

There is at least one proposal in Congress:

·      Senator Specter, Santorum, and others plan to introduce a bill which would authorize
       $250 million a year for a "reverse commute pilot program" modeled after the
       Public/Private Ventures program.

Possible Outreach Activities/Events/Executive Actions

There are several types of activities we could consider:

·      Administration officials could conduct a briefing for groups concerned about welfare
       reform to inform them of the Administration's NEXTEA and budget proposals.         .

·      The President could hold a White House meeting to highlight the need for transportation
       assistance in the welfare-to-work effort. He could promote his proposal and possibly
       issue an executive order (suggested by a consortium of state transportation officials)
       which would require better coordination of existing federal human serVice transportation
       programs. Meeting invitees could include:
       ·       Business, nonprofit, and transportation executives involved in the Baltimore,
               Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, and St. Louis Bridges to Work program;
       ·       National labor and business leaders interested in transportation issues;
       ·       Bipartisan Congressional sponsors of welfare to work transportation initiatives
               (i.e., Senators Specter and Santorum);
       ·       Researchers from PubliclPrivate Ventures, who could possibly release a report on
               the Bridges to Work program. (The organization plans to release a report in the
               next month or so but since it examines only at the first six months of program
               operation, it is unlikely to contain news.)

·      The President or Administration officials could visit a transportation site in Baltimore,
       Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee, or St. Louis.       Automated Records Management System
