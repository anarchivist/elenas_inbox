fyi. in response to a note from me to sylvia saying that we should do
race policy in our weekly (rather than the race initiative weekly, as she
suggested) because race initiative materials are FOIAble.

I think a little something in their report would be helpful.

I just thought about the fact that they have your policy docs which could
be foiaed before announcements ... hmm.how big a problem do you think that
is?
