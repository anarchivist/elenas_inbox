TEXT:
1. On the length of the equal protection analysis, I still think we should go
,tlith the compromise I proposed.  But I wouldn't be terribly upset if someone
shortened that yet a little further.
2. On the "caste system" point, Steve has a good point.      (You'll remember that
I didn't defend this language; I just explained it -- and warned that DOJ might
well resist its removal.)    As noted before, I'd be perfectly content -- even
ple~sed -- to see this language go.
