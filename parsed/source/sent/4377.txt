Karen:

In talking about the Secret Service protest tomorrow at our staff meeting
today, we thought we should· probably do a Q&A for McCurry's brief
tomorrow, and that you'd be the best suited to the task. Any chance
you'll have a spare moment to do a few lines on this? If not, what
guidance do you suggest we give the press office on this planned protest?
I'm also going to check w/Rahm to see where he is on this.

Jose'
