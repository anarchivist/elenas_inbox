thanks and thanks.  we're supposedly getting a memo from OLC today, though
they're usually late.
I got a call from a VP of the NYSE yesterday.  They are running something in
their newsletter (which goes to all CEOs of NYSE companies) on where the
candidates stand on the California referendum.  She wanted to know whether we
had a written statement on the subject or even a transcript of oral remarks. Do
we? What do you think we should tell her?
