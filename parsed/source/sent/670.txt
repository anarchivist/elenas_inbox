RE:                     Two Upcoming CEA Reports

DATE:           Tuesday, March 18, 1997


        Michelle Jolin ofCEAjust told me about two upcoming CEA reports which may be
useful for March-April events. She is interested in any guidance on how and when to release
them (and is also discussing this with Bruce).

        1. Welfare Reform. By the week of 3/31, CEA will be ready with a report on the factors
that have reduced the nation's welfare caseloads so dramatically in the past four years. They will
conclude that about 50% was due to the strong economy, and 50% due to other factors, including
our state waivers (which may account for roughly one-third of the reduction). Apparently, the
President has already been told about this report and is very interested in it. It could serve as a
"What Works" guide for states (or literally be turned into such a guide). Since it will almost
definitely show that our approach is the right one, we may want to consider having the POTUS
highlight it through a Radio Address or other event.

        2. Investments in Children Aged 0-3. By the week of April 14th (right before the Early
Childhood Conference), CEA will be ready with a report on investments in children aged 0-3,
including health and mental health programslinvestments. It will essentially be a cost-benefit
analysis pointing out the importance and cost-effectiveness of investing in young children.
While it will not contain hard news, we could release or mention it as part of another event to
lead-in to the Conference.

        Please let me know if either of these are of interest.
