MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                   Bruce Reed
                        Gene Sperling
                        Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                New Initiatives on Discretionarv Side of Budget

         As you know, OMB is trying to find an additional $6 billion for discretionary spending.
Assuming this money becomes available, the DPC and NEC agree that we should fund the new
initiatives listed below in your FY 1999 budget. OMB has signed off on these recommendations.
 Some of the departments, however, may call for decreasing the amount of money spent on new
initiatives.

         We already have given you detailed memos on most of these initiatives. If you approve
the initiatives, you can announce any or all of them in the State of the Union.

        Because so many of the new initiatives involve education, we are attaching an appendix
to this memo that shows recommended funding levels for the Department of Education's major
base programs. In reviewing the education spending, you should note that we have just
discovered a calculation error whose correction will free up additional monies. We had thought
we would need a $434 million increase in the Pell Grant Program to raise the maximum award
from $3,000 to $3, 100. New cost estimates show we can finance these policies with $224
million, leaving $210 million for other spending. We are currently considering options to keep
these funds in the Pelt Grant Program to support a larger increase in the maximum award level or
to invest them in the After-School and Head Start components of the child care initiative.

Education

1. Education Opportunity Zones ($225 million): This initiative will provide funding to about
25 high-poverty urban and rural school districts for agreeing to adopt a "Chicago-type" school
reform agenda that includes ending social promotions, removing bad teachers, reconstituting
failing schools, and adopting district-wide choice.

2. College-School Partnerships ($150 million): This initiative, which builds on Eugene Lang's
model of helping disadvantaged youth, will provide funding for college-school partnerships
designed to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to students in high-poverty
schools, starting in the sixth grade and continuing through high school. The six-year funding
path will provide help to nearly 2 million students. The proposal also will include Chaka



                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Fattah's idea of early notification to disadvantaged 6th graders telling them of their Pell Grant
and loan eligibility.

3. Campaign on Access to Higher Education ($20 million): This initiative will fund an
intensive publicity campaign on the affordability of higher education. The goal of the campaign
will be to make every family aware that higher education is now universally accessible -- and that
it is the key to higher earnings.

4. Teacher Recruitment and Preparation ($67 million): This initiative, which you previewed
last July at the NAACP Conference, will provide scholarships to nearly 35,000 new teachers over
five years for committing to work in high-poverty urban and rural schools. It.also will upgrade
the quality of teacher preparation programs serving these communities.

5. Technology Teacher Training ($222 million): This initiative will dedicate 30 percent ($142
million) of the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (which is being increased from $425 to $475
million) to ensure that at least one teacher in every school receives intensive training in the use of
technology for education, so that those "master teachers" can train their colleagues. An
additional $80 million will begin an effort to train every new teacher in the latest technology.

6. Hispanic Education Action Plan -- ($195 million or more): This initiative will increase
funding for a number of existing programs to improve education for Hispanic Americans and
other limited English proficient (LEP) children and adults. It would double our investment in
training teachers to address the needs ofLEP children; boost the Migrant Education Program by
16 percent; increase the TRIO college preparation program by 10 percent; and create a 5-year,
$100 million effort to disseminate best practices in ESL training for adults. We would
accompany these program increases with administrative actions to help Hispanic students
complete high school and succeed in college.

Child Care

        We recommend placing most of the child care initiative -- in particular, the proposed
increase in the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the establishment of a new Early
Learning Fund -- on the mandatory side of the budget. The smaller pieces of the initiative that
we propose placing on the discretionary side are the following:

1. After-School Program Expansion ($100-200 million): This program expansion will
increase funding of the 21st Century Community Learning Center Program (now funded at $40
million) for before- and after-school programs for school-age children at public schools.
Depending on the exact funding level chosen, this investment will create new programs in 1,500-
4,000 schools, serving between 75,000 and 200.000 children.

2. Standards Enforcement Fund ($100 million): This new fund will support state efforts to
improve licensing systems and to enforce health and safety standards, particularly through



                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

unannounced inspections of child care settings. The fund also will enable states to issue report
cards, for use by consumers, on the quality of the facilities inspected.

3. Provider Training ($51-60 million): A new Child Care Provider Scholarship Fund, which
you proposed at the Child Care Conference to fund at $50 million annually, will support 50,000
scholarships each year to students working toward a child care credential. The students will
commit to remaining in the field for one year for each year of assistance received, and will earn
increased compensation or bonuses when they receive their credential. An additional $1-10
million will allow the Department of Labor to expand its Child Care Apprenticeship Training
Program, which funds providers combining work toward a degree with on-the-job practice.

4. Research and Evaluation Fund ($10-30 million): This new fund will provide grants for
research projects, establish a National Center on Child Care Statistics, and set up a national child
care hotline.

5. Head Start and Early Head Start Expansion ($284-334 million): This level of increased
investment in the overall Head Start budget should permit doubling the set-aside for Early Head
Start without reducing the resources available for children 3-5. The doubled set-aside would
enable more than 35,000 additional children to receive Early Head Start services in 2002.

Welfare, Housing, Urban

1. Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers ($283 million): This initiative will provide 50,000
new housing vouchers to help welfare recipients in public housing who need to move in order to
find employment. HUD will distribute these vouchers on a competitive basis to public housing
authorities working with local T ANF agencies and/or grantees of the new $3 billion welfare-to-
work program. (A separate proposal, for which no new funding is needed, would allow families
in public or assisted housing to use vouchers to buy a home; HUD expects this proposal to assist
some 25,000 people become homeowners over two years.)

2. Housing Portability/Choice ($20 million): In addition to the new welfare-to-work housing
vouchers discussed above, our proposed package on housing portability and choice expands
Regional Opportunity Counseling sites and takes administrative actions to eliminate obstacles to
portability in the Section 8 housing program.

3. "Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal ($30 million): This initiative will assist
families that always pay their rent on time to become homeowners. The Neighborhood
Reinvestment Corporation will provide downpayment assistance, interest rate buydowns, or
rehabilitation loans to approximately 10,000 families.

4. Homeownership Opportunity Fund ($11 million): This initiative will provide funds for
HUD to develop a loan guarantee program to allow state and local governments to leverage
current HOME funds with private-sector investments to fund large-scale, affordable housing



                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

developments in distressed communities.

5. Community Empowerment Fund ($400 million): This initiative establishes a public/private
fund ("Eddie Mac"), which will invest in inner-city businesses and create a secondary market for
economic development loans (like Fannie Mae).

6. Homeless Assistance ($341 million): This level of increased investment includes $177
million to help 32,000 homeless people receive Section 8 vouchers.

Labor and Workforce

1. Child Labor ($89 million): This initiative is anchored by a $30 million commitment -- up
from $3 million -- to the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). The
initiative also will include funding to improve Customs Service enforcement of U.S. law banning
the import of goods made with forced or bonded child labor ($3 million) and to double the
Department of Labor's enforcement of child labor laws in the agricultural sector ($4 million).
Finally, the initiative will provide additional funding to the Migrant Education Program so it can
reach 50,000 more migrant children ($50 million). We are developing non-budget items to fill
out the package.

2. Community Adjustment ($50 million): This initiative will fund the creation of the Office of
Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA), which we proposed as part ofthe Fast Track
debate. As you know, this office will be modeled after the Defense Department's Office of
Economic Adjustment -- the Administration's first point of contact with communities
experiencing a military base closure or defense plant closing. We expect the Office to help
35-40 communities in its first year of operation. The initiative also will fund a variety of
other efforts to assist communities that face sudden and severe economic dislocation.

Health

1. 21st Century Trust Fund ($1 billion): This initiative will provide substantial additional
funding to NIH ($750 million) and NSC ($250 million), ramping up substantially over time, for
research activities -- particularly on the treatment and cure of diseases. We will provide you with
a separate memo on this initiative in the next day or two. Funding for this initiative will come
from comprehensive tobacco legislation.

2. AIDS Programs Expansion ($165 million): A funding increase for the Ryan White Program
of about 15 percent will go principally toward ADAP, to ensure that new and effective treatments
of AIDS reach those who need them. Some of the funds will support education and prevention
programs operated by states, cities, and community health centers, as well as by the CDC.

3. Racial Disparities in Health Care ($80 million): This initiative will address racial
disparities in six areas of health care: infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer, heart disease



                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion'




                                                                                                           5

     and stroke, diabetes, AIDS, and immunization. The proposal includes additional funding ($50
     million) to established public health programs to adapt and apply their prevention and education
     strategies to eliminate racial disparities. It also includes funding ($30 million) for thirty local
     pilot projects to test innovative approaches to reach this goal.

     Crime

     1. Community Prosecutors ($50 million): This initiative will provide grants to prosecutors for
     innovative, community-based prosecution efforts, such as Eric Holder adopted in the District of
     Columbia. A full 80 percent of the grants will go to pay the salaries and training costs associated
     with hiring or reassigning prosecutors to work directly with community residents.



     A number of the above proposals -- ~, education opportunity zones, university-school
     partnerships, housing vouchers -- can be presented as part of the race initiative, because they
     target predominantly minority areas or provide disproportionate benefits to members of minority
     groups. Other proposals described above -- the Hispanic dropout plan and the race and health
     initiative -- have obvious and explicit race connections. In addition:

     1. Civil Rights Enforcement ($68 million): This initiative will fund reforms to the EEOC and
     the civil rights offices at DOJ, HUD, HHS, Education, and DOL. Most important, additional
     funding of$37 million will allow the EEOC to expand its mediation program (allowing more
     than 70 percent of all complainants to choose mediation by the year 2000), increase the average
     speed of resolving complaints (from over nine months to six) and reduce the EEOC's current
     backlog (from 64,000 cases to 28,000). The initiative also will fund a dramatic expansion of
     HUD's civil rights enforcement office (in the 30th anniversary year of the Fair Housing Act) and
     improve coordination among the government's civil rights offices. We are preparing a number
     of non-budgetary administrative actions, especially involving fair housing and lending, to
     accompany our budget proposals in this area.

                                                                                                         6

         Appendix -- Education Base Programs

         Education testing: $16 million. The full amount needed to maintain progress on test
         development.

         Pell Grants: $7,779 million. A $224 million increase to maintain higher independent student
         eligibility and to raise the maximum award from $3,000 to $3,100.

         America Reads, $260 million. We did not get our America Reads bill in FY 1998. We did
         obtain increases for tutoring in the Corporation for National and Community Service. Congress
         did, however, "advance appropriate" $210 million for FY 1999 for Education, contingent upon
         enactment of new law. The increase to $260 million reflects our original first year plan.

         Education Technology: $659 million. A $75 million increase over FY 1998 to continue support
         for school investments and development of new software and teaching techniques.

         Title 1, Education for the Disadvantaged, Grants to LEAs: $ 7,725 million. A $350 million
         increase over FY 1998 to serve an additional 400,000 children in poor communities.

         Goals 2000: $510 million. A $10 million increase over FY 1998, to maintain momentum in the
         States for school reform.

         Comprehensive School Reform: $175 million. A $30 million increase over FY 1998 for
         demonstrations of school reform models.

         Adult Education: $394 million. A $33 million increase over FY 1998 for basic education and
         English language training for the disadvantaged, immigrants, and welfare recipients.

         Special Education: $4,811 million. Same as the FY 1998 level, which was increased by $775
         million over FY 1997. States can spend the increase over 2 years. Secretary Riley has expressed
         concern about the lack of an FY 1999 increase. We are convinced that no increase will satisfy
         the advocates, and would prefer to negotiate this level in Congress, rather than use up scarce
         funds in your budget now.

         College Work-Studv, $915 million. An $85 milIion increase over FY 1998, make progress
         toward your goal of 1 million Work-Study positions by FY 2000.

         Reductions in the Base

         A number of programs have been reduced to make room for initiatives and major base programs,
         including: Impact Aid (-$92 milIion), the Education Block Grant (-$350 milIion), and Perkins
         Loans (-$85 milIion). Each of these has a vocal constituency. We believe we can make the case
         that our funding of initiatives and base programs are all higher priority than these programs.
