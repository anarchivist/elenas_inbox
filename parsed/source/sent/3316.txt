TEXT:
I had a long talk with Jennifer O'Connor today regarding where we were on
timber. A few things came up that I didn't know or had forgotten the answers
to. Specifically:
1.  Is the very brief Jack Ward Thomas letter you sent me our only response to
the liability letter? Why did we decide not to send the Lyons letter? Are we
sending anything else?
2. What did we ever manage to do re the First and the Last sales.    I can't
believe I've forgotten this, but I think I have.   My best recollection is that
we provided alternative timber that wasn't all that much better than the
original? Am I right?
3. What's going on on salvage? Jennifer showed me a letter from Ed Begley Jr
complaining vehemently about the salvage program and urging its suspension; and
also a cover memo from Katie to Leon(?) reacting sympathetically. Are we
planning anything on this front?
Many, many thanks.   You probably want to know about the brief.  I know I've said
this a lot of times by now, but I promise . . . tomorrow .
