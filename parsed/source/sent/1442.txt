TEXT:
I'm passing on a message from Cheryl Mills (who was passing on a message
from a friend) on a House provision to make tuition waivers taxable. This
does seem as if it would have a significant -- and undesirable -- effect
on American graduate schoool education. Have we taken a position on
this? Are we doing anything about it?

Are taxes in your area? If not, tell me who to send this to.   If so
skip down to the bottom message.

       >Background:
       >
       >As you may know, the "Tax Relief Act" of 1997, passed the U.S.
       >House of Representatives (H.R. 2014) on Thursday, June 26; a
       >different version of the bill passed the Senate (S. 949) on
       >Friday, June 27.  The House bill, while providing $135 billion
       >in tax relief to many Americans, contains a provision which
       >drastically and detrimentally affects graduate students.   A
       >short clause phases out section 117(d) of the tax code, the
       >section that excludes the value of tuition waivers or tuition
       >reductions from taxable income. With the loss o~ this tuition
       >tax exclusion, many graduate students will see their taxes
       >raised by thousands of dollars per year.  Examples provided by
       >the NAGPS (National Association of Graduate-Professional
       >Students) indicate that some of us may see our after-tax wages
       >cut by 50% or even more!!
       >
       >Tuition waivers are used in many graduate programs to assist
       >students during their often-lengthy education. Most of these
       >students are obtaining PhDs in academic fields and will go on
       >to modestly-paying university positions, possibly after long
       >post-doctoral research.  They serve as teaching assistants or
       >research assistants in return for not paying tuition, which can
       >easily exceed $20,000 per year at private institutions.  Under
       >the House version of the bill, the value of this tuition waiver
       >would be considered taxable income.
       >
       >Although the House version of this bill is a disaster for
       >graduate students, the Senate version does not include the
       >repeal of section 117(d) of the tax code.  Because of this
       >and many other differences in the House and Senate versions
       >of the bill, both houses of Congress (as well as the White
       >House) will convene to reconcile the two versions of the bill
       >following the July 4th recess.   At that point, the bill will
       >be voted on for final passage, and signed into law. Our last
       >chance to defeat the House bill is through this House-Senate
       >Committee, which is expected to begin meeting the week of
       >July 7th.
       >
       >If you have not heard of this issue, contained within the
       >highly publicized "Tax Relief Act," it is because this act is
       >enormous, containing tax issues involving cigarettes,
       >capital gains, and the $500 per child tax credit, to name just
       >a few.  It is these other issues which have gained the media's
       >attention, and few people seem to be aware of the impending
       >disaster for graduate students, higher education, and
       >university and research budgets.   **It is our responsibility
       >to ensure that our opinions are voiced and that this issue
       >gains national attention.**

>3.           Call (or fax or email) your Senators and Representative!

>4.           Make a special effort to swamp the members of the Conference

>What to say in your calls and letters:
>
>Please be polite and courteous, but let them know that you oppose
>the loss of section 117(d), the tuition tax waiver for graduate
>students. This waiver is retained in the Senate version (S. 949)

>(H.R. 2014). Be sure to mention that you are concerned that this
