Subject:         Child Seats Events

I have just heard that they no longer have time to do a full event on
Tuesday, Feb. 9, and the President will just be doing a departure
statement on the way to Wintergreen.  I am trying to find out if we can
have another date that week for this event.  I'll let everyone know as
soon as I can.
