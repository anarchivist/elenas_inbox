TEXT:
And another thought:  We could stress that this directive is needed in order to
allow states the time to devise fair and accurate ways of making the
determinations required by the bill.  The bill does allow certain legal aliens
to receive food stamps -- for example, if they're veterans or if theY're
permanent resident aliens who have worked for 40 quarters.  Right now, the
states don't have ways of checking such information and making eligibility
determinations on that basis.  So when Mr. X comes up for certification
tomorrow, the state may well make a mistake in determining his eligibility.
This directive will go some way toward giving states the time they need to set
up verification procedures that will ensure accurate eligibility determinations.
