MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 DPC Weekly Report

        1. Child Care -- Response to Announcement: We are pleased with the response so far
to your child care initiative. Children's advocates and child care experts are overjoyed at both
the level offunding and the composition of the package (~, the ratio of subsidies to tax cuts).
Hill Democrats and some moderate Republicans are enthusiastic about the package, as you heard
at Thursday's congressional meeting. Governors -- including a few Republicans -- have praised
the extent of state flexibility in the plan. Even conservative Republicans in Congress had a hard
time attacking your proposal. Rep. Pryce, whom Speaker Gingrich asked to respond to the
proposal for the House Republican leadership, admitted that you had "resisted the urge to have
the federal government control child care." Some Republicans alternated between accusing you
of spending too much money and claiming that they had spent even more for child care in the
past.

         The most serious criticism, which we knew we would face, is that the package does little
to help parents who want to stay at home to care for their children. (A similar point was made in
the opinion piece by David Blankenhorn appearing in the New York Time that you asked us
about; as you recall, he criticizes tax cuts for child care and supports expanding the child tax
credit to help parents of young children stay at home.) As you know, we can blunt this charge
somewhat by coming out for an expansion of the FMLA in the State of the Union to allow more
workers to stay at home for longer periods with their newborns. We are also open to discussing
with members of Congress an expansion of the child tax credit, although we found such
proposals too expensive to incorporate into our package. Most important, we cannot let anyone
forget your record of providing families with real choices -- for example, through the child tax
credit, FMLA, EITC, minimum wage, and CHIP.

       2. Health -- Response to Medicare Buy-in Announcement: Your Medicare buy-in
proposal provoked a great deal of comment. Some Republicans, including Senator Gramm and
Rep. Bill Thomas, were extremely critical of the proposal: they argued that it would only
exacerbate Medicare's financial problems. (Gramm compared Medicare to the Titanic and
warned about putting extra passengers on.) The base Democrats were very pleased with the
proposal -- particularly after Republicans strongly opposed it. Though liberal groups also were
pleased that we are addressing this issue, they believe we must include some kind of subsidy for
low-income Americans. Elite validators gave this policy mixed reviews: while uniformly

                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
Times) praised the self-financing feature of the program, while others expressed concern that the
proposal would create the demand for further, less fiscally responsible subsidization.

        3. Drugs -- Substance Abuse and Prisoners: The National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse released a study on Thursday finding that drug or alcohol use helped lead to the
incarceration of 80 percent of all inmates in the nation's prisons and jails. According to the
report, 1.4 million prisoners (out of a total 1.7 million) were high when they committed their
crimes, stole property to buy drugs, and/or had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.

        As you know, the 1994 Crime Law mandates that 100 percent of all federal prisoners
defined as eligible receive substance abuse treatment by 1997. According to the Bureau of
Prisons, the federal prison system has met this requirement. Since 1994, we have made some
form of substance abuse treatment available in every federal prison facility, tripled the total
number of inmates treated in the federal system, and increased the number of residential
treatment centers in federal prisons by 30 percent (from 32 to 42). In addition, legislation you
offered requires states to submit comprehensive plans of testing, sanctions, and treatment by
March 1998 as a condition of receiving prison construction funding.

         To build on these efforts, we are preparing a directive from you to the Attorney General
to: (1) require states, as part of their testing and treatment plans, to estimate current drug use in
prisons and measure progress yearly; (2) draft legislation to allow states to use prison
construction funds to implement their testing and treatment plans; and 3) draft legislation to
require states to enact increased penalties for smuggling drugs into prisons as a condition of
receiving prison construction monies. An event focusing on this directive is tentatively
scheduled for Monday.

         4. Drugs -- Anti-Drug Media Campaign: The anti-drug media campaign began on
Thursday in Washington, D.C. -- the first city in the 12-city pilot. Anti-drug advertisements have
started to air in the District during prime-time network television shows, with radio and Internet
ads to commence next week. ONDCP will roll out the media campaign in the remaining pilot
cities throughout the month of January. The other 11 pilot cities and rollout dates are as follows:
Atlanta (1120), Baltimore (1/13), Boise (1/13), Denver (1/16), Hartford (1/23), Houston (1/15),
Milwaukee (1121), Portland (1122), San Diego (1/9), Sioux City (1120), and Tucson (1/15).

        5. Crime -- Brady Checks: As you know, Arkansas remains the only state that is not
conducting background checks prior to handgun sales. Although Attorney General Winston
Bryant issued an opinion saying that state police have the legal authority to conduct checks, .
Governor Huckabee has ordered the police to refuse to do so. In response, Bryant has asked the
Treasury and Justice Departments to make him (rather than the state police) the designated chief
law enforcement officer for the entire state; under this scheme, federally licensed dealers would
refer the names of potential purchasers to the AG's office, and employees of that office would
check the names in the FBI's NCIC (rather than the state police's) database. Justice and Treasury

                                                                                    Management System
                                                                  Automated Records
                                                                  Hex-Dump conversion




     are currently inclined to grant Bryant's request later this month. This action may provoke a
     strong response from Huckabee, who is currently not aware of Bryant's request.

             6. Crime -- Slain Officers: The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund
     (NLEOMF) reported last week that the number of officers killed in the line of duty increased by
     nearly 40% in 1997, from 116 in 1996 (the lowest number since 1959) to 159 last year. The
     1997 figure exceeds the 1990s average of 151 line-of-duty deaths per year. NLEOMF attributes
     the rise in deaths to: (1) 1m increase in firearms-related deaths (70 in 1997, as compared to 56 in
     1996); (2) an unusually high number of traffic fatalities; and (3) 10 multiple-death incidents, in
     which a total of 22 officers were killed.

              7. Welfare -- Child Support Computer Systems: We are working closely with a
     House-Senate group convened by Rep. Clay Shaw's staff on the child support computer systems
     issue you discussed with Senator Feinstein this fall. Our goal is to put in place a new system of
     penalties that are large enough to ensure that states develop effective computer systems, but not
     so large as to disrupt states' child support collection efforts. As you know, current law requires
     us to withhold all federal child support funds from a state without a statewide child support
     computer system -- a penalty we intend to retain in the legislation (at least as a threat) for
     egregious cases. Shaw's initial proposal, which we think makes sense, would impose an initial
     penalty of 4 percent of federal child support funds in the first year, with higher penalties in later
     years. Once a state's system is complete, it could earn back a portion of the penalty. Shaw wants
     to introduce legislation the first day of Congress and move it through the House by the second
     week of February. As always, the Senate is expected to move more slowly, but could pass the
     legislation by April. By then, HHS expects nine states to remain without statewide computer
     systems: California, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Hawaii, Oregon, and New
     Mexico.

              8. Welfare -- Welfare Recipients in College: You recently asked us about a report in
     the Washington Post that some college students on welfare are dropping out of school to meet
     new work requirements. As you know, the welfare law does not count education that is not
     directly related to a job toward the work participation rates. States, however, have significant
     flexibility to excuse college students from work, given that the required participation rate is now
     at 30 percent and peaks at 50 percent. In addition, welfare recipients can combine work with
     their studies (as most college students do), particularly if work-study jobs are available. To
     encourage this result, we asked Secretaries Riley and Shalala to write to the nation's college
     presidents in September to explain the law and stress the importance of providing work-study
     jobs to welfare recipients enrolled in their schools. (Most work-study jobs are only 10 hours per
     week, but the letter explained that this is not a legal requirement.)

            9. Welfare -- Delaware Evaluation: Governor Carper released on Monday an
     evaluation of the state's welfare reform waiver program called A Better Chance (ABC). The
     program began in 1995 as one of the first comprehensive statewide waivers granted by the
     Administration. Initial results are encouraging: by the fourth quarter after the program started,


                                                      3


                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
percent lower average benefits than the participants in the control group. The evaluation found a
fairly high rate of sanctioning: 49 percent of the participants were sanctioned at least once for
failing to comply with the program's employment or family responsibility (immunization, school
attendance) requirements. It is interesting to note in evaluating these results that Delaware's
caseloads have not gone down as dramatically as those of many other states; the decline since
January 1993 has been 21 percent. This relatively low decline may result from ABC's "make
work pay" incentive that allows recipients to keep more earnings and still remain eligible for
welfare.

         10. Education -- California Math Standards: Proposed new math standards in
California have provoked a heated debate in the last few months, pitting educators who
emphasize problem solving against those who favor a more basic skills approach. The California
State Board of Education last month adopted the more conservative view, over the objection of
Superintendent Delaine Eastin. The head of the Education Directorate at the National Science
Foundation subsequently sent a letter to the Chair of the California State Board strongly
criticizing the decision and implying that it would jeopardize continued NSF funding for six
Urban Systemic Improvement sites in California. The letter upset conservatives (and others),
who viewed it -- in our view, correctly -- as an example of inappropriate federal intrusion in state
curriculum matters. Diane Ravitch warned us immediately that it could give Bill Bennett a
pretext for withdrawing his support of your national testing initiative. As a result, we worked
with NSF this week to draft a letter from NSF Director Lane to the California State Board
clarifying that NSF would not second-guess state standards and emphasizing the importance of
basic skills. Based on recent conversations with Ravitch, we believe this step has been sufficient
to prevent Bennett's reversal.

         11. Education -- Urban Education Report: Education Week issued its annual report
on education reform in the 50 states on Thursday, focusing on the progress in urban school
districts. The study noted that approximately 40 percent of students in urban districts reached the
basic level on the most recent NAEP 4th grade reading and 8th grade math and science exams in
1994 and 1996, compared to over 60 percent in each of these subj ects in non-urban areas. The
study also found discrepancies in resources, with urban districts spending about $500 less per
child annually than non-urban districts: The Education Week issue also detailed a dozen
promising reform strategies to raise achievement in districts around the nation -- ~, setting high
standards; holding schools accountable for results and giving schools greater flexibility; creating
small, more intimate schools or schools-within-schools; recruiting well-prepared teachers and
providing them with continuing training and support; training principals to be effective school
leaders; and promoting school choice. Your existing and planned initiatives -- including the new
Education Opportunity Zones proposal that you previewed in December -- match up very well
with these reform prescriptions.

        12. Education -- Life-long Learning Card: You recently asked us about Bob Reich's
idea of a life-long learning card -- essentially a bank card consolidating all federal education

    benefits (Pell, IRAs, education tax credits and deductions, and job-training funds), against which
    education expenses could be credited. DPC and NEC staff have begun to look into this proposal,
    but we do not yet have a specific recommendation. The Education Department is currently
    intending to begin a pilot project by October 2000 to use bank cards to disburse federal aid to
    post-secondary students. Our instinct is that bank cards may be effective to deliver grants and
    loans, but less useful for tax credits and deductions. DPC and NEC will continue to explore this
    issue.
