MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Mike Cohen

SUBJECT:                  Education Issues in Chris Edley's Memo


        The attached memo from Chris Edley argues that our ESEA proposals do not go far
enough in holding states and school districts accountable for results, while going too far in trying
to end social promotion. We respectfully disagree with both criticisms, and believe that the
alternative proposal Chris lays out is unlikely to achieve our policy objectives. Both the
Department of Education and OMB share our views respecting these matters.

A. Ensuring Accountability

        With all due respect to Chris, our ESEA proposal is simply not "too soft." The proposal
requires all states -- on penalty of losing ESEA funds -- to identify and intervene in failing
schools (including in appropriate cases by reconstituting or closing these school), prevent the use
of unqualified teachers, end social promotion (more on this below), and issue school report cards.
 In short, our proposals require states to put into place the set of education reform measures that
every recent study tells us works. In addition, our proposal includes specific, appropriate, and
feasible bonuses and penalties for performance. At your request, we have developed a new
mechanism for providing extra money to schools that make progress on state assessments over
several consecutive years. Also in response to your concerns, we have developed a plan to deny
administrative cost-sharing to school districts that do not make adequate progress.

        It is important to understand two ways in which this proposal diverges from Chris's.
First, Chris's proposal would leave Title I and all other programs now authorized under ESEA
completely untouched. His proposal relates only to a currently non-existent funding stream,
which is unlikely for many years (if ever) to comprise a substantial percentage of federal
education funding. Second, Chris's proposal includes no requirements for specific school
reforms; it is instead a block grant -- albeit one that can be taken away in certain circumstances --
for a broadly defined educational purpose (reducing racial disparities). Chris would make a
virtue of this approach, arguing that it is more "Presidential." But we have never accepted the
view that the federal government should leave all education policy decisions to the states; to the
contrary, we have tried to use our education dollars to get the states to adopt certain policies we
believe will improve performance (for example, reducing class size and modernizing facilities).
As Chris himself concedes, we increasingly know what works in this area -- and we know that


                                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion




           too few states are implementing these policies. To rely only on a far-off threat of removing
           federal money -- a threat that both past practice and common sense suggests is not altogether
           credible -- is to deprive the federal government of much of its leverage.

           B. Ending Social Promotion

                    Our proposal to end social promotion is sound and will be effective. We do not share
           Chris's view that ending social promotion is "a distraction" from your education reform agenda.
           On the contrary, it is a central part of holding schools, teachers and students accountable for
           results, as you demonstrated in Arkansas and as Chicago, Boston, and other communities are
           demonstrating ~oday. The policy focuses the attention of stl,ldents, parents, teachers, schools, and
           entire school systems on getting students to meet standards, which is the core goal of our
           educatiori policy. Recall that in Arkansas, passing rates on the eighth grade reading and math
           tests went from about 83 to about 96 percent once a no-social-promotion was put into effect.

                   We do not doubt that our proposal will be controversial in some quarters, particularly in
           the traditional civil rights community. Chris is right to note that some members of this
           community oppose the use of tests to hold students accountable for performance under almost
           any circumstance. They will not be happy with any policy to end social promotion that goes
           beyond paying lip-service to this goal.

                    We believe that the best way to respond to the concerns of the civil rights community is
           to insist that states and school districts end social promotion the right way. This means, as you
           have always said, coupling no-social-promotion policies with other steps to strengthen learning
           opportunities in the classroom, such as extended learning time for students who need it. It also
           means ensuring enforcement of the civil rights laws and putting in safeguards to prevent abuses.
           Our proposal that the Department of Education review and approve state plans to end social
           promotion -- as well as our proposal that states take up to five years to phase in these plans --
           should help to ensure high-quality implementation. (By contrast, if we do nothing in this area,
           some states will adopt irresponsible ways of ending social promotion.) We may not be able
           entirely to persuade Chris and others, but we believe that our continued insistence on ending
           social promotion policy the right way will blunt their objections.




                                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
