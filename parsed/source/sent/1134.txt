TEXT:
Could the two of you get togather and do up a scheduling request for the
President to announce HUD's Officer Next Door program? I am sending both
of you some materials on the program in case you don't have them.  And
Jonathan, could you make sure HUD knows that we're trying to get this on
the President's schedule and that they shouldn't go ahead themselves
before hearing from us? Thanks.
