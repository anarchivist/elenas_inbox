     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                     BRUCE REED
                               GENE SPERLING
                               CHRIS JENNINGS

     SUBJECT:                  Initiative to Reduce Racial Disparities in Health

             To support your race initiative, we have developed proposals that would commit the
     nation to an ambitious goal of seeking to eliminate some of the most severe racial disparities in
     health care by the year 2010. African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian·
     Americans suffer from certain diseases up to five times as often as whites. To reduce these
     disparities, the government will have to make a sustained effort to find effective approaches and
     apply them across all health programs. We recommend that the FY 1999 budget take a two-
     pronged approach to this issue by (1) expanding our finest public health programs so that they
     can address the problem of reducing these disparities, and (2) funding competitive grants to thirty
     communities to test innovative and promising new approaches in this area.

     Racial Disparities in Health Care

             The initiative would focus on six of the most severe racial disparities in health care:
     infant mortality, cancer, heart disease and stroke, AIDS, immunization, and diabetes. Some of
     these disparities are quite startling. For example, infant mortality rates are 2 liz times higher for
     African-Americans and 11/2 times higher for American Indians and many Hispanic groups than
     they are for whites. African-Americans have a 35 percent higher cancer death rate than whites,
     and African-Americans under 65 suffer from prostate cancer at nearly twice the rate of whites.
     Similarly, Vietnamese women suffer from cervical cancer at nearly five times the rate of whites,
     while Latinos have two to three times the rate of stomach cancer. African-American men also
     suffer from heart disease at nearly twice the rate of whites. Native Americans suffer from
     diabetes at nearly three times the average rate, while African-Americans suffer 70 percent higher
     rates. Minorities account for 25 percent of the population yet make up 54 percent of all AIDS
     cases. The Demographic changes anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of
     addressing these disparities. As minority populations grow, finding effective ways to close these
     gaps will become a critical aspect of improving the overall health of the nation.

     Validation

             An initiative that sets the ambitious goal of reducing these health disparities would
     receive overwhelming support from public health groups such as the American Public Health
     Association, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, as well as from


                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

minority groups such as the Intercultural Cancer Council, the American Indian Healthcare
Association, the National Hispanic Council on Aging, and the National Council of Black
Churches.

Proposal

         HHS is proposing to spend $200 million in FY 1999 for this initiative. OMB is currently
recommending an investment of $30 million (along with some retargeting of existing funding
streams), with all the new money to go to established HHS programs, and none to the community
grant proposal discussed below. (OMB believes that most communities do not have the
infrastructure necessary to implement new public health projects in the most efficient manner.)
OMB's lack of enthusiasm for this initiative results partly from a fear that we will not be able to
reach our goals. DPCINEC strongly support both parts of this initative. We believe that the
initiative will require an additional $80 million and that $30 million of this money should go to
the new competitive grant program.

·      Applying Current Effective Public Health Approaches to Eliminate Disparities. We
       recommend that you propose $50 million to apply some of our most effective public
       health approaches directly to reducing racial disparities. Our best public health programs
       already use effective prevention and education strategies to improve health care. These
       programs would use additional funds to implement and adapt such proven public health
       strategies to eliminate racial disparities. For example, CDC's breast and cervical cancer
       screening program could use additional dollars to target minority communities better, as
       well as to extend its efforts to other cancers (~, prostate and colorectal)
       disproportionately afflicting minorities.

·      Community Grants to Develop New Strategies to Eliminate Disparities. Eliminating
       racial disparities in health care will require not only the focused application of existing
       knowledge and best practices, but also the development of new approaches. We
       recommend that you propose $30 million in FY 99 to enable thirty communities to
       develop innovative and effective ways to address racial disparities. Each community,
       chosen through a competitive grant process, would commence an intensive program to
       address one of the six health areas. (For example, a grant might go to a Native American
       reservation to test innovative approaches relating to diabetes.) These grants would fund
       education, outreach, and preventive approaches that have not been attempted elsewhere.
       HHS would hold periodic conferences to educate the public health and minority
       communities about effective strategies developed by these communities, with the aim of
       extending these approaches across the nation.

·      Beginning Today to Reduce Disparities. To ensure that we begin this initiative
       immediately, we are identifying ways in which the FY 1998 increases in health care can
       be used to address racial disparities. For example, AIDS education and training centers
       are beginning a new partnership with the Indian Health Service to develop new
       approaches to educate health providers about training and prevention. In addition, the


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

National Cancer Institute will expand efforts to recruit more Hispanics into clinical trials.

                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    BRUCE REED

                         CHRIS JENNINGS

SUBJECT:                 Health Insurance Coverage Initiatives

        Throughout your Administration, you have worked to enact legislation to expand access
to affordable health insurance. The Balanced Budget Act included an unprecedented $24 billion
investment for state-based children's health insurance programs. This historic initiative will
clearly reduce the number of uninsured. However, there are other deserving populations whom
we could target in our step-by-step reforms. These include the pre-65 year olds (referenced in the
Medicare memo), workers between jobs, and workers in small businesses. In addition, we are
working on possible proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to people with AIDS and
disabilities through pilot programs. The policy development of these proposals is still underway,
so we have not included them here.

        Taken together, these initiatives total around $10 billion over 5 years. This amount is less
than half of the health investments enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act and less than 4
percent of the premium assistance proposed in the Health Security Act. Having said this, none of
your advisors believe the Medicare and Medicaid savings left after last year's deficit reduction
effort are sufficient to fund these initiatives. There may be $0.5 to 1 billion over 5 years in
Medicaid savings, but those savings will be difficult to achieve and there may be other claims on
them (e.g., child care, benefits to immigrants). Another possible source of funds is the tobacco
settlement, given the natural link between tobacco and health care.

         Your advisors uniformly agree that we need to take all actions possible to achieve if not
exceed your goal of increasing insurance coverage for 5 million children. A series of proposals
are described in this memo to help accomplish that goal. There is less agreement on whether we
should address a new group of uninsured people in this budget. The Department of Labor
strongly supports the workers-between-jobs demonstration; of all health initiatives in the budget,
it is their highest priority. OMB also supports that demonstration if sufficient funds are
available. HHS believes that this proposal has merit, but is skeptical that it will attract any more
support than it has in the past three years.




                                                 1


                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

        The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides funds for coverage of
millions of working families' uninsured children, a population that previously had trouble
affording coverage. It also builds upon the Medicaid program, which covers nearly 20 million
children. But important work remains to be done. In particular, we need to work with states to
enroll the millions of uninsured children in these programs.

        Medicaid eligible children are especially at risk of remaining uninsured. Over three
million uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. Educating families about their options and
enrolling them in Medicaid has always been a problem, but it has recently become even more
challenging. The number of children covered by Medicaid leveled off in 1995 and, according to
the Census, dropped by 6 percent in 1996. While some of this decline may be due to the lower
number of children in poverty, another part may result from families' misunderstanding of their
children's continued eligibility for Medicaid in the wake of welfare reform.

Options to Increase Outreach for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insuranc.e Program

       To address the need for children's health outreach, we propose a series of policy options.
Together, these initiatives could cost $1 to 2 billion over five years (or more depending on policy
choices about the enhanced match). Preliminary discussions with NGA and some children's
advocates suggest they strongly sup,port these efforts. In addition, the Administration is
developing partnerships to encourage a complementary range of private outreach activities.

        Enhanced match for outreach. One option for improving state outreach is to provide an
enhanced match to enroll children who are eligible for but not previously enrolled in Medicaid.
At the end of each year, if a state can document that it has increased its enrollment over its
baseline, it would receive an increased matching amount per newly covered child (possibly
through administrative payments). This policy rewards states only if they succeed in outreach,
rather than matching activities that mayor may not work. Depending on the amount of the
incentive and the administrative design, this option could cost to $0.5 to 1 billion over five years.

         Moving outreach to schools and child care sites. We could build upon the
"presumptive eligibility" provision in the Balanced Budget Act to make it easier to enroll
children in Medicaid and CHIP. The BBA option allows limited sites (~., hospitals) to give
low-income children temporary Medicaid coverage on the spot while they are formally enrolled
in CHIP or Medicaid. This proposal would broaden these sites to include schools and
appropriate child care sites, at the state's option. HCFA actuaries preliminarily estimate that this
proposal would cost $400 million over 5 years. Also, under the BBA, states that use presumptive
eligibility must pay for its costs out of the CHIP allotment, reducing the amount available for
other coverage. States have advised us that this requirement discourages them from taking
advantage of the presumptive eligibility provision. HCF A actuaries preliminarily estimate that
dropping this requirement would cost $25 million over 5 years.


                                                 2


                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
for children's health outreach is to increase states' flexibility in using a special Medicaid fund set
aside in TANF for outreach for children losing welfare. This $500 million fund is currently
allocated to states with a 90 percent matching rate for outreach activities to certain children. We
could expand its use to all children, not just welfare children. HCF A actuaries preliminarily
estimate that this policy would cost $100 million over 5 years. NGA supports this change.

        Simplifying enrollment. A simple, accessible enrollment process could encourage more
families to enroll their children in Medicaid or CHIP. To help create such a process, we propose
several actions, all of which are inexpensive. First, we could streamline the application process
by simplifying Medicaid eligibility and by encouraging the use of simple, mail-in applications.
HCFA has already developed a model single application form for both Medicaid and CHIP. We
could condition some of the financial incentives described above on using a single or simple
application. Second, we are reviewing the feasibility and cost of a nationwide 1-800 number that
will link families with their state or local offices. Such a number could be placed in public
service announcements, on the bottom of school lunch program applications, and on children's
goods like diaper packages.

Discussion

        There is unanimous support across agencies for focusing on children's health outreach.
HHS and Treasury believe that such outreach should be the Administration's first priority.
NEC/DPC and OMB believe that aggressive outreach will be needed to meet or exceed the
Administration's goal of covering 5 million uninsured children. Although OMB is supportive, it
points out that because some children may be impossible to reach and some states may not use
these options, we are unlikely to enroll all 3 million children. NEC, also supportive, raises the
concern that spending on an outreach initiative may be a communications challenge so soon after
the enactment of the $24 billion base children's health program. However, policy experts,
Governors, and children's advocates alike will endorse this initiative.

         One great challenge is the difficulty of finding savings from Medicaid to offset the costs
of this initiative. With this in mind, your advisors are considering the tobacco settlement as a
financing source. Specifically, we are exploring the advisability of allowing states to retain the
Federal share of the tobacco funds if they dedicate those funds to high-priority Administration
initiatives like child care, education, and health care. Governor Chiles would support such an
approach if we dedicate the funds to chi Idren' s health care, not just outreach.

        Families who lose health insurance while they are between jobs are a small but important
group of uninsured Americans. These people pay for health insurance for most of their lives, but
go through brief periods without coverage when they are temporarily unemployed. If they
experience a catastrophic illness during this transition, the benefit of their years' worth of
premium payments is lost. In addition, they could lose protection under the provisions ofthe
Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation once they regain coverage. Coverage at that point could be
subject to a new pre-existing condition exclusion period.                        .

Limited Demonstration

        This policy option is a modification of the program that we have carried in our last two
budgets. It would award grants to several states to provide temporary premium assistance to
eligible low-income families. States would use this money to partially subsidize families'
premium payments for up to 6 months. To test how best to address this population's needs, we
would select states using a range of approaches like a COBRA-based subsidy, Medicaid, or
covering the parents of children covered by CHIP.

        Since it is a grant program, we could make this program as large or small as we want.
To give a sense of the options, last year's $10 billion proposal over four years covered about 3.3
million people with incomes below 240 percent of poverty. Ifwe assume the same set of policy
parameters, a demonstration of $1 billion over 5 years would cover about 230,000 people; a
demonstration of$2.5 billion would cover about 600,000; and a demonstration of about $3.5
billion would cover about 800,000 people. OMB has suggested that we could limit the costs by
reducing the eligibility for assistance to people below poverty. However, NECIDPC advisors
oppose such a limitation because it shifts the target away from the middle-class families we
originally intended to help.

Discussion

         On policy grounds, all of the agencies support this policy. It has been in our last two
budgets because of its merits. This policy remains Labor's first priority because it targets a
particularly vulnerable group and addresses the worker insecurity issues that played such a large
role in the debate over Fast Track. OMB would support this initiative if there are sufficient
funds. HHS believes that this policy is no more viable this year than it has been in the past; HHS
would also object to using Medicare and Medicaid savings to fund this proposal. DPCINEC are
concerned about dropping this policy altogether and support a demonstration that is large enough
to be viewed as improving coverage. If resources are limited, however, we would prefer the
children's outreach initiative to this proposal.

        Workers in small firms are most likely to be uninsured. Over a quarter of workers in
firms with fewer than 10 employees lack health insurance - almost twice the nationwide
average. While 88 percent of workers in firms with 250 or more workers are offered health
insurance, only 41 percent of workers in firms with less than 10 workers are offered coverage.
This disparity reflects the poor functioning of the small group health insurance market. Studies
have shown that administrative costs are higher and that small busines.ses pay more for the same
benefits as larger firms.

Grants to States

        Given the disadvantages faced by small firms, the question is: are there policies that can
make insurance more affordable for small businesses and their employees? In the last two
budgets, we have included a policy to provide seed money for states to establish voluntary
purchasing cooperatives. These cooperatives would allow small employers to pool their
purchasing power to try to negotiate better rates for their employees. This year, we propose both
the original policy and a variation: a competitive grant approach so that a more limited number of
states could receive a smaller, but more targeted, pool of funds. The total costs would be $50 to
$100 million over 5 years.

Discussion

        All agencies remain supportive of this policy and believe it should be included in this
year's budget. In the past, we have failed to enact this proposal because Congressman Fawell has
pushed an alternative approach more attractive to small businesses. Fawell's proposal would
help small businesses to self-insure and in so doing escape all state regulation. Governors and
consumer groups have consistently opposed the Fawell approach, fearing that it would leave the
small group market with only the most risky and expensive groups, as low-risk groups move into
the self-insured, non-regulated market. Our recent conversations with Fawell suggest that he
may be open to compromise this year in a way that he has not been in the past.

SUBJECT:                 Reforms to Prepare Medicare for the
                         Retirement of the Baby Boom Generation

        The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) that you enacted took critically necessary steps to
modernize the Medicare program and prepare it for the twenty-first century. It extended the life
of the Trust Fund to 2010, invested in preventive benefits, provided more choice of plans for
beneficiaries, strengthened our ongoing fraud activities, and lowered cost growth to slightly
below the private sector rate through provider payment reforms and modest beneficiary payment
increases. However, the BBA's policies were not intended to solve the long-term problems
posed by the retirement of the baby boom generation.

       The Medicare Commission was established to address the demographic challenges facing
the program. However, a major policy and political question remains. Is there anything we can
and should do prior to the March 1999 Commission deadline that could further strengthen the
program and lay the groundwork for implementation of likely Commission recommendations?

         The National Economic Council (NEC) and Domestic Policy Council (DPC) have led an
interagency examination of several targeted policy options. This memo examines options for
coverage for pre-65 year olds, Medicare coverage of patient care costs associated with clinical
trials, and a project to increase awareness of private long-term care insurance. Financing options
to pay for these proposals follow this description.

         Your advisors have differing views on whether to pursue any new proposals while the
Medicare Commission is active and which proposals to pursue if you choose to do so. OMB and
to some extent Treasury have concerns about a pre-65 option, because it may open the door to
subsidies for a costly population and have the unintended effect of reducing employer coverage.
Both OMB and Treasury oppose the clinical cancer trials proposal because it could set a
precedent for every other disease group asking for the same treatment. In addition, altogether, it
may well be the case, that the traditional Medicare savings alone will not be sufficient to offset
the costs of these proposals. As such, a decision to propose a pre-65 policy may be feasible only
if the 'decision is made to propose an income-related premium or, much less likely, dollars from
any residual tobacco tax. It is worth noting that an income-related premium would clearly be
more politically acceptable to our Democratic base if it were linked to a benefit expansion.




                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        Although people between 55 and 65 years old are generally more likely to have health
insurance, they often face greater problems gaining access to affordable health insurance,
especially when they are sick. Individuals in this age group are at greater risk of having health
problems, with twice the probability of experiencing heart disease, strokes, and cancer as people
ages 45 to 54. Yet their access to affordable employer coverage is often lower because of work
and family transitions. Work transition increase as people approach 65, with many retiring,
shifting to part-time work or self-employment, as a bridge to retirement. Some of this transition
is involuntary. Nearly half of people 55 to 65 years old who lose their jobs due to firms
downsizing or closing do not get re-employed. At the same time, family transitions reduce
access to employer-based health insurance, as individuals are widowed or divorced, or as their
spouses become eligible for Medicare and retire.

        As a result, the pre-65 year olds, more than any other age group, rely upon the individual
health insurance market. Without the advantages of having their costs averaged with younger
people (as in employer-based insurance), these people often face relatively high premiums and,
because of the practice of medical underwriting, may be unable to get coverage at any price if
they have pre-existing medical conditions. While the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation improved
access for people with pre-existing conditions, it did not restrict costs.

        These access problems will increase because of to two trends: the decline in retiree health
coverage and the aging of the baby boom generation. Recently, firms have cut back on offering
pre-65 retirees health coverage; in 1984, 67 percent oflarge and mid-sized firms offered retiree
insurance but in 1997, only 37 percent did (although this decline may be slowing). In addition, in
several small but notable cases (~, General Motors and Pabst Brewery), retirees' health
benefits were dropped unilaterally, despite the firm's prior commitment to their retirees. These
"broken promise" retirees do not have access to COBRA continuation coverage and could have
difficulty finding affordable individual insurance. An even more important trend is demographic.
 The number of people 55 to 65 years old will increase from 22 to 30 million by 2005 and to 35
million by 2010, over a 50 percent increase. Assuming current rates of un insurance, this trend
could raise the number of uninsured in this age group from 3 million today to 4 million by 2005,
without even taking into account the decline in retiree health coverage.

       The last reason for considering the coverage issues of this age group is the likelihood of
proposals to raise Medicare eligibility age to 67, consistent with Social Security. The experience
with covering a pre-65 age group now will teach us valuable lessons if we need to develop policy
options for the 65 to 67 year olds.

        Policy Questions. Two central questions guide policy decisions in this area: what is the
target population, and what is the best way to cover these people.




                                                2

                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
chance that the policy does not unintentionally offset or reduce employer health coverage. While
this policy will not affect employers' decisions to offer coverage to their current workers, it may
affect employers' decisions to cover retirees, as well as employees' decisions to retire early. At
the same time, the current level of employer dropping suggests that a policy for the affected
people is needed. Although your advisors remain divided on the advisability of implementing a
new policy in this area, we all agree that any policy protect against substitution by limiting
eligibility to a subset of the pre-65 year olds. There are two design approaches to achieve this.

         The first approach is to limit eligibility by age. We recommend an age break of 62, which
is already the most common retirement age. The 6 million people ages 62 to 65, compared to
people ages 55 to 59, work less (48 percent versus 74 percent), are more likely to have fair to
poor health (26 versus 20 percent), and are more likely to be uninsured or buy individual
insurance (28 versus 21 percent). In addition, it is also the age at which Social Security benefits
can be accessed. Within this 6 million, we could limit eligibility to the 2 million without access
to employer or public insurance, and would require that they exhaust COBRA coverage before
becoming eligible. These steps should reduce the likelihood that the policy will lead individuals
to retire or drop retiree coverage.

        A second approach is to limit eligibility within a broader age group -~, 55 to 65 year
olds - to individuals who lack access to employer-based insurance for particular reasons:
(1) Displaced workers: About 60,000 people ages 55 to 65 lost their employer insurance when
they became lost their job because a firm closed, downsized, or their position was eliminated. (2)
Medicare spouses: As many as 420,000 people lost employer-based family coverage when their
spouses (almost all husbands) turned 65 and retired. This number could grow if employers drop
retirees' dependent coverage for these spouses as a result of this policy. (3) "Broken promise"
people: A small but visible and vulnerable group is the pre~65 retirees who lost retiree health
coverage due to a "broken promise" (ie., when the employer unexpectedly terminates coverage).

        How to Provide Coverage. The second question is: what is the best way to increase
access to affordable insurance? One approach is to extend COBRA continuation coverage for
longer than 18 months. Currently, COBRA allows workers with insurance in firms with 20 or
more employees to continue that coverage for 18 months by paying 102 percent of the premium.
The major problems with extending COBRA are that (1) people in small firms are not eligible,
(2) businesses will consider the policy an unfunded mandate, and (3) the policy could le~d to
discrimination against hiring older workers. In addition, firms could use this longer COBRA
mandate as an excuse to not cover any employees. Despite these difficulties, a COBRA
extension appears to be the best option for the "broken promise" people, since the former
employer would bear some of the costs of its decision to terminate coverage and COBRA could
then serve as a "bridge to Medicare" for this population.




                                                3


                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
Eligible people could buy into Medicare at the age-adjusted Medicare payment rate, plus an add-
on for the extra risk of participants. Because the actuaries think that most participants will be
sicker than average, this add-on will be costly. To attract healthier people and make it possible
for more people to take advantage of the benefit, we could defer payment of the additional cost
until age 65 by "amortizing" this payment. Under this scheme, Medicare would pay part of the
premium as a loan up front, with repayment by the beneficiaries with their Part B premiums after
they tum 65. The HCFA actuaries have estimated that this Medicare "loan" in a worse-case
scenario would cost $1.1 billion per year assuming participation of no more than 300,000 people.
 Because the preliminary estimates assumed that only sick people would participate and that all
would enroll in one year, and because they did not take into account the pay-back from
beneficiaries, the official estimates, expected soon, will probably be lower. Subsidies would be
considerably more costly and your advisors agree that we cannot afford it.

       Option 1. "Broken Promise" People Only. All your advisors recommend a policy that
employers who break their promise of providing retiree coverage extend COBRA so that retirees
can buy into their active employer plan at a higher premium as has been done for other special
COBRA populations until age 65. This option' has no cost to the Federal government.

        Option 2. Medicare Buy-In for Select Groups. The second option is to allow a limited
group of 55 to 65 year olds to buy into Medicare. If you decide to consider any of the Medicare
buy-in proposals, OMB favors undertaking only the "Medicare spouses" - primarily uninsured
women ages 55 to 65 whose husbands are already on Medicare. OMB argues that, if the goal is a
limited test of a buy-in for the pre-65 year olds, this is a discrete group whose eligibility would
likely have a smaller effect on the general trend in retiree health coverage or retirement. The
Department of Labor strongly supports a policy to help displaced workers, in line with the
broader theme of improving workers' security. In the absence of a buy-in, Labor would support a
COBRA extension, though this approach would help fewer people. HHS supports covering these
select groups, but is concerned that the enrollment be sufficient to justify the administrative
effort. The small size of these groups means that costs will be low.

        Option 3. Medicare Buy-In for 62 to 65 Years Old Plus Selected Groups. The third
option is to permit eligibility for 62 to 65 year olds plus a group like displaced workers. The cost .
of this option is not yet known but will likely be less than $5 billion over 5 years. HHS and
NECIDPC think that this is a sufficiently narrow group to limit significantly the effects on retiree
health coverage or retirement. This group is also more representative of the 65 to 67 year old
population, giving a better sense of what would happen if Medicare eligibility were postponed to
67 years old. Although Treasury is concerned that this policy could become an underfinanced
policy expansion, some concerns would be allayed if the buy-in participants were enrolled only
in managed care, so that the insurers and not Medicare bore the risk. This approach, however,
could be politically difficult given the distrust of managed care. OMB thinks that the 62 to 65
group is not narrow enough and that the "unsubsidized entitlement" (the subsidy is in the
financing) will not stay that way for long. It is important to note that we are still waiting for
actuarial analyses, which could alter the recommendations of your advisors.
B.      PRIVATE LONG-TERM CARE OPTIONS

                                                 4

                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
care, long-term care is not primarily financed by private insurance, which pays only 6 percent of
its costs. Medicaid pays for 38 percent, Medicare pays for 21 percent, and families pay for 28 of
the costs out of pocket. This large government role may not be sustainable as the baby boom
g~neration retires. Today, one in four people over age 85 lives in a nursing home. This could
increase substantially as the proportion of elderly living to age 90 is projected to increase from 25
percent to 42 percent by 2050. Thus, it is important to encourage the development of private
insurance options. The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation took 'a step in this direction by clarifying
that certain long-term care insurance is tax deductible. But because many people incorrectly
assume Medicare covers all of their long-term care needs and do not know about private long-
term care insurance, more action is needed. This action could include providing information to
Medicare beneficiaries about private insurance, funding a demonstration program to improve the
quality and price of private insurance, or both. None ofthese options includes a new Medicare
entitlement or subsidy.

Information on Quality Private Long-Term Care Insurance

        We propose to leverage our role in Medicare to improve the quality of and access to
private policies. HCF A would work with insurers, state regulators, and other interested parties to
develop a set of minimum standards for private long-term care policies. If a plan met these
standards, Medicare would approve its inclusion in the new managed care information system.
(As a reminder, the BBA included provisions to provide annual information on managed care
choices to beneficiaries.) This proposal would build upon that system and cost up to $25 million
in discretionary funds over 5 years ($5 million in FY 1999), distinct from the user fees currently
authorized for the managed care information system. We also could propose a demonstration
that would test the feasibility of a partnership between Medicare and private long-terril care
insurance on a limited basis. The cost of a demonstration would depend on its size and policy
parameters, but could be limited to $100 to 300 million over 5 years.

Discussion

         We believe this proposal has significant potential and is worth further developing. There
is some concern at HHS that coming to an agreement on a set of standards could be difficult and
that insurers may argue that our standards drive up the cost of the policies, making them
unaffordable. HHS also would prefer that any demonstration be funded through the mandatory
budget. However, these concerns may not be insurmountable, especially since one objective of a
demonstration could be to investigate high quality private options that are affordable. Finally, we
are still looking into the feasibility and advisability of using tax incentives to encourage the
purchase of private long-term care policies and/or the use ofIRAs for long-term care financing.

                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

        Medicare has not traditionally covered patient care costs associated with clinical
trials. Scientists and advocates believe that we are not making sufficient progress in
treating cancer, in part because the lack of Medicare coverage limits participation in these
trials. HHS and DPC have been working on an approach that covers patient care for a
limited number of these trials. Because of concerns about its cost, OMB and Treasury
strongly oppose this option.

        Nearly half of all cancer patients are covered by Medicare, yet Medicare does not
cover patient care costs associated with these trials. This care can often be prohibitively
expensive for cancer patients and their families, perhaps explaining why only 3 percent of
all cancer patients participate in trials. Expanding Medicare coverage could increase
access to trials for the many beneficiaries with cancer. Historically most insurers have
covered clinical trials for children. As a consequence, nearly 70 percent of children with
cancer participate in clinical trials. Scientists agree that this participation rate has helped
improve cancer treatments for children, and some argue that it is one reason for the
dramatically higher survival rates for children cancer patients.

         This problem has significant implications for research in all cancer areas,
particularly for those cancers like prostate cancer where scientists still have no good
answers and where clinical trials are particularly undersubscribed. According to a former
National Cancer Institute director, if 10 percent of all cancer patients participated in such
trials, trials that currently take three to five years would take only one year. Additionally,
as the nation's largest insurer, Medicare plays a significant role in setting the standard for
the insurance companies. A commitment from Medicare to cover clinical trials would go a
long way to encourage private insurance companies to cover these trials.

Proposal

        We have developed a proposal to expand Medicare to cover cancer clinical trials
conducted at the NCI and trials with comparable peer review. In addition, we would
require a National Cancer Policy Board to make further coverage recommendations, and
HHS to assess the incremental costs of such trials compared to conventional Medicare-
covered therapies. Assuming the true incremental costs are substantialiy less than the
actuaries project, as we believe, additional trial coverage as recommended by the Board
could occur. The initial coverage would cost $1.7 billion over five years. Senators Mack
and Rockefeller have developed a more expansive and expensive proposal (co-sponsored by
26 Senators), which covers all FDA trials, many of which the experts believe do not meet a
scientifically-meritorious standard. However, we do believe that there may be some middle
ground between our proposal and the Senators' proposal that could be justifiable on policy
grounds but more costly.

                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
dedicate resources from any significant increases that NIH / NCI receive in the upcoming
budget. NCI could use these. increases to simplify and centralize their clinical trials system,
which has the potential to increase patient access. Although this option may be viable, the
cancer community has clearly stated its preference for extending Medicare coverage.
Another possibility is to require drug companies desiring Medicare coverage of additional
clinical trials to contribute to the part of the patient costs.

Discussion

       HHS is supportive of this policy and believes that it would not only give Medicare
beneficiaries, who represent a significant portion of cancer patients, much-needed choices
but would encourage the private industry to cover clinical trials as well. There is no
question that this proposal is the highest priority for most of the cancer community as well
as many in the women's community who believe it is an essential step to improve breast
cancer treatment. However, the advocates have made it clear that they would strongly
prefer the more expansive and expensive Rockefeller/Mack approach. Conversations with
the Senators suggest that they would support this proposal as an important first step; this
support will weigh heavily with patient groups and the cancer community.

        OMB and Treasury oppose the Medicare coverage option strongly. They note that
it would involve very substantial costs ($1 to 3 billion per year) to provide medical services
that are experimental, and therefore are unlikely to help the majority of beneficiaries.
Once an exception has been made for experimental cancer drugs and therapies, they argue
there is no reason that similar support won't be demanded for experimentation with
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other maladies. As a result, these costs will grow as other
therapies are included. They also believe that Congress would likely expand the proposal
beyond coverage of NCI trials and that this expanded coverage will be very costly (up to $3
billion over five years). OMB also believes that rather than Medicare leading the way on
clinical trials, drug companies should be the first to contribute to improving access for
Medicare beneficiaries.

        While recognizing the OMB and Treasury concerns, the DPC/NEC believes that this
policy has potential to contribute to important expansions of clinical trials and possible
break-throughs in cancer treatment. We believe that we should investigate the possibility of
amending the current policy to tap into the drug industry as a financing partner. In addition, we
believe that this policy will be even more attractive if we are unable to find the resources to
double the NIH budget. Although we support the cancer clinical trial policy, if we have
limited resources available in Medicare and it comes down to a choice between the pre-65
initiative and this one, we would recommend the former.

       AN INCOME-RELATED PREMIUM

        We assume that the funding for these Medicare initiatives will require Medicare offsets.
One approach is to use Medicare anti-fraud initiatives. HHS and OMB believe that these offsets
could total about $2 billion over 5 years. This could fund some, but not all of the initiatives
described above. To fund a more expansive series of initiatives, you will probably have to
consider an income-related premium. As you know, Medicare subsidizes 75 percent ofthe Part
B premium for all beneficiaries, including the wealthiest. This policy is not only regressive; it
ignores the fact that higher income beneficiaries actually cost Medicare more than poor
beneficiaries. But the addition of an income-related premium would constitute a move away
from the concept of social insurance.

Anti-Fraud Provisions

        In our ongoing efforts to reduce Medicare fraud, we have identified a number of small but
important policies that could sum to about $2 billion over five years. Several of them address
problems identified by the HHS Inspector General, such as. the overpayment by Medicare for
certain cancer drugs, highlighted in recent press reports.

Income-Related Premium

        As you know, the Administration has publicly supported an income related premium.
However, it is not clear whether we should carry through on this support by including it in the
budget. The Medicare Commission will definitely consider and probably recommend this policy.
 Yet, there remains some Democratic opposition to this policy and some of your advisors would
counsel not to move unilaterally in this direction. Because this issue is extremely controversial,
this description is not intended to present recommendations but to begin a discussion of the topic.

        Building from our position last summer, the income-related premium would be
administered by the Treasury Department, not HCFA or the Social Security Administration.
Eligible people would fill out each year a Medicare Premium Adjustment form (a separate form
or a line on the 1040 form) and send a check to "The Medicare Trust Fund." The two open
questions are: who pay and how much do they pay. The answers to these questions determine
costs, but the more modest proposals generate about $8 billion over five years.

       Who pays. The income thresholds determine how many people are paying the higher
amount. We proposed thresholds of$90,000 for singles and $115,000 for couples in the Health
Security Act. Last summer, the Senate, including most centrist Democrats, passed a policy
where the extra premium payment began at $50,000 for singles and $65,000 for couples. During
the budget debate, we did not state publicly our support for any particular thresholds.

question. In the budget debate, we argued that a 100 percent premium (no subsidy) would cause
some healthy and wealthy people to opt out of Medicare. However, an analysis by the Treasury
Department this fall found that the effects of a 100 percent premium would be small. (About 5%
of beneficiaries who pay the full premium would drop.) HHS would strongly object to changing
our position and supporting an income-related premium that completely phases out the Part B
subsidy. Ifwe decide to change our past policy, it might be advisable to have a strategic
discussion about the timing of announcing such a change. It could be an important in negotiating
the give and take on this issue.

Discussion

        The decision to include an income-related premium is a complicated one. On one hand, it
is almost certain that this policy will be recommended by the Medicare Commission. At that
point, however, we will have less opportunity to direct any of its revenue toward important
Medicare reforms like a Medicare buy-in. On the other hand, many Democrats and possibly
AARP will oppose the income-related premium as a beneficiary payment increase. A possible
exception is if it is explicitly linked to a Medicare investment or possibly a pre-65 policy. In
addition, Republicans might label it a new tax and use our support for it as an issue during the
1998 campaign.

         Although our discussions are ongoing, the agencies believe that the decision to propose
an income-related premium depends on the context. OMB's position ultimately depends upon
the entire package of initiatives and savings being offered. OMB considers the income-related
premium to be a sound policy option, but believes that it should be considered as a means to
offset Medicare Trust Fund insolvency or provide benefit expansions for the currently eligible
Medicare population. HHS believes that if an income-related premium is pursued, its savings
should be used for Medicare. HHS further notes that Medicare has already contributed $115
billion in savings and that we may wish to preserve this option for the Commission
recommendations lest we have the Commission with no reasonable options. DPCINEC will
prepare for a separate meeting to discuss this issue.
