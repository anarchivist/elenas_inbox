FOlks--we're really committed to trying to have a memo to the president
with policy ideas by 9/10 so that we can meet with him in the week
following.  That means people need to meet and discuss in the next three
weeks--I'm counting on you--You all wanted to be sure that the Policy
Councils were fully integrated in the development of policy for the Race
Book--the time is now--THANKS.
