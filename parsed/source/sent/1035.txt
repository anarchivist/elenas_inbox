I had a call from Bill Samuel DOL about the Welfare to Work event - they
raised concern that UPS and Sprint while participating, not be highlighted
- on stage w/potus, or singled out in audience, as it will cause
reverberations from both Bahr and Carey.

Could you let me know what the program is, thx.
