Subject: Q&A on Press Reports of H-1B Policy Discussion



You mentioned that you had done a Q&A on how to respond to press
inquiries regarding the NY Times (and today's Wall St. Journal)
article on the H-1B policy deliberations.  I assume that we should be
saying much of the same thing to Congressional inquiries.  Could you
send me a copy of your Q&A so that I could put it in Ray Uhalde's
briefing book?

I will send to you and others several other Q&A's that we are
preparing for Ray later this afternoon for your review and input.

Thanks
