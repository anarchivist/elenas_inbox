  HHS:ACF/AOA; Ag/FCS

These are the last of these, I promise.  This is an invitation to you and
your staffs to sit down with me and my staff to go over the big issues for
the remaining OMB Director's Reviews in my area.

We will do Education, discretionary programs and student aid, on Friday,
November 7th, at 4 pm.

We will do mandatory spending in HHS/ACF, Ag/FCS, and the mUltiple-agency
child care proposals on Monday, November lOth, at 5 pm.

Both meetings will be in room 260 OEOB.

Our goal is to be able to reflect fairly your views on the agency
proposals in these areas, and other options you may have, when we meet
with the Director.

Please inform my secretary, Iratha Waters (ext. 5-6150) of your
availability.

Thanks.
