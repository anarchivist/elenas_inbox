As with the last 2 meetings, you are invited to this one as well.  Bruce
didn't seem to know that your office had been invited to the first one
(and I heard he wasn't very happy).  Please let him know that the DPC is
being invited via you.

Thanks.

The next weekly reconciliation meeting with the agencies will be in Room
248 at 3 pm (note time change from last week) on Friday, June 13.

There may also be a mid-week conference call -- details                 ~orthcoming.


As usual, we will have zero empty seats, so please continue to limit
attendance as we did last week. Thanks.

(Staff assistants:  please e-mail to me the names and phone numbers of the
agency representatives, and I'll do a list we can hand out at the
meeting. Thank you.)
