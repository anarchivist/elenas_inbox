MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:               DPC Weekly Report

        1. Welfare Reform -- IRS Notice on Workfare and Taxes: The IRS this week
issued a long-awaited notice clarifying that welfare recipients who participate in workfare
programs do not need to pay income taxes or payroll (FICA) taxes. State and local
governments welcomed this ruling because it allows them to run workfare programs without
paying the employer's share of FICA taxes. (As you may recall, Governors Carper and Chiles
were especially insistent that we issue this ruling.) At the same time, unions decided not to
oppose the ruling vigorously, principally because it makes clear that it does not affect the
application of the minimum wage or other worker protections to workfare participants.

         2. Welfare Reform -- GAO Report on Access to Jobs: A GAO report issued last
week on Access to Jobs -- the welfare-to-work transportation initiative you urged Congress to
include in the highway bill -- applauds the Administration's early efforts to implement the
program. GAO commends the Department of Transportation for coordinating Access to Jobs
with other federal welfare-to-work initiatives. It also specifically praises joint guidance by the
Secretaries of Labor, HHS, and Transportation, issued even before Congress approved the
program, to help state and local officials use available funds to provide transportation for
working welfare recipients. The same three departments are about to release an updated
version of this guidance, reflecting Congress's enactment of the Access to Jobs program. In
addition, we have worked with OMB to include a 100 percent increase in the program (from
the $75 million appropriated last year to the $150 million authorized) in your FY 2000 budget
request.

       3. Education -- Scholarships for Teachers: In Thursday's budget meeting, you
asked about our scholarship program for students who commit to teaching in high
poverty areas. This program, authorized as part ofthe Higher Education Act last year,
receives 10 percent ofthe appropriation for a broader Teacher Quality and Recruitment
Program, which also includes grants to states to raise licensing standards and grants to
partnerships between school districts and universites to improve teacher education. The
appropriation for the entire program in FY 1999 was $75 million, which gave us $7.5
million for approximately 1,400 scholarships. We and OMB are currently exploring
whether to propose an increase in the prograin for FY 2000, with a greater percentage (say,
50 percent) going to the scholarships.

the Future study on drug use trends among 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students. The study
found, for the second year in a row, a flattening of drug use rates generally, with significant
decreases in some categories of use. In the good news department, the study shows: (1)
declines among 8th graders in past-30-day use of inhalants (from 5.6 to 4.8 percent) and LSD
(from 1.5 to 1.1 percent); (2) declines among 10th graders in past-year use of all illicit drugs
(from 38.5 to 35 percent), marijuana (from 34.8 to 31.1 percent), and stimulants (from 12.1 to
10.7 percent), as well as in past-30-day use of marijuana (from 20.5 to 1.7 percent) and
cigarettes (from 29.8 to 27.6 percent); (3) declines among 12th graders in daily use of LSD
(from 0.2 to 0.1 percent) and cigarettes (from 24.6 to 22.4 percent); and (4) an end to the
recent decline in perceived harmfulness of drugs in all grades and an increase in perceived
harmfulness of marijuana and drinking among 8th graders. In the bad news department, the
study shows that: (1) the use of drugs remains at unacceptably high levels, with for example
25.6 percent of 12th graders, 21.5 percent of 10th graders, and 12.1 percent of 8th graders
using an illicit drug (typically marijuana) in the past 30 days; and (2) cocaine use, while low
overall, continues to rise slightly, with for example an increase in past-year use of crack among
8th graders from 1.7 to 2.1 percent.

        5. Crime -- Juvenile Brady: You recently asked us how many states have passed
laws prohibiting violent juveniles from owning firearms as adults. According to the most
recent survey by the Justice Department, 22 states have passed some kind of prohibition on
firearms possession by delinquents who have committed violent offenses. Of these states, four
permanently prohibit the possession of firearms, six prohibit possession until a court or the
Governor orders a restoration of rights, and the remainder prohibit possession for a set period
of time (S1..&, 10 years) following adjudication ofthe offense or release from ajuvenile facility.

        6. Health Care/Tobacco -- Meeting with Senator Kennedy: You are scheduled to
meet with Senator Kennedy on Monday to discuss the FY2000 budget. Among other matters,
he will raise the possibility of using tobacco receipts (either from an excise tax or from
recoupment of state settlement funds) for a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Such a
benefit probably would cost between 5 and 15 billion dollars a year -- far too much for tobacco
receipts to cover in the context of this year's budget. We do believe, however, that a
prescription drug benefit is an essential component of any comprehensive reform of Medicare,
and that you should indicate your desire to make progress on this issue this year. Weare
currently considering a way for you to talk about the issue in the State ofthe Union (which we
would like to discuss with you soon), but think it would be premature to raise the idea with
Kennedy.

         7. Tobacco -- Attorneys' Fees: An arbitration panel last week awarded $8.2 billion
in legal fees to the attorneys representing Florida, Texas, and Mississippi in tobacco litigation.
 The industry will pay the fees to the attorneys over the next 20 or so years, over and above
what it will pay the states. (The industry's annual payments for arbitral judgments are capped
at $500 million per year.) The panel determined the fees by multiplying 10 percent of each
state's settlement by a figure (between 1.9 and 3.5) representing the risks taken and work done


                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

by the state's attorneys. The panel used the largest multiplier to calculate fees for
Mississippi's attorneys, because they brought the very first tobacco suits. Minnesota's
attorneys settled earlier this year for the relative pittance of seven percent of the state's award.
Attorneys for the other 46 states have a choice between seeking fees from an arbitration panel
and accepting an offer of "liquidated fees" from the industry. Fees for most of these attorneys
will be much smaller, reflecting the fact that they did less work and took less risk in bringing
their cases.

                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
