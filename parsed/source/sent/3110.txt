TEXT:
OLC proposed amending the current language in the SAP as follows:
Keep the first two sentences.   ("Delete the provision which would replace the
current Amtrak Board of Directors with a new Board. The current Board has
proved capable of directing Amtrak during these sensitive times.")
Delete the third sentence.   ("Replacing the Board would only cause confusion
and delay Amtrak's ongoing reform efforts.")
Change the fourth sentence to read:   "(The Administration, however, supports
removing existing restrictions on the President's authority to appoint future
members of Amtrak's Board and requiring that such appointees be confirmed by the
Senate.) "
 (The current version of this sentence does not include the "and requiring"
clause. )
I just talked to Janno and essentially told him that I thought he should accept
this before OLe changed its mind.   I don't think DOT is giving away anything
remotely important by accepting this change of language.
