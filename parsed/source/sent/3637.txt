TEXT:
Steve Kelman. Marvin Krislov, and I met yesterday to discuss:
1. Governmental policy on reimbursement of costs incurred in "anti-union"
activities; and
2. Governmental policy on contracting with frequent labor law violators
I thought it was a pretty good meeting.  Kelman seemed very receptive to
preventing reimbursement of anti-union costs, either under existing law or
by issuing new regulations. He was much less receptive -- but not
entirely closed-minded -- as to discouraging agencies from contracting at
all with frequent labor law violators. He wants to speak with his own
staff and to some contracting officials about possible approaches on both
of these issues. He will report back to Marvin and Kathy (since I'll be
gone) with options.
