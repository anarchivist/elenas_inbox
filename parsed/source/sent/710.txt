Subject:         talking points

The 'last couple of days I have gotten calls from somebody at the DNC who
wants to get copies of some of our (publicly released) talking points on
education issues.   She says she used to get daily talking points from our
communications shop, but says that whoever used to handle that in
communications no longer is doing this.   She also says that she used to
call someone with this office who could provide her with these kinds of
materials (again, publicly released stuff).   I want to be helpful, but I
also want to a) follow the right channels on this kind of thing and b) get
the right system re-established instead of spending a lot of our time
sending stuff over to the DNC when communications or somebody else should
be doing that.

Can we discuss this?     Is this a topic for a staff meeting?

Thanks.
