The toys letter to Miller and Waxman is ready to go out --. it's been
signed off on by everyone, including the Departments . . There is one
outstanding issue -- who should sign it.  Brad wants it to be the VP, and
leg affairs is fine with that.  I had said I thought it should be the
President with some nice language about the VP, but I'm definitely not
willing to fallon my sword about it.   I told Brad to check in with you
tomorrow if it is going out and I'm not here.
