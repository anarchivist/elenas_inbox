          WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON
          EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING: WHAT NEW RESEARCH ON THE BRAIN
          TELLS US ABOUT OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN

          D&Learning begins in the first days of life.  Scientists are now
          discovering how young children develop emotionally and intellectually from
          their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin
          immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants .... We already
          know we should start teaching children before they start school.DS


          --President Bill Clinton, State of the Union Address, February 4, 1997

          Today, President Clinton issued a statement announcing the date and themes
          of the White House Conference on Early Childhood Development and Learning:
          What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About Our Youngest Children. The
          day-long Conference will take place on April 17, 1997 at the White House.
          The Conference will highlight how critically important childrenD,s
          experiences before school are to their development and their later success
          in school and in life.

          The Conference will focus on the practical applications of the latest
          scientific research on the brain, particularly for parents and
          care-givers. Also central to the Conference will be a discussion of the
          ways all sectors of society, including the medical, business, and faith
          communities, child care providers and government, can use this information
          to strengthen AmericaD,s families.

          Over the last four years, the Administration has invested heavily in
          research to help us better understand the importance of the first few
          years to child development and learning, and in strengthening efforts that
          support families and caregivers with young children, including:

          DDIncreased NIH Research Funding 23%.  Unlike other research areas, the
          federal government is almost the sole funder of research of children and
          youth, supporting over 90% of research on children and youth. Under the


             AgMS Email System                                                                         Page 2 of2
             Clinton Administration, funding for NIH research has increased by 23% since
              1993, to $12.7 billion in 1997. Between 1993 and 1997, funding for NIH
             childrenD,s research has increased 25%, from 1.3 billion to 1.6 billion.
             This sustained level of investment has helped support many of the research
             advances the April White House Conference will explore. In FY 1998 the
             PresidentD,s budget proposes to increase funding for NIH by an additional
             $337 million.

             DOEnhanced Head Start Participation and Quality and Created the Early Head
             Start Program for Children 0-3.    The Administration has enhanced Head
             Start participation and increased its funding by 43% over the last four
             years, and created the Early Head Start program in 1994 to support
             families with children ages zero to three.   Head Start provides low-income
             child·ren and their families with comprehensive education, health services,
             and nutrition.   The PresidentD,s FY 1998 Budget further increases
             participation to reach 122,000 more children in FY 1998 than when he took
             office.

             DOCommitment to Full Participation in WIC.  The Administration
             dramatically increased participation in the WIC Supplemental Nutrition
             Program, providing 7.4 million pregnant women, infants, and children with
             nutrition packages and information and health referrals -- 1.7 million
             more than when President Clinton took office. And his FY 1998 Budget
             would achieve his goal of full participation in the WIC program by the end
             of FY 1998. Research shows that every $1 invested in WIC prenatal serves
             saves up to $4 in Medicaid costs in the first 60 days after birth. [USDA,
             1990 Mathematica Policy Research] .

             ODLeading National Effort to Raise Immunization Rates.  In 1993, the
             Administration launched a national effort to raise childhood immunization
             rates by reducing vaccination costs for parents and vaccine delivery
             services, and increasing community education and partnerships. Today,
             childhood immunization rates are at record high levels.
