                     REMARKS FOR SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT
                               THE WHITE HOUSE
                                  APRIL 27, 1998

        Anyone who has ever been a parent knows the absolute joy -- and the awesome
responsibility -- that comes with raising a child. We will do everything we can to keep our
children safe from harm -- from strapping on their seat belts in the car, to bundling them up
against the winter cold, to teaching them to say no to drugs.

       We accept that we cannot always predict all the challenges that may come our children's
way. But the dangers and consequences oftobacco are plain to all. The temptation to try
tobacco is one of the greatest threats our children face.

        That is why today's disturbing news -- that more and more minority teens are falling to
the temptation of cigarettes -- must galvanize our efforts to protect all our children from tobacco.
 We all know that today's statistics are part of a larger trend: Every day, 3,000 young people.
light up their first cigarettes and become smokers for life. One thousand of them will die as a
result.

        The cold hard facts are adding up. The call to action is getting louder. And time is
running out. Congress has just four weeks to pass a comprehensive bipartisan tobacco bill that
can help save the lives of millions of our children -- that will cut teen smoking by raising the
price of cigarettes, imposing strong penalties on tobacco companies who continue advertising to
children, and giving the FDA full authority to regulate children's access to tobacco products.

         Senator McCain's bill is a strong step in this direction. Make no mistake about it: The
legislation explicitly changes the rules of the game so that the tobacco industry can no longer do
what it has done for years -- profit at the expense of our children's health.

       It is time to end the delay. It seems as if we're in a situation where we know what the
illness is -- too many children lured to smoking by unscrupulous, multi-million dollar advertising
campaigns that have targeted our youth for decades. We know that the cure is -- tough,
comprehensive bipartisan legislation to end these practices and cut teen smoking. And yet we're
hesitating. No parent who knows how to cure a sick child would stand by and do nothing. For
our children's sake, we must not walk away from this session of Congress without a
comprehensive tobacco bill.

         I don't want to tum this tobacco settlement into a political issue for the fall. I want an
achievement for this spring -- a bipartisan tobacco law that will open a new chapter in America's
efforts to protect the health of our children. Let us all work together to build a brighter future for
our children.

                                                  April 29, 1998


        The Honorable Bob Livingston
        Chairman
        Committee on Appropriations
        U.S. House of Representatives
        Washington, D.C. 20515

        Dear Mr. Chairman:

                The Administration strongly objects to the inclusion of any provision in the FY 1998
        Supplemental Appropriations Conference Report to allow for the importation of any modified
        semiautomatic assault rifles that accept large capacity military magazines. The Secretary of the
        Treasury, consistent with his authority under the Gun Control Act of 1968, recently concluded
        that these firearms do not meet the sporting purposes test and are generally not importable. Thus,
        the President would veto any supplemental appropriations bill that includes language
        undermining this decision.

                The proposed language would potentially allow for as many as 600,000 modified Uzis,
        AK 47s and other assault-type rifles to be imported into the country. While we know that an
        estimated 3,000 of these firearms have already reached our shores, we have almost no way of
        verifying the precise number of firearms "in transit." Moreover, we know from our experience in
        implementing a similar amendment in 1994 that an such an exemption will be nearly impossible
        to implement and could allow hundreds of thousands of modified assault weapons to circumvent
        the Secretary's decision.

               I strongly urge the Committee to reject this provision.

                                             Sincerely,



                                             Franklin Raines




                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
