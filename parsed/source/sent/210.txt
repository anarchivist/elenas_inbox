    Question: If a church or other religious organization hires a new welfare recipient, can the
    religious organization receive whatever subsidy is given to any other private employer?

    Answer: There are obviously tricky constitutional questions whenever a program involves
    governmental expenditures to religious organizations. But the goal of this Administration is to
    involve as many employers as possible in the effort to move people from welfare to work. And
    that means including as many employers as possible -- including religious organizations -- in any
    program to encourage employers to hire welfare recipients.



    Background: The law in this area is uncertain. Much may depend on (1) whether the religious
    organization is "pervasively sectarian" under Supreme Court law (i.e., a church, rather than an
    organization affiliated with a church) and/or (2) whether the employee is being hired for religious
    purposes. We should be supportive of including religious organizations generally in employer
    subsidy programs, without committing ourselves to defending each and every payment that could
    made to each and every religious organization under such a program.
