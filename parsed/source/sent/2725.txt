                             THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS
                                     March 17, 1999


Today, the Congress is beginning its first mark up on patients' rights legislation. I am pleased
that we are moving forward this issue that is critical to assuring Americans high quality health
care. Unfortunately, the Chairman's mark appears to fall far short of providing patients with the
protections they need. Because it only applies these rights to those in self-insured plans, it leaves
100 million Americans in insured plans without the guarantee of critical protections.

While states have the authority to pass patient protections for these plans, not one has passed all
of these protections. For example, dozens of states have not passed access to specialist
provisions or continuity of care protections to assure that patients do not have to change doctors
in the middle of a critical treatment such as cancer or a pregnancy. Tens of millions of
Americans should not be held hostage to the hope that their state may pass bills on all these
protections. We need strong Federal legislation to assure all health plans provide patients these
important rights.

Moreover, the Chairman's mark leaves out many of the most fundamental protections. For
example, it does not have an adequate enforcement mechanism to assure patients are
compensated when they are injured or die as a result of a health plans' decisions; it does not
assure patients access to specialists, such as oncologists or heart specialists; and it leaves out
continuity of care protections. That is why every major patient, doctor, and nurse advocacy
organization has concluded that the Chairman's mark is simply inadequate.

Today represents the first test of this new Congress to see if it is serious about providing
Americans with a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights to assure high quality health
care. I urge the Committee to do everything it can to pass this test and give Americans the
protections they need.
