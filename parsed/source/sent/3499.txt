The CA food stamp situation is stable for now.   (I gave a report on where we
were at Friday's staff meeting, but I think you may have stepped out before
then.) We've decided to try first to get a legislative fix on the CR (or
omnibus spending bill); John Angell and OMB folks seem to think that this is a
real possibility. In the meantime, CA has been given assurances (though there
were some initial miscommunications on this front that had to be ironed out)
that it can keep everyone on the rolls without being penalized by USDA; as a
result Wilson has announced that for now he'll keep all immigrants on the
rolls. I'll give you a fuller report on Tuesday.
You also asked whether I'd work on the FBI files class action. Of course.
Let's talk about that on Tuesday too.
