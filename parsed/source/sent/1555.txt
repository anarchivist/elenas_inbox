TEXT:
It's very beautiful. And I think you have the themes exactly right: a
deep-rooted belief in the dignity of every individual (as much a part of
his personality as of his jurisprudence) and a commitment to the
Constitution as a living charter of freedom.  Perhaps the only thing I'd
add is an unshakable determination to protect the underdog -- the people
whom no one else will protect, etc.

And a man who transformed America through his words should be recognized
by his words.  I'd pick out five great quotes, and put them in.  I think
that will be more effective than just talking about his rulings, as in
paragraph 5.

Again, it's quite beautiful and very moving.
