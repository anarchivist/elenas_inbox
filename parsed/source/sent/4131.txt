MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  DPC Weekly Report

        1. Welfare Reform: Council ofEconomic Advisers' Analysis of Child-Only Cases -- In response
to a recent item in CEA's weekly economic briefing on the growth of child-only welfare cases, you
asked whether certain features of the welfare law need to be fixed.

         The issue is that one part of the law appears to treat states with growing numbers of child-
only cases unfavorably, while another part of the law is too generous to such states. Since child-only
cases count when measuring a state's caseload reduction credit, a growing child-only caseload reduces
the size of that credit -- and means a state must put more people to work. On the other hand, a state
with more child-only cases can grant more "hardship exceptions" to the 5-year time limit. This is
because these cases are included in the denominator of the 20 hardship exception calculation despite
the fact that none of them need the exception because they are excepted elsewhere in the law.

        We do not believe a fix is needed at this time. On the caseload reduction credit, the
tremendous decline in welfare caseloads is already making the work participation rates far easier to
meet than expected. In addition, letting states calculate the credit by excluding child-only cases might
even give states an incentive to sanction parents and create more child-only cases. Regarding time
limits, we are loath to re-open the issue of time limit exceptions so early in the implementation
process and when there are many groups (battered women, disabled, etc.) that are pressing for more
exceptions, not fewer in this area.

       2. Welfare Reform: Agreement in New York State and California 011 Welfare -- In the
past week or so, state officials in New York State and California finally reached agreement on
welfare plans.

        New York State passed a budget that includes its welfare changes. The new law requires that
all individuals able to work must accept a workfare assignment offered to them. New parents are
exempt from work requirements until the infant is 3 months old, with extensions allowed until the
age of one. The plan also exempts from work those who are over 60, ill or incapacitated, or needed
in the home because of the illness or incapacity of a family member. In response to a recent
notorious case where a woman on general assistance with a history of illness died on a work
assignment, counties must make work assignments consistent with an individual's limitations and


                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        HeK-Dump Conversion
students on welfare, an idea Mayor Giuliani has resisted and continues to resist. The plan also
increases the amount of earnings that can be disregarded for welfare purposes. Child care will be
provided for children under 13 whose parents are assigned to work. The state will construct a system
of incentives and penalties for counties to encourage them to move people from welfare to work.
The final plan preserves current benefit levels, rejecting Governor Pataki's proposal to keep dropping
benefits as a family approaches the five year time limit. The legislature also rejected Pataki's plan to
block grant TANF funds to counties.

       After five years, families with children can move to a "safety net" program that features non-
cash benefits (presumably using state rather than federal funds). Also in this program are those
without children and immigrants not eligible for federal funds.

      New York chose to take advantage of a new state option to purchase food stamps from
USDA for legal immigrants who will otherwise lose benefits under federal law on August 22. New
York will buy food stamps for elderly or disabled legal immigrants and legal immigrant children,
which will preserve benefits for about two-thirds of legal immigrants.

         After a confrontation in California last month that culminated in Governor Wilson's veto of a
Democratic bill, the Governor and the legislature reached an agreement earlier this week. They
compromised on a plan to limit new welfare recipients to 18 months of benefits, with a six-month
extension option. Current recipients can get 24 months of benefits and then must leave the rolls for
at least a year before they can requalify for benefits. Able-bodied adults must work or be in training
for at least 20 hours a week; in the year 2000, that requirement increases to 32 hours a week.
Women with infants are exempt from the work requirements for three months to one year, at the
county's option. Children can continue to get aid after their parents reach the five-year lifetime limit.
 The state also enacted a lifetime ban on welfare for convicted drug felons. Democrats were unable
to win approval of assistance to legal' immigrants losing federal food stamps, or of a partial state
takeover of the state general assistance program.

        3. Welfare: Child Support Enforcement -- In light of the recent GAO study criticizing
states for not putting in place automated child support enforcement systems, you asked how we have
increased collections by 50 percent since 1992 and what more we could do, While as many as eight
states have told HHS that their computer systems won't be ready for certification by October 1st,
some ofthose states are using~omputers in some parts of their states already, Even the GAO report
acknowledges that the systems in place have helped those states improve collections, The real
problem is that this October 1st deadline is only for the computer systems needed to implement the
provisions of the 1988 Family Support Act -- all ofthese computer systems will need to be updated
and revised to enforce the new hire reporting, license revocation, centralized state collections, and
paternity establishment rules enacted as part of welfare reform. And, as you noted in your July 28th
speech to the National Governors' Association, not all states have even put in place the required state
child support laws necessary to begin implementation of the new provisions.



                                                   2


                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
you know, we increased child support collections from $8 billion in 1992 to $12 billion in 1996. But
during the same time the percentage of cases in which we collected support remained nearly constant
at 20 percent, because both the number of overall cases and the number of cases with collections
both increased. And despite our increased collections, we still collect only a fraction of what's
owed. For example, in fiscal year 1995, states collected $8.2 billion of the $15.5 billion of current
support owed and $2.4 billion of the $34.5 billion of past support owed, a collection rate of 54
percent for current support and 7 percent for past support.

         We believe that post-Balanced Budget Act, we should devote more attention to ensuring
states are implementing the tough new rules enacted last year. This is one reason why we suggested
that in your speech to the National Governors' Association you take states to task over child support
enforcement and were pleased that you urged "all the states to put in place these tough, state-wide
child support collections mechanisms as fully and quickly as possible."

        Now that you've issued the challenge, we need to help make it happen. We propose to
establish a child support enforcement oversight working group with DPC, NEC, Intergovernmental
Affairs and key HHS, Treasury, and Dept. of Justice staff to track state efforts and devise ways to
ensure they do all they can to build a stronger child support enforcement system.

        4. Welfare Reform: Tuesday's Event in St. Louis with the Welfare to Work Partnership
-- On Tuesday you will travel to St. Louis to underscore the critical role of the private sector in
welfare reform, praising approximately 200 St. Louis companies that will commino hire and retain
welfare recipients. We suggest you use the opportunity to hail the success of welfare reform nearly
one year after making reform the law of the land. We will have new caseload numbers for you to
announce (the rolls have declined by almost 3.4 million or 24% since you took office). We would
also suggest you highlight your successes in the Balanced Budget Act, which fixes the problems you
promised to fix when you signed the law and includes a welfare-to-work tax credit and a $3 billion
fund to help move a million more people from welfare to work. You could also announce that the
Welfare to Work Partnership stands ready to help companies all across the nation hire people off
welfare, with their "Blueprint for Business" guide and other information which will be available
starting Tuesday through their toll free hot line and their web page.

         5. Education: Lawsuit on High Stakes Testing in North Carolina -- This week the New
York Times and other newspapers reported that the NAACP Legal Defense Fund has filed a federal
lawsuit against the Johnston County School District in eastern North Carolina, challenging a year-old
policy which requires all students in grades 3 through 8 to achieve a specified score on the North
Carolina state reading and math tests before they can be promoted to the next grade. The case is one
of the nation's first federal court challenges involving state education standards and high stakes
testing.

        The suit was brought on behalf ofthe parents of 14 black, Hispanic, and white students who
failed the tests. The parents claim that the tests violate the equal protection rights of minority

      students, who disproportionately obtain low scores, and that the district's test procedure
      discriminates against special education students by failing to provide accommodations, such as extra
      time. The plaintiffs suggest that the North Carolina state tests were designed to measure how well
      schools and school systems are teaching the state mandated curriculum, but are not a valid measure
      of individual student performance. Domestic Policy Council staff has requested a meeting with the
      Department of Justice to discuss the case.

                6. Immigration: Revamping the Immigration System -- The U.S. Commission on
       Immigration Reform has prepared a draft report on structural reforms to the current immigration
       system. One of their options for reform is to abolish the Immigration and Naturalization Service
       (INS) and delegate its main functions to the Departments of State, Labor, and Justice. Under this
       scenario, the Department of Justice would be responsible for immigration enforcement,
     . including the Border Patrol, investigations, detentiens, and deportations; the State Department
       could perform functions relating to immigration benefits, services, and visa processing; and the
       Department of Labor would have responsibility for all workplace-related immigration activities.
       The report makes no assessment of operational difficulties posed by this option, nor an estimate
       of cost.

               The report also provides other options for structural reforms including: establishing a new
      Cabinet-level department or independent agency; creating an Office for Immigration Policy at the
      Domestic Policy Council; and establishing a standing body responsible for immigration policy
      development, similar to the EEOC or the FCC. The Commission's final report will be released
      in late September.

              7. Crime: Community Policing Grants -- On Thursday, August 7, the COPS Office
      released $92 million in universal hiring grants to fund approximately 1,300 officers in 48 states.
      To date, the COPS program has funded an estimated 63,000 police officers and deputies.

     Implementation of Children's Health Initiative. We have started a process with HHS, OMB,
     the First Lady's office, and others designed to assure an effective implementation of the new
     children's health initiative. By next week, we will have completed a timetable that outlines
     important due dates for any necessary guidelines and regulations to help the states interpret and
     design children's health plans. It will also list meetings/forums with state representatives
     (Governors, Medicaid Directors, etc.), children's advocates, health care providers and others who
     are extremely interested in the new children's health options. We will be evaluating whether
     participation by you, the First Lady, Donna and other principals may be desirable to highlight the
     new Federal dollars and opportunities to cover uninsured children. We are also producing
     responses to frequently asked questions about the new law, so interested parties have a good
     sense of the statute and the process for implementing it. Lastly, we are now reaching out to
     foundations to determine their interest in using private dollars for outreach efforts designed to
     cover the 3 million children currently eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid. There seems to be a
     good deal of interest and we will keep you informed of developments.

     Pediatric Labeling. Next Wednesday, the Vice President, the First Lady and you are scheduled
     to participate in an event that announces a new pediatric labeling regulation from the FDA that
     will ensure that drug companies test their products specifically on children and provide
     appropriate dosage levels to pediatricians and other health care professionals. Despite years of
     attempts at voluntary compliance, the drug industry still rarely does needed testing on and
     labeling for children. As a result, doctors either do not prescribe needed medications (for fear of
     hurting their patients) or attempt to approximate dosage levels, too frequently resulting in under
     or over-medicating fragile, young patients. Pediatricians, children's hospitals, consumer
     advocates, and AIDS groups (there has been little testing on the impact of protease inhibitors on
     children) are strongly endorsing this regulation.

     Arizona State Board Declines to Participate in National Tests. This week you received a
     letter from the President of the Arizona State Board of Education declining to participate in the
     national tests. The letter implies that Arizona's state standards are higher than the national
     standards, claims that the national standards take the "whole language" side in the reading debate,
     voices concern over a lack of guaranteed financial support after the first year of the tests (saying
     this w,Ould then become an "unfunded mandate"), and complains about professional development
     and other burdens that local districts would incur. The board's position is not surprising in light
     of the generally critical view of the federal role in education expressed by the state's elected
     superintendent of public instruction. The Department of Education is hosting a briefing for
     representatives of governors and chief state school officers on August 19th, which will provide a
     useful forum to counter some of the inaccuracies contained in the Arizona letter.
