TEXT:
why don't we just tell him he should introduce the fica/futa bill that
haskins proposed (but range I killed) a month or so ago (and promise him
our strong support if he does so)? the fact is that we can't control what
the irs will do or when it will do it -- so he can't rely on
administrative action taking him off the hook.
