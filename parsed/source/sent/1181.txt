        One of the principal goals of the initiative is to identify the critical issues affecting race
relations in this country and to propose governmental actions and policies addressing those
issues. We believe we must articulate this goal forcefully from the outset, so as to prevent the
media from portraying the initiative as simply a gabfest.

       In discussing policy initiatives, however, we must make two points clear. First, the
Administration's policy will unfold over the whole course of the initiative. We will not lay down
a full set of proposals in the San Diego speech or shortly thereafter; to the contrary, we will
announce initiatives throughout the year, in coordination with the town halls and other events,
while reserving some of the larger ideas for the President's Report to the American People. This
approach will emphasize the way in which the Administration's policy is responding to the
dialogue you have set in motion and the ideas arising from it.

        Second and even more important, the policy that the Administration intends to develop
will not be a reprise of the Great Society. No one should expect massive new programs run by
the federal government and involving the expenditure of large sums of money. Different times
demand different kinds of solutions, in this area as in most others. We must make this point as
strongly as possible to prevent commentators from contrasting, to our disadvantage, the size of
our initiatives to earlier ones.

        The Domestic Policy Council, working in close coordination with the Executive Director
of the Commission, will have primary responsibility for the development of policy. In general,
the DPC wants both to develop wholly new policy initiatives and to refocus or better target
existing Administration initiatives (Uk, the COPS and EZ programs) to address race-related
issues. To accomplish these objectives, the DPC intends to establish interagency working
groups, focused on particular issue areas, that will identify the most critical problems in each area
and propose both administrative and legislative solutions to them. Although t.he DPC will not
make any final decisions until we have named an Executive Director, the DPC currently intends
to form groups on employment opportunity (with the NEC), education, housing, health, and the
administration of justice (including both criminal justice and civil rights law).

        Some of the policies announced during the year will respond to issues arising (some of
which we do not now even know about) as the Initiative moves forward. For example, one of the
priority items for the DPC is to develop an action plan responding to the dramatic decreases in
minority enrollment in the Texas and California higher education systems -- and the more general
slowing of recent gains by minorities in college enrollment. Although work in this area has just
begun, the interagency group is exploring whether and how to pressure or persuade colleges and
universities to adopt new recruitment tools (including educational partnerships with certain
schools) and/or facially race-neutral admission rules that effectively will achieve a racially
diverse student body.

       Other policies announced during the year will attempt to address longstanding problems
in new and creative ways -- ways that go beyond or reorient current polarized (and increasingly


                                                                           "Management System

one that is -- not in whole, but in part -- about law enforcement authorities' failure to protect
minority communities from criminality; and we might respond to this understanding by using the
COPS program to increase police resources in underserved communities, expand the number of
minority police officers serving those communities, and improve diversity training for all police
officers. Similarly, we must recast the debate over educational opportunity within minority
communities, as we already have started to do, by emphasizing the importance of creating
national standards and then of providing students in these communities with the tools to meet
them -- for example, by ensuring that these students get their fair share of the most experienced
and qualified teachers through a combination of policies involving scholarships and loan
forgiveness, enhanced training programs, and reforms in teacher licensing and certification.
