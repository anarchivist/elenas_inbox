TEXT:
Where are we on legislative language that would respond to CA's request for an
extension of the food stamp certification period? I just got from Yvette
Jackson four versions she sent to OMB.  I may be wrong, but I think all four are
poorly drafted (all in the same way). Has OMB been working on its own
legislative language? Has it been presented to Leon?
