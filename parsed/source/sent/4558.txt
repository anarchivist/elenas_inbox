Subject:         Follow Up Meeting

Steve Ricchetti would like to do a one-on-one meeting with each of you
later this afternoon as a follow up to yesterday's strategy meeting. He
anticipates each lasting about 30 minutes.  Could you let me know what
times work for you, and e-mail me your priority lists? Thank you.
