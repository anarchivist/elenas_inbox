      TEXT:
      The memo your e-mail refers to went to the Staff Secretary late yesterday
      afternoon, but has not yet been staffed.   In response to your e-mail, I
      have asked the Staff Secretary to make sure that you, Maria, and Janet get
      a copy of the final version.   (I believe you came across a draft that John
      and Bruce were in the middle of editing.)
      As you all know, there are lots of complexities here, and we should not
      get ahead of ourselves.   In particular, we should not suggest to Becerra
      that we are willing to pay for a Spanish language test (even a
      commercially available one), until we figure out whether that promise
      would make Ravitch, Bennett, and the many people they influence walk away
      from the Senate deal.   (It might or might not have this effect.)  I worry
      about White House people talking with Becerra on this issue without at
      least consulting with me or Mike (who were out for the Jewish holiday) or
      Bruce (who was on a plane to Florida) .

      I received a call from Sec. Riley late yesterday seeking my views on the
      likelihood of support by Congo Xavier Becerra for a Spanish equivalent
      reading test that is available by commercial company. His idea was to
      offer this in lieu of the national reading test in English to designated
      Spanish speaking students. I agreed to work with Janet Murguia to contact


xavier to run the idea by him to see if their was sufficient interest to
pursue this with the President as an option BEFORE the Secretary went any
further.  Janet spoke to Xavier last night. He is interested in discussing
this option with us. I reported this to the Secretary. He would like us to
consider how best to get the President's consideration of this option, and
if approved, how best to open discussions with Xavier on it.

Late in my dealings with this issue yesterday, I inadvertantly came across
a memo to the President from Bruce, Mike, and John dated Oct. 2 on this
very subject. The Secretary indicated he had not seen it yet. I read parts
germane to this subject to him by phone. Elena is in today and has agreed
to meet with Maria, Janet, and I to revisit the memo in light of
yesterday's activity.  Sec. Riley wants to hear from us today on what next.

Again, I appeal to DPC to keep me, Maria, and Janet in the loop on all
Correspondence related to our national standards and testing initiative.
Each of us has different and important responsibilities to help with this
initiative. I have also alerted the Staff Secretary's office to my
concern. Thanks.
