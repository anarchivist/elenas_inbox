as you know, the potus really wants to speak at the firefighters
legislative conference.  and we've accepted. the one issue that i know
they care about is bio-terroism. apparently, the training provisions
within the bio-terroism initiative speak to a variety of emergency
preparedness types -- but does not speak to training for firefighters and
ems workers -- could someone in dpc check this out to see if there is
something we can do to make sure the training of firefighters and ems
workers is targeted --- if this does not have any negative public policy
implications -- it is a deliverable for the president.  thanks
