                             LOCATION:              Rose Garden
                             BRIEFING TIME:         12:15 pm - 12:55 pm
                             EVENT:                 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm
                             FROM:                  Bruce Reed/Chris Jennings


I.    PURPOSE

      To urge voters to elect a Congress that supports increasing patient protections, and
      to release a report detailing actions the federal government has taken to implement
      a Patients Bill of Rights while the Republican Leadership stalled on this issue.

II.   BACKGROUND

      This is an opportunity for you to urge voters to elect a Congress that shares your
      commitment to passing a strong enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights next year. You
      should emphasize that while the Republican Leadership stalled on the patients' bill of
      rights, the Administration has be·en doing everything possible to implement these
      protections in Federal health plans. To that end, you will be releasing a new report from
      the Vice President documenting action that the Federal government is taking within its
      authority to implement the Patients' Bill of Rights in the health plans it administers or
      oversees. In your remarks, you should make the following points:

      Criticize the Republican Leadership for allowing Congress to adjourn without
      passing a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. For a fun year, you have been caning on the
      Congress to pass a strong enforceable patients' bill of rights. For months, the Republican
      Leadership used every possible stall tactic to thwart the patients' bill of rights. When the
      Republican Leadership finally did introduce a bill, their proposal contained more
      loopholes than patient protections. It did not contain critical protections, such as access
      to specialists, and offered false promises, such as an appeals process that left the
      decisions in the hands of HMO accountants. In fact, Senator Lott would not even allow
      an up or down vote to be held on this issue.

      Urge Voters to Choose A Congress Committed to Passing A Strong Enforceable
      Patients' Bill of Rights. You should reiterate your strong commitment to passing a
      Patients' Bill of Rights in the next Congress and urge Americans to go to the polls


                                                               Automated Records M
                                                               HeX-Dum C           anagement System
                                                                       P on version
include enforceable patient protections, such as access to specialists, coverage of
emergency room services when and where the need arises, continuity of care protections,
an internal and independent external appeals process to appeal decisions made by HMO
accountants, and protections to assure that HMOs are held accountable when patients are
harmed or injured due to a health plans' decisions.

Announce the Release of a New Report From the Vice President That Highlights the
Administration Is Doing Everything Possible to Implement Patient Protections. In
February, you directed Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employee Health Benefits
Program, the Department of Defense Military Health Program, and the Veteran's Health
Program -- which serve over 85 million Americans -- to, where possible, come into
compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights outlined by the President's Quality
Commission. Today, the Vice President released a report highlighting that these agencies
have taken all the action within their statutory authority to implement patient protections.
 As a result, the Federal health plans are now, or soon will be, in virtual compliance with
the Patients' Bill of Rights. The report documents that:

           The 285 participating health plans, covering nine million Federal employees
           and their dependents, have been directed to implement new patient protections
           this year. OPM which oversees the Federal Health Employees Benefits
           Program (FEHBP) serving nine million Federal employees and
           dependents, has directed their 285 participating health plans to come
           into compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights. Through their
           annual call letter, OPM has specifically requested that plans
           implement new protections including access to specialists, continuity
           of care, disclosure of financial incentives, and access to emergency
           room services. Finally, OPM has issue new regulations to prevent
           "gag clauses." OPM is also sending information to beneficiaries to
           assure they are fully aware of their new patient protections.

           The 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are benefitting from critical
           patient protections. Building on Medicare's commitment to providing
           essential patient protections, HHS published an Interim Final rule in June
           that includes a series of new patient protections for Medicare beneficiaries.
            When this rule is fully implemented, Medicare will be virtually in
           compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights, including new protections
           such as access to emergency services when and where the need arises,
           patient participation in treatment decisions, and access to specialists.

           The 38 million Medicaid beneficiaries are being assured essential
           protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights. In September, HCFA
           published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) adding new
           patients protections for Medicaid beneficiaries, such as access to specialists



                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
              compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights, where possible.

              Over eight million Americans will receive the protections in the
              patients' bill of rights by the end of this year as a result of the new
              policy directive assured by the Defense Department's Military Health
              System (MHS). In response to your directive, DoD issued "The
              Patients' Bill of Rights and Responsibilities in the Military Health
              System," a major policy directive to all participants in the MHS. This
              directive outlined new protections for the over 8 million beneficiaries
              served by MHS, including access to appropriate specialists for
              women's health needs and chronic illnesses and rights for the full
              discussion of treatment options and of financial incentives. With this
              directive, which will be fully implemented by the end of this year,
              DoD will now be in compliance with the Patients' Bill of Rights.

              Over three million veterans are or will soon be assured virtually all
              patient protections. In July, the Department of Veteran Affairs
              (DV A) issued an Information Memorandum to participating health
              providers announcing its intention to have an external appeals process
              in place by the end of the year. Similarly, DVA established a task
              force to make recommendations as to how best implement
              information disclosure requirements consistent with Commission's
              recommendations and has developed a new brochure to provide
              beneficiaries the necessary information. With the implementation of
              these new protections DV A is virtually in compliance with the
              Patients' Bill of Rights.

              The 125 million Americans covered by ERISA still are not assured
              critical patient protections because the Department of Labor does not
              have the authority to implement them without legislation. DoL
              oversees the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA),
              governing approximately 2.5 million private sector health plans, that
              cover about 125 million Americans, issued new regulation to
              implement an expedited internal appeals process and information
              disclosure requirements. However, DoL's report underscores unless
              Congress passes Federal legislation, they do not have the authority to
              implement most patient protections.
