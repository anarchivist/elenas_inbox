    Mickey--Iots of things in flux, but these issues are on the radar screen
    in one way or another--for on tobacco, --elena, on rum tax--this may be
    part of extenders, unclear but it's in gene's shop-I'd call john kaplan to
    find out the latest, on chip, ed-flex and medicaid alloca--barbara chow's
    office should have latests; indian gaming--part of interior discussions,
    wes warren might be able to help (on this, I think there is resolution).
    While a budget briefing would make it easier--too many people working on
    all these issues (and more) and it's constantly changing.

    It would be very helpful to IGA to get a budget briefing on where we stand
    with about a half dozen remaining priority issues for IGA. They include Ed
    Flex, Medicaid Cost Allocation, Tobacco medicaid recoupment, Indian Gaming
    (Enzi-Sessions amendment), Rum Tax Cover Over, and CHIP dollars for Puerto
    Rico and Virgin Islands. What would you suggest?
