TEXT:
Some time ago, just before the VP went to California for the big AFL
convention, the President got a memo with discussion of a number of labor
law issues, inc~uding the comp time bill.  I'm about 99% sure that the
President returned this memo with a note on various comp time standards.
The subject came up at a meeting on comp time issues Friday, I mentioned
the President's note, and Podesta asked me to try to find it.  I don't
have it in my files, so I thought I'd go to the source -- can one of you
help? Thanks.
