Dear Members of The Federal Elections Commission:


        The rules governing our system of financing federal election campaigns are sorely out of
date. Enacted more than two decades ago when election campaigns were much less expensive,
they have been overtaken by events, by dramatic changes in the nature and cost of campaigns and
the flood of money that has followed them. Today, money is raised and spent in ways that
simply could not have been imagined when Congress last overhauled our campaign finance laws.
 We must bring the rules up to date to reflect the changes in elections and campaigning that have
overtaken our political system.

        An important step in this process would be to change the rules governing the use and
solicitation of funds not subject to the restrictions, contribution limits, and reporting
requirements of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act ('soft money'). Currently FEC
regulations (11 CFR 106.5) allow political parties to raise and spend 'soft money' in elections
involving state and federal candidates by providing an allocation formula between federal and
non-federal expenses incurred by party committees. These regulations, and limited additional
guidance provided through advisory opinions, are the basis upon which party committees make
expenditures and raise funds with respect to federal and state candidates today. The use of so-
called soft money by party committees today are largely based on the direction provided in these
regulations.

        Whatever the merit of those regulations at the time they were adopted, it has become
abundantly clear today that they are no longer adequate to the task of regulating current
campaigns. The role of "soft money" has grown dramatically in the past several elections so that
by the 1996 elections the two parties raised nearly $300 million; $154 million by the Republican
Party and $124 by the Democratic Party, more than [triple] the total offour years before.

       The current allocation syste, in short, is simply outmoded. Accordingly, I propose that
the FEC adopt new rules requiring that candidates for federal office and national parties only be
permitted to raise and spend "hard money" -- funds subject to the restrictions, contribution limits,
and reporting requirements of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA).

      Specifically, I am requesting that the Commission consider new rulemaking to
accomplish the following:

·      Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or
       agents) from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or
       prohibitions of the Federal Election Campaign Act. (This would preclude, for example,
       contributions directly from corporate or union treasuries, or contributions from
       individuals in excess of the amount an individual can give to a federal party.)




                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
    receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FE CA.

·   Provide that any amount of funds expended by a political party during a federal election
    year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter registration or
    get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising or any communication that refers to a federal
    candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA. (This would end the allocation
    system, currently authorized by the FEC, under which 'hard' and 'soft' money are mixed
    for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)



                                         Sincerely,




                                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
