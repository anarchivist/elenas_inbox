   TEXT:
   I'm sure you're already on your fifth draft by now, but I managed to read
   the first one last night.  It's quite good. Here are some comments, in no
   particular order:

   1. Why Dubois? I don't know the history very well, but I believe he
   broke with the NAACP in the 20s or 30s because he believed it had become
   too integrationist.   (He thought that the hatred of segregation signified
   a hatred of self on the part of the black community.) Mentioning Dubois
   sends a weird signal to a press that will be looking for signals on
   integration.

   2. On welfare: in addition to the transportation program and the WTW
   Partnership, we should mention our $3 billion welfare-to-work program in
   the budget. That's even more important that the other two things.

   3. In the transition to education, I would take explicit note of the
   NAACP's proud history of fighting for educational opportunity and
   equality. That's why it makes so much sense to talk about education to
   this group.

   4. I thought the education section wandered a bit.    I think I would
   organize it like this:
                   A.  Brief remarks on integration (by the way, I'd say "in
   our houses, in our                              workplaces, and
   ESPECIALLY in our schools.")
                   B. The need to improve predominantly poor, minority inner
   city and rural                          schools now (i.e., we can't
   wait for integration, we can't use the goal of
                                    integration as an excuse not to do
   anything about this mess)
                           1. The need for standards and tests to counter
   the tyranny of low                                     expectations
                           2.   The equally important need to give students
   the tools to meet this                         standards (another
   way to say this is to insist that teachers,
                                          administrators, school districts,
   etc. also be held to standards)
                                    a.  What we've done
                                    b.  New teaching initiative

   5. On the teachers initiative, we need to show better what a big problem
   this is -- how teachers in these schools are less well trained, less


      experienced, etc.   Mike Smith told me that there are some quite
      "impressive" statistics.   Mike--could you get hold of those and give them
      to Terry? Also, I wouldn't treat the teacher prep part of the program as
      so much of an afterthought. What we are doing here is to strengthen
      teacher training programs that operate in partnership with -- and place
      large numbers of graduates in -- urban or poor rural schools. This is not
      just a matter of training future teachers well; it's also a matter of
      improving the quality of teaching in those schools now through
      partnerships between the schools and the teacher training institutions.

      I think that's it for now.
