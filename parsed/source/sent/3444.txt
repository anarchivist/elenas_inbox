    MEMORANDUM FOR THE ATTORNEY    GENERAL
                            THE    SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                            THE    SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
                            THE    SECRETARY OF STATE
                            THE    SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION
                            THE    ADMINISTRATOR OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY
    MANAGEMENT AGENCY AND
                            THE    CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY

    BOARD
    SUBJECT:                Assistance to Families Affected By Aviation                and
    Other Transportation Disasters

    When an aviation or other transportation disaster occurs, the
    federal government properly bears responsibility for addressing
    the needs of families of the passeng~rs involved.   In the event
    of a disaster occurring abroad, the State Department currently
    performs such functions.   In the event of a disaster determined
    to result from criminal activity, the Department of Justice aids
    the families of victims.   No unit of the federal government,
    however, now has clear responsibility, authority, and capacity to
    assist families of passengers involved in domestic disasters not
    determined to be criminal.                                    .
    To fill this gap, I am asking the National Transportation Safety
    Board (NTSB), as the unit of the federal government with the lead
    role in investigating transportation disasters, to coordinate the
    provision of federal services to the families of victims.   Such
    services might include, as appropriate in the circumstances,
    providing speedy and accurate information about the accident and
    recovery efforts, ensuring that families who wish to travel to
    the accident site receive all necessary assistance, and arranging
    opportunities for counseling and other support.   I am also asking
    the NTSB to work cooperatively with state and local authorities
    and with private relief organizations, such as the Red Cross, to
    ensure appropriate coordination of the services they provide with
    those of the federal government.


   To enable the NTSB to perform these coordinating functions
   effectively, I am directing the heads of the Departments of
   Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, State, and

   Transportation, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
   recognize the NTSB as the coordinator of services to families and
   to cooperate fully with the NTSB regarding the prompt and
   effective delivery of such services.
   In particular, within 15 days of my signing this directive, the
   head of each listed agency or department is to designate an
   official who has primary responsibility for working with the NTSB
   to provide services to families.   Within 30 days of this
   designation, each listed agency or department is to enter into a
   memorandum of understanding with the NTSB, specifying services
   the agency or department will provide at NTSB's request, as well
   as specifying any other cooperative arrangements to go into
   effect in the event of an aviation or other transportation
   disaster.  The heads of the listed agencies and departments shall
   notify me promptly of all such memoranda.
   By ensuring that a sirigle agency has the responsibility to
   coordinate the provision of support services and the authority to
   call on other departments and agencies to provide such services,
   this directive will improve the capacity of the federal
   government to address the needs of the families of victims of
   aviation and other transportation disasters. .In so doing, it may
   provide some small measure of comfort to families that have
   suffered grievous loss.
