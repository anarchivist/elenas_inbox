     TALKING POINTS ON PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL
     T
     TPThe President will veto H.R. 956 because it intrudes on the
     traditional prero
     gatives of the states and unfairly tilts the
     legal playing field against consum
     ers.


     ?<XxThe Administration supports products liability reform at the
     federal level.
        Any legislation, however, must respect the
     important role of the states in ou
     r federal system and must
     fairly balance the interests of consumers with those
     of
     manufacturers and sellers.   Congress could have passed
     legislation, appropri
     ately limited in scope and balanced in
     application, meeting these tests.   The P
     resident would have
     been glad to sign such a bill.   But this bill unfairly
     burd
     ens consumers and unduly infringes on the States. (#


     ?D<XxThe bill displaces many rules of state tort law and does
     so in a way that
      peculiarly disadvantages consumers. As a
     rule, the bill displaces state law 0
     nly when that law is
     more favorable to consumers; it allows state law to remain

     in effect when that law is more helpful to manufacturers and
     sellers.   It is a
      one way 1 gF; anticonsumer and probusiness
      1street of federalism. (#



In particular, the President opposes the elimination of joint
liability for non
economic damages (such as pain and suffering)
 gF;
and
 gF;

the caps on punitive damages.

The elimination of joint liability for noneconomic damages would
prevent many i
njured victims of defective products from receiving
the full measure of their d
amages.


?8<XxThis provision would leave the innocent victim to suffer
when one wrong doe
r, in any case with multiple wrongdoers,
goes bankrupt. Under traditional stat
e law, if one
wrongdoer goes bankrupt, the other wrongdoers pick up the
 gF?
tab
 gF?
     This bill relieves the other wrongdoers of this
obligation for any noneconom
ic damages.    The innocent victim
has to bear this part of the loss on his own.
  (#


?x<XxThis is of real significance because companies sued for
manufacturing or s
elling defective'products stand agFGmuch
higher
than usual chance of going ba
nkrupt; consider manufacturers
of asbestos, breast implants or intrauterine dev
ices. (#


?-"<XxThis provision is all the more
 gFJ
troubling
 gFJ
 because ·it
disproportionately affects the most vulnerable members of
society
 gFL

 gFL
the elderly, the poor, and nonworking women.
This is because the provision app
lies only to noneconomic
damages, thus cutting most deeply into the damage awar
ds of
victims who do not have large amounts of lost income.  (#


    gFO
C
    gFO


apping punitive damages would encourage companies to engage in
egregious miscon
duct, such as knowingly manufacturing and selling
harmful products, and thereby
 endanger the safety of consumers. "h)O*O*O*l"
?<XxThe cap invites potential defendants, deciding whether to
manufacture or se
11 a clearly defective product, simply to
weigh the costs of wrongdoing against
 the potential profits.
Punitive awards deter such intentional misconduct by m
aking
deliberate wrongdoers pay more than the harm they cause. (#


?<XxThe provision gFRof the bill allowing judges to exceed the cap in certain
circumstances does not cure the problem, given th
  gFV
e
  gFV
  intent of
Congress, expressed in the Statement of Managers, that "the
occasion
s for additional awards will be very limited."     (#

The President also objects to Congress's failure to exempt
negligent suppliers
from the provision of the bill limiting
lawsuits against suppliers of materials
 used in devices implanted
in the body. A supplier of materials who knew or sh
ould have
known that the materials, as implanted, would cause injury should
not
 receive any protection from suit.

Finally, the President opposes certain provisions snuck into the
Conference Rep
ort that expand the scope of the bill and
exacerbate its harmful consequences.


?O<XxThe Conference Report, unlike the Senate version, makes the
limitations on
 noneconomic and punitive damages applicable
to negligent entrustment cases ca
ses in which, for
example, an injured person sues a gun dealer who knowingly
so
ld a gun to a convicted felon or a bar owner who sold a
drink to an obviously i
nebriated customer. (#


?<XxThe Conference Report, unlike the Senate version, would
prevent some injure
d persons from bringing suit against
companies that are being reorganized in a
bankruptcy court.
It does this by eliminating a provision that stopped the
sta
tute of limitations from running when a bankruptcy court
issues an automatic st


ay preventing lawsuits from being
brought during bankruptcy proceedings. (#
