Subject:         Mtg on proposed Non-Discrimination Executive Order

As we discussed, John asked that we set up a meeting (1/2 hour), at the
end of this week,  to discuss positioning on DPC's proposed executive
order banning sexual orientation discrimination in the federal civilian
workforce.

He suggested we include the following,       "and some others":

John
Richard
Rahm
Bruce Reed and/or Elena

I would also think about including:

Sean Maloney (he's coordinating for staff secretary)
Sylvia
Ann L:ewis
Maria Echaveste
Amy Tobe or press rep
Ginny Apuzzo
Ron Klain or VP rep
Laura Marcus
Chuck Ruff or rep

Thanks. R
