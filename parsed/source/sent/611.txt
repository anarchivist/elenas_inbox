Subject:         California trip

I spoke with Delaine Eastin this evening and confirmed that she is still
commited to endorsing our testing proposal and expressing her intent for
California to participate in it.  She is prepared for an event, with high
tech ceo's pn the 24th.  She has suggested a few schools in Union City
--diverse, working class community 45 minutes from SF, with excellent
schools that are involved in her challenge to adopt challenging academic
standards, great public support, and cutting-edge technology initiatives
-- as a possible site for the event.

I don't know if this works logistically, and told her we'd get back to
her. The good news is we have the confirmation we need to proceed.
