According to APWA and Lyn Hogan (who heard it from Mickey Kaus) , there is
something bad for private welfare to work efforts in the Ed/workforce
bill.  I'm still not clear on details, but according to Elaine Ryan it
says that under TANF, states may not require welfare recipients to
participate in private sector jobs, subsidized private sector jobs, or
subsidized public sector jobs, "unless the recipient is compensated at the
same rates, including periodic increases, as trainees or employees who are
similarly situated in similar occupations by the same employer and who
have similar training, experience and skills, and such rates shall be in
accordance with applicable law.  (Not clear what last phrase means; Elaine
wonders if this is Davis-Bacon type stuff??)

Not clear to me how much this requires beyond current practice, but Elaine
and Mickey Kaus think it's very bad.   Lyn says AFSCME snuck it in, and
Haskins was shocked when he heard about it after the fact.

On a ·second issue, Elaine raised an interesting criticism of Haskins' FLSA
solution that mayor may not be significant, depending on how extensively
you think states will make use of the trainee exemption.   She says his
language mandates paying the minimum wage for trainees, which our position
does not.   Elaine is very much into finding a solution here by making sure


the trainee option is wide enough.  She thinks everyone's picture of
workfare being ditch-digging is erroneously based on what Giuliani's doin
g, and that in fact states will create office workfare assignments that
are closer to training.  She just sent us a piece arguing that DOL created
a big FLSA exemption for our school to work program by hanging their hat
on the trainee exception, and thinks there is a precedent there.
