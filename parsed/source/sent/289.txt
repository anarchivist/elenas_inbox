Message Creation Date was at 15-FEB-1997 12:10:00

We'd like to put together a master list of action/event ideas -- things the
President can do in all the areas we work on.   Please include actions already
in the planning stage, as well as ideas still on the drawing board (or entirely
in your own head).   We'd like the first installment by Thursday, but consider
this a continuing project: as you think up or hear about ideas, please keep
feeding them in.   Thanks.
