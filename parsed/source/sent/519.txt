TEXT:
It's nice to know Ken is talking with people about fuzzing up the language
without telling us.  I am going to respond that we want the language kept
the same, unless you tell me not to do so.

Yes. Ken and I spoke late (c. 7:30 PM) about this, and agreed that the
best solution would be to fuzz the language up.  But that was before Chris
Jennings had discussed it with Bruce Reed and the Chief of Staff.  My
current understanding is that we are instructed not to change the
language. Of course, that can change within minutes.   I will keep you
posted.
