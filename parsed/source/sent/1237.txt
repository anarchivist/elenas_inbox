TEXT:
I just read Mike's cover note.  I think we should tell the President what
states we're having trouble with (though, of course, not in such detail) .
I wouldn't bother trying to state more explicitly the "on the right track"
message.  It inevitably will sound defensive; we're better off just
telling him what we're doing.  And the NCSL seems like a good idea to my
uniformed ears.
