Steve Kelman. Marvin Krislov, and I met yesterday to discuss:

1.     Governmental policy on reimbursement of costs incurred in "anti-union"

activities; and

2.     Governmental policy on contracting with frequent labor law violators

I thought it was a pretty good meeting.     Kelman seemed very receptive to

preventing reimbursement of anti-union costs, either under existing law or

by

issuing new regulations.    He was much less receptive -- but not entirely

closed-minded -- as to discouraging agencies from contracting at all with

frequent labor law violators. He wants to speak with his own staff and to

some

contracting officials about possible approaches on both of these issues.

He

will report back to Marvin and Kathy (since I'll be gone) with options.
