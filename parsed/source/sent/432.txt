TEXT:
I've asked Eric to review the latest version of the AIDS     memo, which
combines the two memos he sent.  I did almost no editing     on the material
in the original memo, but tried to condense the material     in the second
memo a fair bit.  I asked him to make sure that in doing     so, I didn't
distort his meaning or leave out anything important.
