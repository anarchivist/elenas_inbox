High Price, leading us again. I'll bet you dinner the President likes
this. And
I'll bet you a vacation that no one every gave him an opportunity to DECIDE
whether he likes it.

You see? I am resolute in lack of diplomacy. Feel free to forward to
Podesta.

>          WASHINGTON (AP) -- Minority children, who often attend
>          poor or struggling schools, could suffer under new efforts to
>          make schools more accountable for their students'
>          performance, some civil rights leaders say.
>
>          President Clinton's education proposals, which include tying
>          a child's promotion or graduation to rigorous testing, should
>          include plans to fix city schools and provide better teachers
 >          there, said Hugh B. Price, National Urban League president.
 >
 >          The civil rights organization has called for an academic bill of
 >          rights that would require school districts to prove they are
 >          giving minority children an equal education before adopting
 >          such test-based promotion plans.
 >
 >          "Accountability begins with quality,"   Price said. "Few
 >          urban districts can claim that the key ingredients are available
 >          to all students, especially low-income minority pupils."
 >
 >          Advocates for minority children have long complained that
 >          high-stakes testing and other changes rarely address the real
 >          needs of children: more qualified teachers, better equipped
 >          classrooms, stronger courses and more money in general.
 >
 >          Education Department officials say their proposals to change
 >          federal law to push for accountability will include money and
 >          support to target minority areas.
 >
 >          Some states, such as Texas and Ohio, have resisted the idea
 >          of excluding minority children from tests, arguing that all
 >          students should be held to the same higher standards.
 >
 >          Studies show schools with high minority enrollments are
 >          more likely to have less-experienced teachers and older
 >          equipment, as well as lower test scores. Many, especially
 >          black children, are also more likely than white children to
 >          have low birth weights, poor health care and come from
 >          impoverished families, all factors that usually hinder learning
 >          ability.
 >
 >          Memphis City schools Superintendent Gerry House says the
 >          district, which is 85 percent minority, holds all children to
 the
 >          same standards, but also recognizes that many children don't
 >          have computers at home or parents who read to them, so it
 >          set up after-school programs to compensate.
 >
 >          "We must not literally or figuratively fail our children
 >          because it's easier than recognizing our own failures,"  said
 >          House.
 >
 >          New standards should aim to rid poor schools of low-level
 >          courses and programs, said Vinetta C. Jones of the College
 >          Board, who noted that many high-school math courses in
 >          schools with poorer students don't emphasize algebra or
 >          calculus.
 >
 >          Budgets and grants computed from lower property taxes and
 >          census undercounts mean less money for poor communities,
 >          said Wade Henderson, director of the Leadership
 >          Conference on civil Rights, a civil rights law watchdog
 >          group.
 >
 >          "We need to compensate for years of deprivation,"   said
 >          Henderson.
