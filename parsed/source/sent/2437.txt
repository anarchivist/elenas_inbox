Here's section from SAP on the limitation on TANF transfer.       It's
definitely a bad thing.

"Social Services Block Grant. The Administration opposes a provision that
would
           restrict State authority to transfer Temporary Assistance to
Needy Families
            (TANF) funds to SSBG in FY 1999 to no more than the amounts
transferred by
           individual States in FY 1998. Enacting such a provision so late
in FY 1998 would
           inequitably limit State flexibility for the future. "

I'm still checking on the WTW obligation period.
