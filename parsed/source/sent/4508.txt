                                              December 28, 1998

      MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

      FROM:                    Jack Lew, Bruce Reed

      SUBJECT:                 Tobacco Budget Policy

              This memorandum briefly sets out recommendations regarding (1) how the budget will
      allocate the proceeds of our proposed increase in the tobacco excise tax; (2) how we will handle
      the issue of recouping a share of state tobacco settlements; and (3) how we will use any funds
      resulting from a federal lawsuit against the tobacco companies.

      1. Federal Tobacco Tax

              Our budget will propose a 55-cent per-pack increase in the tobacco excise tax beginning
      in FY 2000, as well as the acceleration of a previously enacted 15-cent per-pack increase to FY
      2000. The 55-cent tax hike is about equal to our last year's proposal (a phased-in increase of
      between $.62 and $1.10) minus the cost of the state settlements (about $.40); it also can be
      explained as half of the $1.10 proposal. This total tax package nets about $35 billion over five
      years, with the tax increase responsible for about $6.5 billion each year and the acceleration
      chipping in another $1 billion or so in the first and second years (see attached chart).

              We must choose between two different approaches to allocating this money. First, the
      budget could show that this money is going to pick up the dIrect health care costs (exclusive of
      Medicare) that the federal government incurs as a result of smoking. These numbers almost
      precisely line up: by our calculations, DOD, VA, and OPM spend almost $7 billion each year in
      smoking-related health care costs. This budget treatment is analogous to the theory the states
      used in presenting their legal claims -- i.e., that they were seeking reimbursement to the taxpayer
      for costs directly attributable to tobacco companies. Second, the budget could show that this
      money is going to certain (somewhat related) federal program costs. The two principal
      contenders are Nlli research and anti-drug programs. In either case, the proceeds of the tobacco
      tax increase would far exceed the yearly increases that our budget proposes in these programs,
      but would fall far short of their current levels of base funding (see attached chart).

               DPC and OMB recommend the first approach. We do not think we can easily justify
      linking tobacco revenues to programs for which we have not requested very substantial budget
      increases. We think that this approach would expose us both to the charge that we are using our
      tobacco policy to meet our budgetary needs and to the charge that our Nlli and/or anti-drug
      proposals are hollow. In addition, the idea of funding anti-drug programs through tobacco is
      likely to anger the public health community. Although the first approach (i.e., funding direct

logic to it (as the state suits showed) and minimizes our exposure to public criticism.

2. State Tobacco Funds

        Our budget presumes that starting in FY 2001, the federal government will recoup $4 to
$5 billion each year from the states' tobacco settlements. This figure represents the full amount
of the federal government's claim against the states (i&" 57 percent of their Medicaid
recoveries). Because this money would go into the base if we were to recover it through the
usual administrative process, our budget contemplates that Congress will effect the recoupment
by passing legislation that assigns these funds to specified programs and purposes (effectively
requiring states to buyout part of the federal base). We recommend that we take advantage of
the level of generality permissible in the outyears and refrain from listing the particular programs
involved in this scheme, so as to avoid unnecessary fights with the states and interest groups.

        We will explain that we have chosen to defer spending this money until FY 2001 so that
we can work with the states and Congress over the next year on a mutually agreeable menu of
programs to which the funds should be directed. At the same time, we will keep pressure on the
states by aggressively pursuing administrative mechanisms for recovering these monies. (The
states may doubt whether we have the will to take these administrative measures, but they would
doubt even more Congress's inclination to pass legislation diverting their funds to the federal
base budget over their objection.) The critical step in this administrative process involves
calculating the amount of each state's settlement award representing reimbursement for Medicaid
costs; once that is done, HCF A has the legal right to deduct this amount from federal Medicaid
payments.

3. Federal Tobacco Suit

        We (and Bruce Lindsey) are meeting with representatives of the Justice Department next
week to discuss their plan for bringing a lawsuit against the tobacco industry. Our sense is that
they are proceeding in a way that we will find acceptable. Our FY 2000 budget includes $20
million for the purpose of bringing this suit. (The money would go to the Justice Department,
but the Department could reimburse HHS, DOD, VA, and/or OPM for expenses incurred.) We
have not yet discussed with Justice Department officials our idea for announcing this suit in the
State of the Union.

        We recommend that when we announce this suit, we say that any money arising from it
should go toward reforming and strengthening the Medicare program, including through the
addition of a new prescription drug benefit. This approach would enable the President to begin
talking about a Medicare prescription drug benefit this year; it also could increase the pressure on
Congress to pass Senator Graham's legislation facilitating our suit. Although we almost
certainly would need legislation to allocate funds from a lawsuit to the Medicare program, we do
not recommend submitting such legislation prior to bringing the suit.
