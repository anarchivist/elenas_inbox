TEXT:
I just had a talk with Ted Bolling on two matters:
1. He passed along a suggestion from Mike Gippert that we change "suspended" to
"suspended or delayed." I told him I thought this was a bad idea: since the
phrase refers to sales that we have an obligation to phrase, we shouldn't
broaden its scope unless we have to.  He agreed.
2.  He said he didn't think the bid bond provision was a problem because there
might well be pure 318 sales that were offered where a bid bond was returned.  I
basically agree that this is not a problem.  But I told him he should speak with
Gippert and others and find out for a fact whether a bid bond was returned on
any of the sales that are ordered released under our new version.
