Subject:         OCT 14-CPI DISCUSSION

Katharine G. Abraham, Commissioner, Bureau of Labor Statistics, will,
discuss planned changes in the methods used to construct the CPI at a
technical briefing sponsored by the CEA on October 14, 10:30-11:30am.   The
briefing will be held in the Old EOB, Room 324.

Since early in 1971, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has considered
modifications made to some consumer items--principally automobiles--to
meet air pollution standards to be improvements in the quality of those
items.  Price increases resulting from such modifications over this time
period have not been reflected as increases in the Consumer Price Index
(CPI).  Beginning in 1999, modifications to goods and services made solely
for purposes of meeting air pollution standards, and that do not otherwise
provide direct value to consumers, will no longer be treated as quality
improvements in the CPl.  Price increases associated with such
modifications will be reflected as increases in the index.
