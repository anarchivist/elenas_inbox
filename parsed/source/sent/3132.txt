Have you set this up yet? Can I be included? I know the effort was to keep
this meeting small, and if it's getting too big, you should feel free to tell me
no. But I think it would help me, in dealing with the legal aspects of this
mess, to understand our legislative strategy as well.  Let me know.  Thanks.
