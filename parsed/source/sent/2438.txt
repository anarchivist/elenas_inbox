It appears as if our optimism about INS reform being a dead issue was
misplaced.  According to OMB and DOJ, Rogers continues .to push to get INS
reform attached to CJS (or to a CR).   Steve M. has asked Justice for their
suggested amendments to Rogers's bill that would make it more acceptable
to us (in case we need a compromise) .

FYI:  INS restructuring has been bucked up to a leadership issue.  INS
talked with Abraham's staff this morning following my calIon Rogers
continuing attempts to get INS restructuring into CJS. Abraham's staff
talked with Lott's COS on this issue and is attempting to get Hatch to
call Lott personally.
