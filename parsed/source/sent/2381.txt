Erskine just asked me to get briefing materials for his Thursday (8/6)
meeting with Rep. Eva Clayton on tobacco farmers today. Can you help me
get a briefing paper on this by 6:00 pm tonight? I understand, Janet,
that you have been pulling this meeting together so far.  Can you please
coordinate the briefing paper with Bruce and Elena to make sure we have
DPC's input as well? Thanks a lot.   Please feel free to call me if you
see any problems getting this done.

Kevin
