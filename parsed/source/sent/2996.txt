TEXT:
Melissa mentioned to me (I am ashamed to say several days ago) that in addition
to the people listed on the document request you prepared, you were going to
send the request to several former employees who might have files relating to
Lawrence (who, you might have seen, made Al Kamen's column this morning on an
unrelated matter!)  Who else should I send the request to?
Also, I take it from what Terry Henry told me when we spoke that we haven't yet
received a valid subpoena.  Is that right?
