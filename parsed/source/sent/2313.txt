TEXT:
we have a directive to announce on industry documents; call cynthia for
details. Otherwise -- assuming the state ags haven't announced a
settlement -- do the standard rap: bash congress for not acting, urge them
to do so, etc.  If the state ags have agreed on a settlement, we should
congratulate them and welcome the settlement, but then say that the job is
only partly done and that congress must now do its share to reach our
youth smoking goals.
