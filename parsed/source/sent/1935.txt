TEXT:
That sounds perfect, except that I wouldn't undersell the extent to which
we are providing specifics; I'm finding that our budget proposal helps us
to answer the Republican attack that we're failing to show leadership.   On
the issue of size, you're of course right that we will not object if
Congress sees fit to enact larger taxes, payments, or penalties. And if
asked about allocation of these surplus funds, we should just talk about
working closely with Congress and the states to allocate these funds in a
way that benefits our children and the public health.

Subject:         Re: Tobacco Budget and Q&A.

I have been trying to leave the impression that the budget does not
address in detail the scope of tobacco legislation.   I have also been
saying that it does not address the question of liability or what to do
with any revenue that may exceed the $65 billion. In that sense I may
have suggested it as a floor.  I agree with the characterization of our
number as representing the amount necessary to address youth smoking, and
thought I had said that as well.  What do you think we should say in
response to questions about potentially larger revenue streams?
