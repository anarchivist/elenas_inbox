TEXT:
We should probably do a weekly item on what the report says, what we're
already doing, what we've committed to do, what we might do, what we can't
do, etc. Employment testing raises a lot of hackles and we/the EEOC
essentially struck a bargain last year on this issue in order to gain
increased funding.  You should call Julie Fernandes for the details.
