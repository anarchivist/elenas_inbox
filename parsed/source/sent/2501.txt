Of course, he should not contradict what the President said yesterday.
But right now, public health groups are lobbying the states not to sign on
to the agreement; AGs are lobbying states to sign on to the agreement --
do we have a position?  If so, why? What analysis do we possess that
indicates that we have a reason to believe that a particular state would
be better off under this agreement than they would be pursuing their own
lawsuit -- or vice versa? I just don't understand what basis we would
have for offering states any advice on this question -- any more than we
advised them to sue or settle in the first place.

As for the rest, I think it is key that we not attack the settlement --
but also, that we not allow the tobacco industry to portray the set'tlement
as more than it is.  It does not penlize tobacco companies for continuing
to market to minors; it does not provide financial inducments to reduce
marketing to minors; it does not provide the FDA with jurisdiction to
prevent marketting to minors. Again, that is not the fault of the AGs
that is not what they were trying to do with this deal. But in making it
clear why Congress needs to act, we must make it clear what is the
unfinished business left after this settlement is reached.
