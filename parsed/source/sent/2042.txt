I'm semi on top of this.          I get all the fun stuff, don't I?

I think there will be a meeting on Monday.  Maria E. just called me up to
and I think she will attend to make certain this process gets off to a
good start.

Do you have any desire in attending? If not,                 I'll be sure to keep you
apprised of developments on this issue.

If the process goes according to how I think it should, we will not
immediately agree on a package of initiatives. We will set up some
meetings with the appropriate groups to review options and to get them
invested and trusting in us.  We will also highlight investments that we
believe already should be very attractive to minority representatives --
like the kids outreach stuff.

The goal will be for us to be sensitive to their needs while they become
trusting enough in us to be flexible on their priorities as the larger
package unfolds. Hopefully that will help Bruce, Elena and you have a
little more room to operate.  While it won't be easy and it might be time
consuming, I think this is a better approach than immediately coming up
with a package that could take on the same troubled waters that the school
construction piece did last year.  Hope that sounds ok to yOU?

, while we become Rather, I think we should talk with them about options
and haveit will likely take a while to get folks invested and trusting in
us.
