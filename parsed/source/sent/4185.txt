I'm inclined to do this by way of our weekly report (as Erskine suggested)
and notto do a sanitized version.  Is that OK?

Subject:         Weekly report from PIR

PIR team leaders--

        I'll be compiling the weekly report to the President from PIR.
Sylvia Mathews wants us to include updates from all the working groups.
I'll need to get information from you by the end of the day on Wednesdays
in order to make our Friday deadlines.  (For this week, that means
tomorrow).  If you are not the contact person, please let me know who on
your team will be.  In the updates, please include activities that you
expect to occur on Thursday and Friday of the week.

        Also, because we are working out of the Department of Justice,
please remember that the updates you send to me are subject to the Freedom
of Information Act as are all of our weekly reports.

           Thanks for your help.

                                                     --Jacinta
