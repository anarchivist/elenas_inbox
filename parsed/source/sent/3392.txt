TEXT:
One slight amendment: As I understand it, the bill authorizes (not requires) the
AG to designate certain programs as ones for which aliens will continue to be
eligible.  So in designating such programs -- thereby keeping them open to legal
aliens -- the AG is doing something she is specifically authorized, but not
required, to do.
