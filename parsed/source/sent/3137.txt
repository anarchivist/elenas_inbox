TEXT:
1. The Forest Service mess is still not resolved. At one point in the
afternoon, the Forest Service swore it knew what was as yet unreported: 150
million bd. ft of 1990 sales. Then it turned out at the 2:00 meeting that the
Forest Service was unaware of an obligation to list sales that occurred prior to
1990.   So the Forest Service now has to start a search for these earlier sales.
There may be none; there may be a lot.   It's impossible right now to know.    It
also seems highly uncertain whether there are really 150 million bd ft of
unreported 1990 sales.   I have suggested to Jennifer that Harold call over to
the Forest Service to tell it to get its act together.    It's obviously very
difficult to figure out what we want to do on any front -- litigation,
legislation, or administrative action -- until we know the full scope of the
problem.
2. There's no word yet from Judge Hogan. Lois is convinced that Mark Rutzick,
attorney for the plaintiffs, will respond to DOJ's pleading of last night by
filing a motion for contempt and/or sanctions today.    He hasn't filed anything
yet, but Lois thinks the shoe will probably drop at any moment.
3. At the 2:00 meeting, which is attended by lots of agency and DOJ people,
there was much sentiment for greater guidance from the white House.     (A bit
ironic in light of our experience with Justice, but ... ) Some participants at
the meeting argued: they are, as a matter of course, making decisions every day
abouc how to interpret and enforce this statute; they have received conflicting
signals from the White House; they have no principles to guide their decisions'
what they really need is a clear guiding principle      e.g., interpret the
statute as narrowly as possible.
4.   I haven't had a chance to look at the Option 9 language/legislative history,
but will try to do so tonight or tomorrow.   You're right, of course, as to its
importance.
