As a follow-up to our conversation, I did speak with Congresswoman Waters
about the Grandmother's exemption. I informed her that we were aware of
the issue and that you would contact the appropriate person in her office
to discuss it further to avoid using her time in the larger CBC
meeting.   Apparently this commitment was made to her once before and her.
staff person has received the "run around."    Well I must say', I wasn't
sure if she was going to keep it off the table but she did.     I have given
no indication that there is a resolution -- but I do think that it is
important that we follow-up in~ood faith. The contact person for the
Congresswoman is Cathy Atkin    L  P6/(b)(6) f [6DiJ
Thanks for your help on this!
