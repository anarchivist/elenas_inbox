I wanted to let you know what Dr. Collins plans to discuss in tomorrow's

agenda will include:

The new 5 year plan (copies of which they will bring)
Today's announcement of new awards being given to accelerate the
production of a working draft of the genome
Discussion of the use and value of the working draft
The importance of public access to genome data (the HGP and private sector
initiatives, i.e. Celera, will be discussed here)
Policy initiatives, such as the genetics nondiscrimination EO

seeing you.

Joanne
