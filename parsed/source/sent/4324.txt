Question:   The Administration has pointed to the decline in welfare caseloads as a sign
            that welfare reform is working, yet a story in today's Washington Post says
            one of the main reasons people are leaving the rolls is that they are being
            sanctioned. Do you consider this a success?

Answer:     One of the principles of the welfare reform law enacted in August 1996 is
            personal responsibility. Establishing fair, firm and credible consequences if
            people fail to follow the rules is an important part of the new approach. Different
            people react differently to sanctions. For some people, sanctioning may be a step
            along the way to work. Data from several state studies finds that after being
            sanctioned, about halfthe people are working and approximately 40 percent have
            an increase in their income. Several states also found that one-quarter to one-third
            of those sanctioned returned to the rolls, presumably after complying with the
            requirements.

            While some states do appear to be increasing their use of sanctions, it is too early
            to confirm this trend on a national basis. HHS is still compiling state data under
            the new welfare reform reporting system. According to HHS, in 1993 and 1995
            33% and 32% of cases were closed for failure to comply with procedural
            requirements and the preliminary figure for October 1996 to June 1997 was 38%.

Question:   The Post article cited a women in Tennessee who was sanctioned even though
            she had back problems. Isn't it unfair to require someone like that to work?

            Federal law requires states to put 30 percent of recipients to work this year (a
            figure which rises to 50 percent by the year 2002) and gives states considerable
            flexibility in how they apply these work rules. According to a recent survey by
            the American Public Welfare Association, most states waive sanctions when a
            person has good cause for not complying, and disability, incapacity or illness are
            the most frequently cited reason for good cause (by 31 states). In addition, low
            income individuals whose disabilities prevent them from working can receive
            assistance under the federal SSI program, for which the work rules do not apply.


Question:   Today's New York Times cites evidence in New York that only one-third of
            those leaving the rolls are actually working. Are you disappointed by these
            results?

Answer:     While we haven't seen these preliminary New York State data, we do know
            that a number of other states have had much better results, finding between
            50% and 60% of those leaving the rolls were working. In an effort to give
            states strong incentives to help as many recipients go to work as possible, .
            UUS recently announced rules for a High Performance Bonus that will award
            $200 million a year to the states who have the most success in placing people in
            jobs and ensuring that welfare recipients succeed in jobs once they get them, by
            remaining employed and increasing their earnings over time.
