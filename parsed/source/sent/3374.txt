    PRINTER FONT 12 POINT ROMAN
    TALKING POINTS ON H.R. 1833
    ?        The President vetoed H.R. 1833, which would have prohibited a
    certain kind of abortion procedure,   for one reason: because
    it failed to include an exemption that would have.permitted
    the use of this procedure in the rare cases where it is
    necessary to protect women from serious threats to their
    health. The President could not sign a bill that would have
    abandoned women facing such serious health· risks.
    ?        The procedure described in the bill troubles the President
    deeply.   He does not support use of that procedure on an
    elective basis. He would allow it only where necessary to
    save the. life of the mother or prevent serious injury to her
    health.
    ?        This bill went too far because it would have banned use of the
    procedure even when it was the only or best hope of averting a
    serious threat to a woman's health, including her ability to
    have children in the future.   The bill provided an exception
    only when a doctor could be certain that a woman's life was in
    jeopardy -- not when the doctor was sure that she faced real,
    grave risks to her health.
    ?        Before vetoing this bill, the President heard from women who
    desperately wanted babies, who were devastated to learn that
    their babies had fatal conditions, who wanted anything other
    than an abortion, but who were advised by their doctors that
    this procedure was their best hope of preventing death or
    grave harm, including the loss of reproductive ability.    For
    these women and others,' this was not about choice.  These
    babies were certain to perish before, during, or shortly after
    birth, and the only question was how much grave harm was going
    to be done to the woman.
    ?        It was because of tragic situations such as these that the
    President implored Congress to add an exemption to the bill
    for the small number of cases where selection of the
    procedure, in the medical judgment of the physician, is
    necessary either to preserve .the life of the woman or to avert
    serious adverse consequences to her health.   The President
    would have signed such a bill the moment it reached his desk.

    ?          The charge that the Pres.ident's proposed exemption would


  '.
create a huge loophole, allowing the widespread use of this
procedure, is not true,  Under the President's proposal, the
procedure could be used only where necessary to avert serious
harm to health, and in no other case.  Surely it is not beyond
the ingenuity of Congress, working with the Administration, to
write legislation making clear that serious harm to health

means just that -- that it doesn't include fraudulent or minor
health complaints, nor does it include, as some have
suggested, youth, low income, or inconvenience. Moreover,
such a limited exception would not make the bill more
vulnerable to constitutional challenge, as some have claimed;
indeed, the exact opposite is the case.
?       As to the charge that this procedure is never most appropriate
as a matter of medical practice, the best answer comes from
the medical community itself, which broadly supports the use
of the procedure where a woman's serious health interests are
at stake.  In those rare cases, the President believes that
the woman's doctor should have the ability to determine, in
the best exercise of medical judgment, that the procedure is
indeed necessary.
