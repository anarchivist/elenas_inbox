TEXT:
Lois Schiffer called to say that a district court in Washington yesterday
ordered oral argument for this afternoon in a case involving six more timber
sales.  As I understand it, four of these sales are under a prior injunction
issued by che Washington district court; the other two, although not themselves
under the injunction,  were withdrawn as a direct consequence of its issuance.
Schiffer thinks we might have a ruling on whether the government must also
release these six sales as early as today.  I asked her to start compiling,
along with the rest of the things she's supposed to be putting together, an
inventory of these sales as well.
