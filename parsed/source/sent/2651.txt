Subject: Deadlines

I work very hard to ensure that everybody is given significant lead time
on projects that our due. As you know, when I screw up, I take the
blame. And there have been times when I have made mistakes on timing.
However, I feel most of the kinks have been worked out of the system and
other offices, particularly the press office, have been good lately at
giving us significant advance notice for POTUS press conferences.
Therefore, it is disappointing, and embarrasing that we are slipping in
meeting some of these deadlines. We can't expect other White House
Offices to cooperate with us if we don't meet our deadlines.

Now I know everyone is overworked, and people are putting in very late
hours. You know how much Bruce appreciates your hard work, and we
encourage you to take time off. We are also willing to tell other offices
to back off when you need us to, you just have to ask.  But, when I give a
deadline and say no exceptions, I mean it.  I don't do that lightly, and
people know me well enough that I don't mince words. And when L·aura gives
a deadline, you should assume it is on behalf of Bruce, Elena, Chris, and
myself. Don't give her excuses for missing a deadline.   If you have
problems with deadlines, come talk to me.

Here are some reminders:

Press guidance is due to Elena by 10:30.  The press office must have it by
11:00. NO EXCEPTIONS. Joe can't answer questions without guidance.    Put
other things aside if you have to but get the guidance to Elena by 10:30
am through Laura.

Weekly Reports -- This is our best opportunity to influence POTUS
decision-making. The reports are due at 5:00 pm on Thursday to Laura.
Both Elena and I have to edit this document significantly and we need time
to do so.

Daily Guidance -- I want to remind everyone that they should notify Bruce
or Elena of important issues prior to the morning senior staff meetings.
Page them with a quick note.  But make certain they get the information
they need.

Thanks for your cooperation in advance.
