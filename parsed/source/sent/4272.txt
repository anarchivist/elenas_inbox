A BILL

To prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer, to provide
for further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of somatic cell
nuclear transfer in human beings, and for other purposes.

Th£..nhrase "atteillQLl9 create a human being" cou.ld be interrm;tcd by certain factiQns 0.:' an
attcmpt to create an embryo, although this distinction is cleared up in the prohibitions section.

SECTION 1. Short Title

This Act may be cited as the "Prohibition on Cloning of Human Beings Act of 1998".

This title is succinct and accurate, unlike the titles of other bills, such as the "Human Cloning
Prohibition Act" which could imply prohibition of inadyertent twinning of some infertility
treaUncnls.

SEC. 2. Findings

This section accurately recounts the findings of the NBAC on cloning.

SEC. 3. Purposes.

It is the purpose of this Act to-
         (i) prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer
cloning; and
         (2) provide for further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of
somatic cell nuclear transfer in humans.

Once :Hmin, thc phrase "attempt to create          ::1   human being" could be interpreted by certain factions

SEC. 4. Definitions.

In this Act:
         (i) Cloning- the production of a precise genetic copy of a molecuie (including DNA),
cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

Some scientists might argue th(1t cloning is not a "precise" genetic cop v, due to the invariable
m~t'!L'-C:.?Jnade in.[t:Ql\£.ill.!ggJ2.liA,..QmLs.Qllle wO!Ll~LllIg!Je that a human is an animal. but this
definition does not pose any negative implications for research.




                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

          (3) Oocyte-the female germ cell, the egg.

Would this definition include immature oocvtes? If it did not. this could possibly allow somati«
cc1lnuc1ear transfer to create a human being to take place with an immature oocyte.

          (4) Somatic cell-a mature, diploid cell.

Not entirelv clear what "mature" means. [fit nicans "differentiated" this would allow somatic
cell nuclear transfer to creale a human being using an undifferentiated embryo celL which could

        (5) Somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of an existing
or previously existing human child or adult into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been
removed.

of this technologv to treat infertility due to mitochondrial defects. Perhaps a small point of

SEC. 5. Prohibition.

It shall be unlawful for any person or other legal entity, public or private, to implant or attempt to
implant the product of s011}atic cell nuclear transfer into· a woman's uterus.

This prohibition clearly states the scientific intent of the legislation. and avoids the question of

or an attempt at action, which is easy to assess. rather than an "intent'" to act. This ,','ould protect
researchers and others [rom being second·gucssed about their intentions. 'This would allow the
J2fivate sector to u~e somatic cell nuclear transfer technologv to develo[l therapeutic cell lines for
the treatment of many disorders via 1iSSlle transplantation. If the definition of somatic cell is
interpreted as a differentiated diploid cell, and if"existing human child" is not interpreted to

snch a product to an animal's uterus.

SEC. 6. Protected Biomedical Research.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict areas of biomedical and agricultural research or



                                                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
        (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to clone
molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues; or
        (2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals.

that may not hc considered research. Allowing the usc of this technology "to clone molecules.
 DNA, cells, and tissues" would allow the priv3te sector to plLrsue this technology to develop
therapeutic tissues .;'!s mentioned above. Allowing the use of this technologv to «reate anil)lals
will allow the continuation of a thriving research base in animal husbandrv and transgenic
animals for the production of therapeutic products and animal models. ]-Iowever. as mentioned

SEC. 7. Penalties.
        (a) In General-Any person who intentionally violates the provision of section 5 shall be
fined the greater of $250,000 or 2 times the gross pecuniary gain or loss resulting from the
violation. .
        (b) Civil Actions-If a person is violating or about to violate the provisions of section 5,
the Attorney General may commence a civil action in an appropriate Federal district court to
enjoin such violation.
        (c) Forfeiture-any property, real or personal, derived from or used to commit a violation
or attempted violation of the provisions of section 5, or any property traceable to such property,
shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States in accordance with the procedures set forth in
chapter 46 of title 18, U.S. Code.
        (D) Authority-The Attorney General shall have exclusive, nondelegable enforcement
authority under this Act.
        (E) Advisory Opinions-The Attorney General shall, upon request, render binding
advisory opinions regarding the scope, applicability, interpretation, and enforcement of this Act
with regard to specific research projects or practices.

This section uscs phrases such as "attempted violation." The prohibition already includes the
attempt to implant the product to a uterus. Would this then allo\v civil actions or forfeitures of
~Jtempts at at!gmpts" ambyould this lead to th'?Q.iffisult Q..uestl9J1.J1J illtention_~_.cll1 areseareher's
part?

SEC. 8. Cooperation with Foreign Countries.
       It is the sense of Congress that the President should cooperate with foreign countries to
enforce mutually supported restrictions on the activities prohibited under section 5.

SEC. 9. National Bioethics Advisory Commission Report.

      Not later than 4 Y2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the National Bioethics
Advisory Commission shall prepare and submit to the President a report concerning-
      (1) the state of the science of somatic cell nuclear transfer;
      (2) the ethical and social issues associated with the potential use of this technology in



                                                                                                                     Automated Records Management System

      (3) the advisability of continuing the prohibition established in the Act.

       The Commission is authorized to continue for the 1O-year period described in section 12
to prepare such a report and for other purposed as established in Executive order 122975 and

             i. Cloning--the production of a precise genetic copy of a molecule (including DNA), cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

             ii. Somatic cell--any cell of the body other than germ cells (eggs or sperm.)

             iii. Somatic cell nuclear transfer--the transfer of a cell nucleus from a somatic cell into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed.

             iv.Cloning-the production of a precise genetic copy of a molecule (including DNA), cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

             v.Nucleus-the cell structure that houses the chromosomes, and thus the genes.


             vi.Oocyte-the female germ cell, the egg.

             vii.Somatic cell-a mature, diploid cell.

             viii. Somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of an existing or previously existing human child or adult into an oocyte from which the nucleus has
             been removed.

             ix. Human somatic cell nuclear transfer-- transferring the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert.

             x. Somatic cell--a cell of an embryo, fetus, child, or adult which is not and will not become a sperm or egg cell.

             xi. Embryo-The developing organism from the time of fertilization, or from the time of the single cell stage at the inception of growth and development of an organism, until
             significant differentiation has occurred.


             xii.Human somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert.

             xiii. Oocyte-the mature female germ cell, the egg.

xiv.Somatic cell-any cell of an embryo, fetus, child, or adult that is not a germ cell or is not destined to become a germ cell.

xv. Clone & Cloning-the practice of creating or attempting to create a human being by transferring the nucleus from a human clel from whatever source into a human cell from
which the nucleus has been removed for the purpose of, or to implant, the resulting product to initiate a pregnancy that could result in the birth of a human being.
