Subject:         UI Conference Call

Jill pizzuto said you asked what the UI conference call was about.        Here's
a short (and maybe cryptic) summary of what I believe Ken wants to
accomplish.

·We have been having trouble getting the UI proposals in the FY 1998 Budget
 included by the W&M folks in reconciliation.  The purpose of the
 conference call is to assess where we stand on this issue as of Friday,
 but primarily to decide if we need to assemble a team to carry the message
 to the Hill.

The principle issue is "UI Integrity".  This proposal is modeled on the
Continuing Disability Review (CDR) proposal adopted a few years ago. In
the UI proposal, we request additional UI State admin funds for better
oversight of tax collection and benefit eligibility (i.e., "integrity")
and realize mandatory savings through increased UI revenues and more
accurate (lower) UI benefit expenditures that more than offset the
discretionary BA request.
