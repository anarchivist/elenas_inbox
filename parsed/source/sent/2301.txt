Karen--I thought you all had reconvened to work on the reform package.
The President indicated in response to the memo that DPC sent in that he
didn't really need a meeting--he just wanted to be sure that we were
working on a real set of reforms, he doesn't want some mushy stuff, but
real concrete ideas for getting results for these kids--I believe Mike is
working on this--You had suggested that we should be expanding our
consultations--cast a wider net--do you have some thoughts in mind--I
think it's a good idea, I'll help in whatever way you think I can.   I'll
check in with Mike as to where we're at--he expects a follow up memo
detailing the reform package--we obviously have to see how the House takes
up this issue when they get back.  talk to you.
