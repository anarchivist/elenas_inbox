TEXT:
i think Mike's memo is extremely good. I wouldn't worry much about length
-- I think the state-by-state summary, which takes up the largest chunk of
the meno, is quite valuable.  I would add our proposal for modifying Chaka
Fattah(sp?) to give a lift to our standards effort.  There clearly are
people around here who will be arguing that we should propose incentives
for states to adopt our tests; Mike's proposal, aside from its other
merits, is a way to make these people into our allies, rather than our opp
onents. The weakest part of the memo is that dealing with communications
strategy. Does Don have any good ideas on this score? I think we might
need more of a general description of our communications strategy -- not
just ideas for discrete events, but an overall plan for recapturing the
media's (and the publci's) interest.
