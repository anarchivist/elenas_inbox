TEXT:
As I told you this morning, Bruce and I would like to hold a regular
meeting -- say, every couple of weeks -- on racial issues, including
affirmative action. We had started to plan our first such meeting and had
talked about it to Jack, Cheryl, Maggie, and Rahm.  As some appointments
are made (particularly to replace Deval), we thought we would add some
agency people. And of course, we'd love participation from you or anyone
else in the Chief of Staff's office. We think a regular meeting of this
kind would contribute to fashioning a coordinated and strong policy (and
message) on racial matters.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
