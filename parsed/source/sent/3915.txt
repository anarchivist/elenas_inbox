Subject:         tobacco call

Should we schedule a conference call for tomorrow afternoon to review our
game plan for Friday? With:

Us
Rahm
Melissa
Jim O'Hara, FDA
George Phillips, DOJ
Bruce Lindsey if he wants
VP's office
Barry Toiv or other WH press

Does that make sense?     Anyone else to include?
