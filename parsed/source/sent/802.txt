TEXT:
Would you let them know that 'OPC doesn't have any substantive comments,
but that the question of when the report will be released (i.e., whether
it should be released at the brain conf on the 17th) is still an open
one? thanks.

OSTP is planning to release the kids research report April 17 at an
"event," per a voice mail they left for me so is urgently trying to get
DPC clearance. Note that the report gives DPC a specific role in research
planning -- other than noting that, I haven't reviewed it either.
