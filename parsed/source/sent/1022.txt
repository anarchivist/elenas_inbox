      Dear [whomever]:

              As America moves into the 21st Century, we must give our poeple the strongest
      education in the world. No other priority is more important for our nation. I cannot sign any
      legislation that would hinder our mission of raising standards and giving every American child a
      world-class education. Therefore, I will veto the supplemental appropriations bill if it includes
      the proposed amendment that seeks to block national educational standards.

              As I said in my State-of-the-Union Address, America needs educational standards -- not
      federal government standards, but national standards reperesenting what all our students must
      know to succeed in the new knowledge economy. Every state and school must shape its
      curriculum to reflect these standards, and train teachers to lift students up to them. I have
      proposed that every state should test 4th graders in reading, and 8th graders in math, based on
      widely accepted national standards. These tests are already used to measure the performance of
      states; what we propose is that they measure the performance of every student, so parents can
      learn how their children are doing and how their own schools measure up. The Department of
      Education is already funding the development of these tests. Make no mistake: The proposed
      am~ndment would stop in its tracks this national, cooperative effort to develop meaningful tests.
                                                                                   ,
              Education is the key to our future, and national standards are the key to improving
      education. The proposed amendment would effectively block these national standards. It would
      set back the cause of education and damage the future of our children. It must not become law.

              I am determined that all our young people will meet these new rigorous standards. That
      is why, for example, I am so pleased that the recent budget agreement funds our America Reads
      challenge, which would mobilize an army of I million volunteer tutors toward our goal of every
      8 year old being able to read independently. We must press forward with other ongoing efforts to
      help our children learn the basics of reading and math, and I look forward to working with you in
      partnership toward these critical national goals. But above all, I will not allow our nation to
      come to a halt as we move toward effective national standards.

              As you are also aware, I have made clear that I will veto this legislation if it incldues the
      automatic continuing resolution provision contained in the senate passed bill. While I share the
      goal of ensuring that Congress does not shut the governemnt down again, such a provision is
      inconsistent with our recent bipartisan budget agreement, and is clearly extraneous to this
      emergency disaster relief legislation.

              In addition, members of my administration have informed you of other seriously
      objectionable provisions that must be addressed before this legislation reaches my desk.

               This vital legislation containst $5.6 billion in ugently needed disaster assistance funds for
      hundreds of thousands of victims of recent natural disasters in 33 states. These citizens should
      not be forced to wait. I urge you to pass strong disaster relief and international peacekeeping
      supplemental funding, without attaching unrelated and damaging provisions that can only set this
      legislation back.

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
