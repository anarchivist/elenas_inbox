Tracey-

will you work with DPC on the late-term Qs&As for the press conference?
Also, do the last Qs&AS on Comp/Flex time need to be updated?

POTUS is holding a press conference next Tuesday, March 4.  We've been
asked to get the briefing book in to staff secretary by tomorrow night.

Please email me your TPs by tomorrow at 3pm so I can get them to staff


secretary by their 4pm deadline.

We can use the TPs from yesterday's press conference briefing book
let me know what we can just reuse and I cna just slip it in.  But I'm
sure we'll need some updates.  We also should add "don't ask, don't tell"
and abortion (is that OPC for both, Elena?)

And Leg affairs should work with OPC to come up with camapign finance
(last time we had 2 sets). Thanks - - I am at 62712.
