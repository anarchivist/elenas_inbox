We continued our discussions today with Senators McCain and Hollings, and
believe we now have the outlines of an agreement; over the next few days,
we will work with McCain's and Hollings' staff to incorporate it in a
manager's amendment.  As we described yesterday, we have improved the bill
in key areas: strengthened lookback penalties, a tougher ETS provision, a
higher liability cap and the elimination of other liability protections,
and a narrowed antitrust exemption.  Notwithstanding these improvements,
some Senators have objected to our anticipated agreement with McCain,
arguing that it will undermine their ability to pass strengthening
amendments on the floor.  Erskine spoke to the Caucus today and explained
that we wanted to strengthen the bill as much as we could before it gets
to the floor, given the fairly low probability of passing Democratic
amendments there.
