TEXT:
Just a short note responding to one point in Ellen Seidman's e-mail:
Levitt indeed represented that the second circuit standard incorporated a
specificity requirement.  When I asked Mark Gittenstein and Andy(?) Pincus last
njght for any second circuit cases recognizing such a requirement, they could
not find any, but they did send me Levitt's statement.
