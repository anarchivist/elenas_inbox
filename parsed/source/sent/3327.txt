TEXT:
Alan Kreczko and I talked to Jack this past week about the Jerusalem provision
in the foreign ops bill and your suggestion for how to deal with it.  Jack
wanted to speak with Tony Lake or Sandy Berger before he (or anyone else) went
up to see Lieberman.  I will check on Monday as to whether he's done this.
Meantime, where's the bill? Is there anything else I need to know?
