Subject:         Re: Utah education officials

I met Friday morning with 2 people from the Utah Department of Education
who are responsible for the administration of their school lands, as well
as someone from the Utah affiliate of the National Education Association.

They presented a lengthy history of school lands in Utah, and their
efforts to generate more funds for education from them than has been the
case in the past.  I listened attentively.  Their bottom line is that they
would like to work out a way to swap the school lands inside the national
monument for other school lands either inside or outside the monument
(they seem to have an endless supply of options for this).  They claim it
is possible to do this and meet the Administration's environmental
purposes while at the same time generating the revenue they believe they
need and are entitled to.

I suggested to the Utah delegation that it would be appropriate -- and far
more productive -- for them to meet with CEQ officials.  They agreed, and
I promised to try and set up such a meeting.  Kathleen and Tom -- are you
willing to meet with them? How would you like to proceed?
