MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 Federal Tobacco Claims

       Over the last few months, we and Bruce Lindsey have had many conversations with
Department of Justice attorneys regarding the feasibility of bringing suit against the tobacco
companies for Medicare and other losses stemming from the use of tobacco products. We also
have asked DO] lawyers to consult with a number of law professors and trial attorneys who have
considered the viability of a lawsuit.

        The Department now has concluded that it should not bring suit against the companies.
Almost everyone at DO] agrees that such a suit could be brought consistent with Rule 11 (i.e.,
with minimum professional standards). Most DO] lawyers also acknowledge that given the size
of the claim and other factors, the companies might well choose to settle the suit (as they are
settling state claims) for a substantial sum of money plus public health concessions. DO]
attorneys believe, however, that they should not bring suit unless they would stand a reasonable
prospect of actually winning the suit at trial and on appeal (i.e., putting aside all settlement
possibilities). The attorneys have concluded that urider existing law governing Medicare and
other potential federal claims, they cannot meet this standard. The lawyers principally argue that
current law precludes the federal government from aggregating (i.e., bringing in a single suit)
claims for each Medicare beneficiary's tobacco-related health care costs.

         At the same time, most DO] attorneys appear amenable to settling federal claims against
the tobacco companies without bringing a prior lawsuit. (The lawyers reason that although they
cannot bring suit against the companies for want of an effective aggregation device, they do in
fact have millions of individual claims against the companies, which they could settle all at
once.) Under this approach, the government would enter into negotiations with the tobacco
companies to resolve potential federal claims; if an agreement were reached, the parties would
file in court a settlement agreement and proposed consent decree, which would release federal
claims against the tobacco companies in exchange for some combination of monetary damages
and injunctive relief. No legislation would be necessary.

        We have some reason to believe that the companies -- at least Phillip Morris and Lorillard
-- would have an interest in entering into this kind of negotiation in the wake of a settlement with
the states (which, as you know, is rumored to be in the offing). The principal outside counsel for
Phillip Morris (Meyer Koplow) recently suggested to Elena that hi:s client wants to resolve all


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                       2

     government claims against it, including potential claims by the federal government. He implied
     that a potential settlement agreement could include money, FDA jurisdiction, and marketing
     restrictions.

             The prospects of actually reaching a good agreement with the companies are uncertain.
     We know that the companies want to rid themselves of potential government litigation, primarily
     so they can spin off non-tobacco assets. But without an actual suit against the companies, we
     would have relatively little leverage in negotiations. Moreover, we could encounter serious legal
     difficulties in trying to achieve some of our objectives -- particularly, an assurance of FDA
     jurisdiction -- through a non-legislated settlement.




                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
