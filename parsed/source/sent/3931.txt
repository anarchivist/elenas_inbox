New information.    New states definitely endorsing our tests are:

West Virginia
Kentucky
Vermont
Massachusetts
Missouri

New states possibly endorsing our tests are:

New York
New Jersey

We believe that all these states, other than West Virginia and Kentucky, will
be in session on May 19. But we should check with intergovernmental.   Emily??
