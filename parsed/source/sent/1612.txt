        This Administration is committed to taking effective action to prevent youth access to
tobacco. The FDA rule contains numerous provisions to limit youth access, including
establishing 18 as the federal minimum age of sale, requiring retailers to check photo
identification of anyone under 27, and eliminating free samples and the sale of single cigarettes.
These provisions will help parents to keep their children safe from tobacco products.

        The Administration supports legislation that will advance this effort still further. This
legislation, in addition to incorporating access restrictions from the FDA rule, shall ban all
cigarette vending machines and require tobacco products to be placed out of reach of consumers
in any facility that children may enter.

        In addition and even more important, the Administration supports legislation to establish
an effective licensing scheme to enforce these access restrictions. This scheme shall prohibit any
unlicensed person from selling tobacco products to consumers; institute a strict scheme of
criminal and civil penalties, including license suspension or revocation, for violations of
licensing laws; and impose licensing fees to cover the costs of administering the licensing
system.

        The Administration will work with Congress on the appropriate distribution of
responsibility between the federal and state governments for administering this scheme and
imposing penalties. In addition, the Administration will work with Congress on the appropriate
level of penalties for violating licensing laws, including by selling tobacco products to minors.
These penalties cannot impinge on any existing powers of the FDA to impose civil penalties and
must be sufficiently stringent to deter violations; in particular, the threshold for permanently
revoking licenses should not be set so high as to lost its power to deter retailers from selling
tobacco to mino·rs.



Internal notes:

        The above statement embraces the settlement's provisions on youth access restrictions.
These provisions, which codify and then go beyond the FDA rule, significantly advance the effort
to limit youth access to tobacco products.

       Even more important to that effort is the provision for establishing a retail licensing
system. FDA and Treasury agree that such a system is necessary for adequate enforcement of
youth access provisions. Assuming adequate funding, legislation creating a licensing system
would count as one of the principal virtues of the settlement agreement.

        The proposed settlement is vague as to who -- state authorities, federal authorities, or
some combination of the two -- should administer the licensing scheme. We are not yet in a
position to make a concrete recommendation on this question. FDA's current inclination is to



                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion

give responsibility for running the scheme to the states, but to retain the power to revoke
licenses. We are not sure whether such an approach would work (or even how it could be done);
the above statement therefore says only that we will work with Congress on this issue.

         The statement also indicates that the penalty structure attached to the licensing scheme
needs further thought and strengthening, but does not now commit ourselves to a particular set of
penalties. The statement includes language about preserving FDA authority as a safeguard, in
light ofthe settlement's failure to make this point explicit. More meaningfully, the statement
suggests that the penalty scheme set out in the settlement is too lenient. The settlement provides
for permarient license revocation only after a licensee's tenth offense within two years. Because
licensing officials are unlikely to conduct tcn compliance checks on a single retailer in a two-year
time frame, this provision is essentially meaningless. The above statement indicates that we
want mandatory revocation to be a real weapon, without getting into a level of detail unsuitable
at this stage of the process.




                                                       Automated Records Management System

         The Administration understands that separate and apart from any legislation, the tobacco
industry will voluntarily agree in consent decrees and contracts to restrict its advertising and
marketing of tobacco products. These voluntary limitations will include but go beyond
restrictions imposed by the FDA in its August 1996 rule.                          .

        Notwithstanding these agreements, the Administration will press for legislative language
that confirms the FDA's authority to regulate the advertising and marketing of tobacco products,
as asserted in its August 1996 rule. The Administration will carefully review any legislative
language relating or referring to the industry's consent decrees or contracts to ensure that such
language does not limit or in any way interfere with the FDA's use of this authority. The
Administration also will carefully review such language to ensure consistency with constitutional
requirements.

        The Administration supports legislation to require "Canadian-style" warning labels -- i.e.,
strengthened warnings (such as "cigarettes cause cancer" and "smoking can kill you") that appear
on 25% of the front or display panel of tobacco products, printed in alternating black-on-white or
white-on-black type. The Administration also supports legislation to require warnings of similar
prominence on advertisements for tobacco products.



Internal notes:

         The advertising and marketing restrictions in the settlement are very strong. They include
all the restrictions in the FDA rule -- most notably, requirements of black-on-white advertising
and bans on tobacco brand names in non-tobacco merchandise. The district court struck down
these restrictions as inconsistent with the FDA's statutory authority. The Court of Appeals
clearly will not reverse this decision, and the Supreme Court probably will leave it alone as well.
 The settlement also includes restrictions on advertising and marketing going far beyond the FDA
rule, such as restrictions on point-of-sale advertising and bans on outdoor advertising, Internet
advertising, the use of human images and cartoon characters, and payments for tobacco product
placement in movies and other media. Congress could not enact such restrictions consistent with
the Constitution.

         The above statement is written to emphasize that the restrictions on advertising are part of
consent decrees and other contracts -- not part of our proposed legislation. To the extent the
restrictions are a part of the legislation -- or seen as a condition of the legislation -- serious
constitutional issues will arise. To the extent the restrictions are a part only of the settlement
agreements, they probably will be permissible as voluntary relinquishments of rights.

       The statement insists on statutory confirmation of FDA authority over the advertising and
marketing of tobacco products. This grant of authority is valuable even though the settlement
agreements go further than the FDA could, because the FDA will have no authority to enforce the



                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

contracts between the industry and the states. With a specific grant of authority, the FDA itself
could enforce the restrictions contained in its 1996 rule, as well as any other constitutionally
permissible restrictions it might wish to impose in the future.

         The statement contemplates that the legislation may refer to the consent decrees. Such a
reference could make sense to bolster enforcement of the agreements, to include them within a
broader severance scheme (~, what happens if a court invalidates part of an agreement?), or for
certain other reasons. The statement, however, makes clear that the Administration will carefully
scrutinize any reference of this kind to ensure that it does not interfere with FDA authority -- and
more important, to ensure that it does not bring the advertising restrictions so far within the
legislative scheme as to increase their vulnerability to constitutional challenge.

        The part of the statement relating to labels on packages and advertisements is consistent
with the provisions of the settlement agreement. These provisions would strengthen significantly
the existing warning labels, both in the starkness of the message and in its size and placement on
tobacco products.

        For decades, the tobacco industry has failed to disclose essential facts in its possession
about the dangers and addictiveness of tobacco products. hideed, the tobacco companies have
used the attorney-client and/or work-product privileges to cloak scientific research and findings
-- and to shield evidence of the companies' criminal or fraudulent behavior. It is therefore
necessary to establish an effective and speedy mechanism to pierce fraudulent or otherwise
improper claims of privilege and to force the disclosure of information that will advance public
health interests.

        The Administration supports legislation to create a national tobacco document depository
and require tobacco companies to tum over immediately all documents (including assertedly
privileged documents and detailed privilege logs) relating to the health effects of tobacco
products, the use of nicotine in those products, and the sale or marketing of those products to
children. Companies may not claim privilege in this process for any descriptions or analyses of
scientific research conducted or paid for by the company. [Correct phrasing?] A three-person
Board, appointed consistent with the Constitution, shall review documents claimed to be
privileged -- including through an expedited process allowing any person, without a prima facie
showing, to challenge a privilege claim -- shall disclose any document found not to be privileged
(with that determination binding on the company), and may impose appropriate monetary
sanctions.

        Under the legislation, this administrative process will not be the only means to contest a
claim of privilege. Any person can challenge a claim of privilege in a legal action against a
tobacco company, even if the Board of the depository has upheld or failed to rule on the claim.
In addition, the administrative process will not govern the disclosure of documents to the FDA.
Companies must disclose to the FDA all documents containing information about the health
effects or addictive qualities of tobacco products, regardless of any claim of privilege. [Correct
phrasing?]



Internal notes:

        The proposal outlined above strengthens the document disclosure provisions of the
settlement in several ways. First, the proposal makes the administrative disclosure process non-
exclusive, so that a litigant can challenge a privilege claim in a lawsuit, even if the Board of the
depository has not completed its review or has ruled in favor of the company. (By contrast, a
Board finding that a document is not privileged binds the company in all other proceedings.)
Second, the proposal provides the FDA with access to all health-related documents,
notwithstanding any claims of privilege. Third, the proposal somewhat broadens the category of
materials for which companies cannot claim a privilege in the administrative process. hi
addition, the proposal as outlined here gives us some wiggle-room on details -- relating, for
example, to the composition of the Board (which the Justice Department believes is
unconstitutional as written) and the procedures that the Board will follow.



                                                             Automated Records Management System

        The proposal, however, does not broadly abrogate the attorney-client or work-product
privileges, as Rep. Waxman's proposed legislation would do. The Justice Department has
expressed serious concerns about any broad abrogation of the privilege, arguing that such an
approach would undermine the privilege generally and would enable a tobacco company official
charged with criminal conduct to assert a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective
assistance of counsel. But some public health groups may demand the abrogation of the
companies' attorney-client privilege in a settlement -- or, even more broadly, insist (as Sen ..
Leahy, Rep. Waxman, and Attorney General Skip Humphrey have done) that the tobacco
companies disclose all privileged documents before any consideration of a settlement takes place.

        The best available scientific evidence indicates that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
causes disease and death. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies ETS as a Class
A carcinogen [check) and estimates that it is responsible for about 3,000 lung cancer deaths each
year in non-smoking adults. The EPA also has found that ETS threatens the health of hundreds
of thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illnesses. The Surgeon General, in a
study concluding that ETS causes serious disease among non-smokers, determined that simple
separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same airspace may reduce, but does not
eliminate harmful exposure to ETS.

        For these reasons, the Administration supports legislation to restrict smoking in
workplaces and other public facilities. This legislation, like the President's recent Executive
Order on tobacco smoke in federal facilities, shall ban smoking in public places or at work
except in enclosed areas exhausted directly to the outside. The legislation may include
appropriate but limited exceptions to this ban, as in H.R. 3434, for prisons and the hospitality
industry (but not including fast food restaurants). The legislation shall not preempt or otherwise
affect any federal, state, or local law, regulation, or rule that imposes stricter limitations on ETS.
 The legislation shall ensure that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration possesses all
necessary (including all currently existing) authority to regulate and enforce the law in this area.



Internal notes:

       The above statement is essentially consistent with the proposed settlement's provision on
ETS. This provision is one of the most valuable aspects ofthe settlement, given the risk ofETS
to non-smokers, the success ofETS measures in inducing smokers to quit (or at least cut down),
and the political difficulty of making headway on this issue without the tacit consent of the
tobacco companies.

        The only major question in this area is whether to exempt the hospitality industry (and if
so, what parts of the industry) from the ban on indoor smoking. The proposed settlement
exempts restaurants (but not fast food restaurants), bars, private clubs, hotel guest rooms,
casinos, bingo parlors, and tobacco merchants. H.R. 3434, which the Administration has
supported, exempts restaurants (including fast food restaurants) and bars. The proposed rule on
ETS that OSHA issued in 1994 does not include any exemption for the hospitality industry. (In a
number of other ways, however, the settlement is more protective of the public health than the
OSHA rule, which in any event would face serious legal challenges if finally issued.) DOL
recommends accepting the exception in the settlement; HHS recommends eliminating the
exception. The above statement retains an exception, leaves some wiggle room with respect to
its precise scope, but hints that it would cover only bars and non-fast food restaurants.

        On another point, the above statement will enable us to inspect legislative language
carefully to ensure that it does not (1) preempt any more health-protective laws, whether federal,




                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion

state, or local, or (2) deprive OSHA of any necessary regulatory or enforcement authority.
Current language in the settlement creates some ambiguities with respect to these issues.




                                                           Automated Records Management System

        The first priority of the Administration, in considering any tobacco legislation, shall be to
confirm and protect the jurisdiction of the FDA to regulate tobacco products. This authority can
be no less strong -- though because of the nature of the product, it may be somewhat different --
than that which the FDA exercises over other drugs and devices. Further, the authority cannot be
circumscribed by any special procedural rules or requirements. The FDA must be able to
regulate tobacco products, including by ordering the reduction or elimination of nicotine or other
constituents, through its normal procedures in the furtherance of public health interests.

         The Administration therefore supports legislation specifically empowering the FDA to
require the modification of tobacco products based on a finding that this change would reduce the
risk of the product to the public and is technologically feasiblc. [Pick one of the following two
sentences:] [The FDA shall consider all relevant factors in making this determination, including
the number of addicted tobacco users, the availability of alternative products, and the risk of a
significant contraband market in tobacco products resulting from the proposed action.] [The FDA
need make no further findings in support of this decision, but consistent with its duty to protect
the public health, the FDA may not go forward if a party affirmatively demonstrates that the
action would create a significant contraband market in tobacco products.] The FDA may order a
modification of a tobacco product (including the reduction or elimination of nicotine) at any
time, although a decision to eliminate nicotine shall not take effect for two years to allow time
for congressional review. In determining whether to require modification of a tobacco product,
the FDA shall use its normal procedures.



Internal Notes:

           Even as written, the settlement's provision on FDA jurisdiction had significant virtues.
  First, the provision specifically conferred jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products on the FDA,
  thereby removing the legal uncertainty now attending the FDA rule. (The Fourth Circuit almost
. certainly will rule against the FDA; the Supreme Court is a toss-up.) Second, the provision
  established a "risk reduction" standard to guide the regulation of tobacco products in place ofthe
 "safety and efficacy" standard applicable to other drugs and devices. Because the former makes
  sense when applied to inherently dangerous products whereas the latter does not, the change in
  standard would facilitate the FDA's regulation ofto"bacco products.

         This provision of the settlement, however, also contained several glaring weaknesses.
First, the FDA was required to prove a negative in order to reduce or eliminate nicotine -- i.e.,
that the action would not create a significant demand for contraband products. Second, the FDA
could not eliminate nicotine for a period of 12 years. Third, the FDA could not take any action to
modify tobacco products without surmounting a number of procedural hurdles -- M" formal
rulemakings -- not usually applicable to administrative action.

        The above statement eliminates the 12-year prohibition and the special procedural hurdles

contained in the proposed settlement. The statement offers two alternatives on the contraband
issue. The first and preferable alternative is to convert the contraband question from a make-or-
break finding into a mere "consideration." The second alternative is to flip the burden of proof
on the contraband issue, so that the tobacco industry will have to prove that the proposed action
will create a contraband market (instead of the FDA having to prove that it will not). This
alternative removes the burden of proving a negative from the FDA, but still makes the FDA's
action wholly dependent on the question of whether it will create a contraband market.




                                                              Automated Records Management System

        In the event that Congress passes legislation meeting all ofthe Administration's demands
for punishing and regulating tobacco companies -- including a payment of more than $20 billion
[?] in punitive damages payable to the public -- the Administration will accept provisions barring
class actions and punitive damages for past misconduct and imposing yearly limits of $5 billion
on certain civil damages. The legislation itself will both exact penalties for past behavior and
regulate future behavior, while a significant pool of money (especially given the historic failure
of smokers to collect any damages) will be available to compensate injured plaintiffs.

        The Administration will oppose -- and will not accept legislation including -- any limits
on punitive damages for future misconduct. These damages shall not count toward or be subject
to yearly limits; tobacco companies shall pay the full amount of such damages over and above all
other payment obligations. The continued potential for unrestricted punitive damages will
support the regulatory aspects of the legislation in deterring willful misconduct and otherwise
changing corporate behavior.

        Also in the context of broader legislation, the Administration will support a provision that
gives tobacco companies an exemption from the antitrust laws, so long as that exemption is no
broader than necessary to accomplish its purpose -- reducing youth consumption of tobacco
products. The Administration will review the language of the exemption carefully to ensure that
it does not protect such activities as price-fixing, mergers to monopoly, predatory pricing, and
agreements not to produce reduced-risk products.

        The Administration respects recent efforts by states and localities to regulate tobacco
products, and it will oppose any changes in preemption law that would frustrate these efforts. In
the absence ofa strong justification, legislation therefore shall not affect the FDA's existing
authority to allow states and localities to impose requirements on tobacco products; nor shall
legislation preempt state-law tort suits or state and local requirements that are more stringent than
their federal counterparts.



Internal notes:

         The liability provisions are, of course, what the tobacco companies get out of the
proposed s~tt1ement. As written, they eliminate the possibility of a cataclysmic hitby limiting
total liability to $5 billion each year; and they diminish the likelihood of any successful lawsuits
by prohibiting class action and other joinder devices. The above statement takes a bit of the sting
out of these provisions by making clear that any punitive damages for future misconduct will not
be subject to the damages cap. (The statement is also silent about whether we would accept the
prohibition not only of class actions, but also of other joinder devices; the Justice Department has
some doubts about whether we should.) But there is little doubt about the value of the
provisions -- arising from the certainty they offer -- to the tobacco companies.




                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

         On the other hand, it is not at all clear that these provisions harm public health interests.
Instituting a comprehensive regulatory scheme, while keeping in place the possibility of capped
compensatory damages and uncapped punitive damages, should influence future corporate
behavior at least as well as the litigation system usually manages to do. Moreover, making the
companies pay a punitive damage award for past misconduct to the public (for use in health
research, etc.) makes far more sense from a public health perspective than allowing such funds to
go as windfalls to individual plaintiffs. Of course, these provisions do decrease the likelihood of
bankrupting the tobacco companies. But as long as Americans are addicted to tobacco products,
it is very unclear that this result would serve the public health; indeed, the exact opposite
argument is at least equally plausible.

        The FTC and antitrust division of the Justice Department are both concerned about the
breadth of the antitrust exemption contained in the proposed settlement agreement. They have
not come to closure on appropriate language, but agree that an exemption should allow collusion
to reduce youth smoking while prohibiting collusion for other purposes. The statement above
serves as a placeholder, indicating that the Administration will take a serious interest in the
drafting of this provision.                                     .

        The preemption provisions of the proposed settlement are among its most baffling aspects
-- muddled, internally contradictory, and seemingly senseless. The statement above essentially
favors a status quo approach (which the FDA favors): in circumstances where existing law
requires states to petition the FDA to regulate tobacco, states would remain under that obligation;
in circumstances where existing law allows states to regulate tobacco on their own, states could
impose any regulations more stringent than the new federal standards. It is very difficult to know
how much (if at all) this scheme deviates from what the drafters of the settlement intended.
