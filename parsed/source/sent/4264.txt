    Subject: IMPORTANT Clarification: Education Policy Rollout

    Clarification to the earlier email below: I don't mean to be critical of
    Elena -- I know she's got many more important things to do than yack with
    an interloping schmoozer. Life is complicated. But I'm trying to do what
    you've asked me to do.

Also: forgot to send this .to Minyon before.

Sylvia:

I've heard rumblings about impending rollout of the "no social promotions"
education policy within the next few days.

I have had no success contacting Elena to learn details or give feedback on
this policy. I have tried email, voice mail, hallway greeting, and
conversation with her secretary. I don't feel that I have standing to call·
yet again and be a pest.

HOWEVER: Like the Voluntary National Test of 4th and 8th grade students,
there are serious substantive and political pitfalls. The VNT was flawed
from the start, which I told everyone who would listen, and which is one
reason the liberals and minority caucuses decided to get in bed with the
GOP to attack the policy. It's not about standards, its about safeguards to
prevent abuses of powerless poor and minority kids. (And, let me add, when
in June and July I raised these issues with Secretary Riley and the
President, they expressed a great deal of concern, both substantive and
political. If indeed they had been presented with the information and
perspective I offered prior to adopting the VNT, they either dudn't recall
it, had not been given a fair sense of the weight of those concerns, or
gave me Academy Award performances.)

 The basic substantive question is whether the safeguards are merely
 hortatory (my suspicion) or are central and mandatory. I am fearful,
 because on a wide range of social welfare issues, the Administration has
 been very reluctant to impose regulatory strings.

 It is also important to anticipate and answer the objections many moderate
 and liberal researchers will raise. For example, students who fall 2 years
 behind their age cohort in grade have something like a 98 percent HS drop
 out rate; does that matter, and if so, how is your concern reflected in the
 design of this policy?

 Sylvia, I made a mistake in not making earlier, vigorous objections to all
 the visibility the White House bestowed on Abigail Thernstrom, when other
 more resesponsible conservative voices are available. Then, in a box, I
 felt the need to go on the record with reporters expressing my dismay. That
 was an awkward thing for me to do, and I'm sure many at the White House
 resented it.  But it I felt compelled to do it, since I'm not on the staff
 and the terms of our arrangement were that I would keep my own voice, but
 be judicious.  My work with the National Research Council and civil rights
 groups on the VNT began before consultancy with you on the race
 initiative.

 This rollout of a social promotion policy I know virtually nothing about
 holds the potential to create a third and far more serious problem for me,
 because the issue goes to the core of opportunity issues about which I care
 so deeply. I hope we can find a process that will get me comfortable with
 whatever you are planning to do, and thereby avoid the problem of deciding
 (together) whether I need to resign.
