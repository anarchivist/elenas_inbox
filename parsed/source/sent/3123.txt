TEXT:
Jack: Can you come to this? It would be great if you could -- and if we could
talk about the timber situation a bit beforehand.                      The precise issue here
concerns a list of pre-1990 timber sales that DOJ is supposed to submit to the
district court tomorrow.                      (The court hasn't yet decided whether to force the
government to release those sales.)                      Some around the White House (most notably,
Martha Foley) want DOJ to ask for further time before submitting the list; DOJ
(assuming it has the info it needs from the agencies) doesn't want to delay any
further.           More generally, there seems to be a battle royal shaping up over DOJ
litigation strategy. As you know, many people were pissed off on Friday; that
anger doesn't seem to be going away.                      Let me know if you can come. Thanks.
Elena
