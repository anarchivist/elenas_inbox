     FDA Authority

          . The first priority of the Administration in considering tobacco legislation should be to
     confinn and protect the jurisdiction of the FDA to regulate tobacco products -- including through
     the reduction or elimination of nicotine or other constituents. This goal will necessitate
     substantial changes in the proposed settlement agreement.

              Even as written, the settlement's provision on FDA jurisdiction had certain virtues. First,
     the provision specifically conferred jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products on the FDA, thereby
     removing the legal uncertainty now attending the FDA rule. (The Fourth Circuit panel almost
     certainly will rule against the FDA, and the Supreme Court may well uphold this decision.)
     Second, the provision established a "risk reduction" standard to guide the regulation of tobacco
     products in piace oftne "safety and efficacy" standard applicable to other drugs and devices.
     Because the fonner makes sense when applied to inherently dangerous products whereas the
     latter does not, the change in standard would facilitate the FDA's regulation of tobacco products.

              This provision of the settlement, however, also contained several glaring weaknesses.
     First, as you noted in your first comments on the settlement, the FDA would have to prove a
     negative in order to reduce or eliminate nicotine -- i.e., that the action would not create a
     significant demand for contraband products. Second, the FDA could not eliminate nicotine for a
     period of 12 years. Third, the FDA could not take any action to modify tobacco products without
     sunnounting a number of procedural hurdles -- ~, fonnal rulemakings -- not usually applicable
     to administrative action.

              The public health community will demand -- and we believe the industry will grudgingly
     accept -- a legislative proposal that corrects these weaknesses. This proposal would eliminate the
     12-year waiting period and the special procedural hurdles in the current settlement. It also, and
     perhaps most important, would remove the necessity of the FDA's making a contraband finding.
      At one point, the industry proposed flipping the burden of proof on the contraband issue, so that
     the FDA could not take action if a party affirmatively demonstrated that doing so would create a
     significant contraband market. But even this approach puts too much weight on the contraband
     issue, which should be only one factor in the FDA's regulatory decisionmaking. The better
     approach is to authorize the FDA to order changes to tobacco products based on a simple finding
     that this change would reduce the risk of the product to the public and is technologically feasible,
     after consideration of the full range of consequences of the change, including the possible
     creation of a contraband market.


     Documents

             For decades, the tobacco industry has failed to disclose essential facts in its possession
     about the dangers and addictiveness of tobacco products. In particular, the industry has used
     both the attorney-client and the work product privileges to cloak scientific research and findings
     -- and to shield evidence of criminal or fraudulent behavior. The Attorneys General attempted to
     address this issue through creation of a special court to resolve all privilege claims made by the



                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
The industry is willing to make certain minor changes in the proposed scheme, but will not
accept changes recommended by the Justice Department and FDA. Even these changes will not
satisfy the harshest critics of the settlement, such as Skip Humphrey.

        The settlement calls for a national document depository and a three-judge panel
(appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States) to provide expedited rulings on
whether documents should remain privileged. The Attorneys General fought hard for this
proivision for two essential reasons. First, anyone -- not just a litigant, but any member of the
public (including the New York Times or David Kessler) -- could ask the panel to review
allegedly privileged documents. In this sense, the settlement establishes a Freedom of
Information Act for tobacco documents. Second, the requester would not have to make the
normal showing required in litigation for in camera review of a document: a prima facie case
that the document is not privileged -" because, for example, it advanced a scheme of crime or
fraud.

        The Justice Department, however, believes that this scheme, adopted without change,
would pose serious dangers. DOJ points out that no one knows whether or how this panel will
work -- whether the judges (or special masters appointed by them) will be competent; whether
they will be so swamped with document requests as to create an enormous backlog; whether they
will favor one side over the other. DOJ also notes that this panel will have sole authority to rule
on claims of privilege. While under the current system many courts may adjudicate a claim of
privilege (with a finding of privilege in one court often not precluding the opposite finding in
another), the special three-judge panel's decisions would be binding in all courts in all litigation
in the United States. On top of these Justice Department concerns, the FDA would like access to
all documents -- even those rightfully privileged -- to determine whether they contain scientific
or other health-related information (for example, reflecting the industry'S extensive research on
nicotine addiction) relevant to the regulation of tobacco products.

        To meet these agency concerns, we could strengthen the document provisions in two key
ways. First, we could make the administrative disclosure process non-exclusive, so that a litigant
could challenge a privilege claim in litigation even if the special panel had not completed review
of the document in question or had ruled in favor of the company. (By contrast, a finding by the
special panel that a document is not privileged would bind the company in all other proceedings.)
 Second, we could provide the FDA with access to all health-related documents, notwithstanding
any claims of privilege.

         The industry claims that it will not accept either of these changes. The industry'S most
recent proposal is to add a provision to the settlement requiring each company to identify and
disclose all health-related information contained in privileged documents, without turning over
the documents themselves. Under this proposal, the special panel could find that a company had
failed to disIcose such information and levy substantial penalties. The industry has also
expressed a willingness to consider a different scheme for selecting the people to sit on the
special panel.




                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion
changes recommended by the agencies to be inadequate. These changes do not broadly abrogate
the industry's attorney-client or work-product privileges. The Justice Department has expressed
serious concerns about any such breach of the privilege, arguing that this approach would
undermine the privilege generally and would enable a tobacco company official charged with
criminal conduct to assert a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of
counsel. But some will demand the complete abrogation of the companies' attorney-client
privilege as a term of the settlement -- or, even more broadly, insist (as Sen. Leahy, Rep.
Waxman, and Attorney General Skip Humphrey already have done) that the tobacco companies
disclose all privileged documents before any consideration of a settlement takes place.



Environmental Tobacco Smoke

         The best available scientific evidence indicates that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)
causes disease and death in non-smokers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
classifies ETS as a Class A carcinogen and estimates that it is responsible for about 3,000 lung
cancer deaths each year in non-smoking adults. The EPA also has found that ETS threatens the
health of hundreds of thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Serious
ETS restrictions, which ban smoking.in public places or at work except in enclosed areas
exhausted directly to the outside, reduce exposure to ETS and the harm it causes. At the same
time, such restrictions lead many smokers to quit smoking entirely and many more to cut down.
Indeed, among the many smoking cessation tools -- including substantial price increases -- ETS
restrictions may well be the most effective.

         All agree that the settlement's provision on ETS is extremely valuable, and needs few
changes. The proposed legislation would broadly prohibit smoking in public places, without
preempting even stricter state or local laws. The only question is whether to accept without
change the settlement's exception for restaurants (but not fast food restaurants), bars, private
clubs, hotel guest rooms, casinos, bingo parlors, and tobacco merchants. H.R. 3434, which the
Administration supported, exempts restaurants (including fast food restaurants) and bars. The
proposed rule on ETS that OSHA issued in 1994 does not include any exemption for the
hospitality industry. (In a number of other ways, however, the settlement is more protective of
public health than the OSHA rule, which in any event would face serious legal challenges if
finally issued.) HHS would prefer to cut back on the exception in the settlement, noting that
many of the exempted work places pose the greatest threat to non-smokers. The Department of
Labor (OSHA) would keep the exemption essentially as is on the ground that trying to include
restaurants, casinos, etc. would make the whole provision politically unsellable.
