We can reconfigure the theme.  I'd argue for keeping second-hand smoke in
our list because it is the largest single bump in increasing support for
legislation -- above youth smoking, advertising, and more money for
research and anti-cessation programs. Of course, they are all popular.
But seems very popular and is the only one that appeals directly to
non-smokers w/o children.
