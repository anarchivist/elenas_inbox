MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     JACK GIBBONS
                          Assistant to the President for Science and Technology

                         ELENA KAGAN
                         Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:                  CLONING POLICY OPTIONS

       Two upcoming events create the need to develop a position on legislation banning the
cloning of human beings. First, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) is about
to complete the review you requested of the ethical and legal issues associated with cloning
human beings. On Saturday, June 7, at its final public meeting, NBAC is expected to vote in
favor of a legislative ban. Second, France has proposed that the Denver Summit communique
include a paragraph urging countries to pass domestic legislative bans and to work together
toward a global ban.

        We recommend: (1) that you support domestic legislation banning human cloning, and
that you announce specific legislation at the top of your June 10th press conference; and (2) that
the U.S. support the gist of France's proposed cloning paragraph while insisting on critical
modifications.

NBAC's Findings and Recommendations

         In its draft final report, NBAC unanimously concludes that "it is morally unacceptable for
anyone ... to attempt to create a child" using the technology that created Dolly the sheep:
somatic cell nuclear transfer -- that is, the transfer of the nucleus from an adult somatic (non egg
or sperm) cell into an enucleated egg. NBAC bases this conclusion on safety concerns, finding
that the technology is "likely to involve substantial risk to the potential child." The report also
states that "serious ethical concerns ... require a great deal more widespread and careful thought
and public deliberation before this technology should be used."

        NBAC also concludes, however, that other forms of "human cloning" -- such as the
cloning of DNA sequences, cell lines, and tissues (which do not involve the creation of entire
human beings) -- are scientifically important and not ethically problematic. Moreover, NBAC
finds that animal cloning is ethically acceptable and promises important benefits. The
Commission thus cautions that restrictions on cloning not impede these activities.




                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
                                                                                                         2

            The Commission notes that current restrictions effectively prohibit federally funded and
    regulated entities from attempting to clone a human being through somatic cell nuclear transfer.
    However, fertility clinics and other privately-funded clinical and research establishments face no
    prohibition on human cloning, and NBAC questions whether some of these organizations will
    adhere to a voluntary moratorium.

            Accordingly, NBAC's draft final report calls for carefully-worded national legislation
    prohibiting anyone from "attempting to create a child through somatic cell nuclear transfer
    techniques." The Commission specifies that the legislation should include a sunset provision
    and that, prior to the sunset date, an oversight body should review and report on the status of
    somatic cell nuclear transfer technology and the ethical and social issues associated with its use
    in humans. NBAC also recommends that the U.S. cooperate with other countries to enforce
    mutually-supported cloning restrictions.

    National Legislation

            We recommend that you embrace NBAC's proposal to establish a narrowly crafted time-
    limited legislative moratorium. Legislation is the only way to establish a comprehensive,
    enforceable prohibition on cloning entire human beings in all publicly and privately funded
    research and clinical activities. If carefully written, the ban will not preclude important research.

           Reaction to proposed legislation will be mixed. A national and international consensus is
    emerging that attempting to apply the technology used to clone Dolly to humans is morally
    wrong. The American Medical Association has conveyed this view to NBAC, and the World
    Medical Association has issued a similar statement. Given NBAC's recommendation, we expect
    many in the scientific and ethics communities to accept a legislative moratorium.

             But some who agree that cloning a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer is
    morally unacceptable will oppose a legislated moratorium. In particular, the biotechnology and
    pharmaceutical industries strongly oppose legislation. These two industries are deeply concerned
    that a legislative debate will produce broadly drawn language that impairs critical research.
    Some academic researchers may share this view. Fertility clinics also may oppose legislation,
    but to date have not signaled a position.

            Finally, some in the right-to-life community will argue from the other side that NBAC's
    proposed approach does not go far enough. This community will push for a comprehensive ban
    on the creation of embryos, through any means, for research purposes (i.e., not for the purposes
    of creating a child). The Administration has applied this restriction to federally-funded research,
    but opposed legislation on the subject. This is an issue NBAC declined to review, and we do not
    recommend revisiting it in this context.                                                .

            We recommend that you announce your support for legislation and propose specific
    legislative language on June 10, at your scheduled press conference, three days after NBAC's


                                                        Automated Records Management System.
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion

recommendation will become public. We anticipate that the release ofNBAC's report will
prompt Congressional hearings and legislative proposals. By acting quickly you can maintain
your leadership on the issue and carefully frame the legislative debate, making clear the value of
biotechnology research and the danger of overly broad regulation, while calling for the
prohibition of an unethical use of a specific technology.

Group of Eight Statement on Cloning

       France has proposed a paragraph for inclusion in the 0-8 communique embracing
national and international bans on "reproductive human cloning." Germany will support the
statement; Canada will support it with some modification.

        The U.S. biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries strongly oppose including any
paragraph on cloning in the communique. They fear that it will not be carefully drafted and may
inadvertently extend to the cloning of DNA, cells, and tissues as well as entire human beings.
Further, industry is concerned that a statement on cloning ultimately could provide cover for
protectionist efforts to restrict U.S. biotechnology products and activities.

         Nevertheless, we recommend that the Administration support the French proposal with
critical modifications. Specifically, we suggest that the U.S. insist on changes to: (1) affirm the
potential medical and agricultural benefits of cloning technology; (2) limit the prohibition to "the
use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology to create a child;" and (3) propose a time-limited
moratorium instead of a ban. USDA and HHS support this position.

France's Proposed Language for G-8 Communique

We have taken note with great concern of recent scientific experiments which could open the way
to reproductive human cloning. We agree that the prohibition of any form of reproductive
human cloning needs both strict domestic legislation and close international cooperation to
adapt current international law. We are encouraged by the reflections underway within national
ethics committees as well as in various regional and international fora. We are determined to
give a strong impetus to their work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a universal ban
on reproductive human cloning.

Our Proposed Substitute Language

We have taken note that further development of the technology that enabled the recent cloning of
a sheep offers the promise of enormous medical and agricultural benefits. We have also taken
note with great concern that this scientific advance could open the way to using this technology
(by which we mean somatic cell nuclear transfer technology) to create a child. We agree on the
need for appropriate domestic legislation and close international cooperation to prohibit the use
of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child while countries explore ethical and scientific
implications in greater depth. We are encouraged by the reflections already underway within
national ethics committees as well as in various regional and international fora. We are
determined to give a strong impetus to their work with a view to arriving as soon as possible at a
universal moratorium on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a child.
