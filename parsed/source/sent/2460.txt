                                             October 17, 1998

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                              Elena Kagan

     SUBJECT:                 DPC Weekly Report

             Education -- Budget Deal: While your victory on class size reduction and your
     other education initiatives was remarkable, a number of key pieces of your education
     agenda remains unfinished. In addition to school modernization, there are two key areas
     we will focus on in the near term.' First, the final provision on national standards allows
     some test development work to continue (while banning pilot testing or implementation),
     and calls on NAGB and NAS to conduct additional studies in anticipation of possible
     Congressional consideration ofthis issue when NAEP is reauthorized in the next Congress.
      Because the likelihood of ever getting full Congressional support is so slim, we will develop
     a number of additional options for how to best continue to press for national standards.
     Second, as we work with the Education Department on a proposal for the reauthorization
     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will ensure that the concepts in the
     Education Opportunity Zones are fully reflected in that proposal and remain a central part
     of our education agenda.

              Health Care -- Kennedy-Jeffords Legislation: Despite our efforts, the Work Incentives
     Improvement Act (Kennedy-Jeffords) did not make into the final Omnibus budget appropriations
     bilL This bipartisan legislation, that you endorsed at the commemoration of the Americans with
     Disabilities Act (ADA) last July, enables people with disabilities to go back to work by providing
     an option to buy into Medicaid and Medicare, as well as other pro-work initiatives. The
     disability community believes this is the most significant legislation since the ADA. Although
     this bill was on the list of top Administration priorities throughout the final budget negotiations
     and received broad-based bipartisan support, it was rejected by Republicans because they did not
     want to have significant health expansions and because they thought it was too late in the process
     to approve such a significant piece of legislation. However, the disability community as well as
     the AIDS community and others are extremely appreciative that the Administration fought so
     hard to pass this legislation.

            Health Care -- AIDS Issues in the Budget: The Omnibus bill included significant new
     funding for HIV/AIDS. In particular, it included $110 million for funding to address the critical
     AIDS problem in the minority community. This increase, plus an additional $20 million that
     HHS has agreed to allocate from existing funds, meets the Congressional Black Caucuses' full
     funding request for this problem. In addition to this important victory, the Ryan White Program

                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion




       which provides a range of treatment and services for people with HN / AIDS, also received a
       $250 million -- or nearly 30 percent increase. The AIDS community and the CBC are quite
       pleased with this remarkable outcome. However, there is disappointment regarding the inclusion
       in the final bill of a needle exchange provision that prevents the District of Columbia from
       using their own funds for needle exchange programs. We strongly opposed this provision
       because it strips federal funds from community-based agencies trying to stop the spread of
       HIV through needle exchange programs.

                Health Care -- Race and Health in the Budget: The Congress has taken a critical
       first step in investing in your multi-year proposal to eliminate racial health disparities in
       six health areas, including HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and immunizations. As you know
       some of these disparities are startling. For example, African Americans under the age of 65
       have twice the rate of heart disease as whites, and Native Americans suffer from diabetes at
       nearly three times the average rate. The budget gives sufficient funding to finance the $80
       million you included in your budget request, including new grants for communities to
       develop new strategies to address these disparities.

              Health Care -- Historic Increases in Biomedical Research. The Congress agreed to
       fund your proposal to increase biomedical research at the NIH with a $2 billion expansion
       of NIH research funding --a 14-percent increase. This increase will enable scientists to
       pursue a wide range of important new breakthroughs in critical diseases, from Alzheimers
       to AIDS to genetic discoveries. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control also received
       your requested increases for new research to improve prevention efforts, including fighting
       emerging infectious diseases and combating new resistance to anti-biotics, and the Agency for
       Health Care Policy Research (AHCPR) received your requested increases to improve quality
       outcomes. For example, overuse of antibiotics has been shown to lead to resistance and cost as
       much as $7.5 billion a year. AHCPR's development and dissemination of guidelines for the
       appropriate use of antibiotics will result in better patient care and significant health care savings.

       Health Care --Pennsylvania DSH Payments. The entire Pennsylvania Congressional delegation is
       aggressively lobbying the Administration to waive administratively potentially hundreds of
       millions of dollars that HCFA's fiscal intermediaries have concluded that the state's hospitals owe
       as a result of inappropriate Medicare DSH payments. The Congressional delegation, the state,
       and the hospita,is have taken the position that they were unaware that billing for these DSH
       payments was problematic. Some even argue that their interpretation of the law is that the
       payments are legal. The delegation decided not to pursue a legislative fix in this area because
       CBO scores such an intervention as costing the Treasury and the Medicare Trust Fund over $300
       million. They are, instead, advocating for HCFA to step in administratively and place a
       moratorium on their FI's collections of past (and future) liabilities for a long enough period to
       fight HCFA in court or for Congress to intervene legislatively next year. Particularly because of
       the strong Democratic interest in this area and because it appears that HCFA has been
       inconsistently been applying the reimbursement rules, we are urging HCFA to be responsive as

                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
moratorium late next week. We will make sure the roll-out is done to reflect the interest of the
Members.

        Tobacco -- Medicaid Recoupment: During negotiations over the omnibus
appropriations bill, the Republican Leadership proposed including language which would have
waived our right to the federal share of state tobacco recoveries. They would not, however, agree
to conditions requiring states to spend a portion of the funds on a menu of items and the language
was therefore not included in the bill. We plan to tell the states and others that we are willing to
consider this issue next year, but only if the federal share of settlement funds to a list of
specified activities along the lines of the menu negotiated in the McCain bill and preferably
including tobacco control activities.

         Crime -- Prison Drug Testing/Treatment: In the budget agreement we succeeded in
including legislative language to allow states to use up to 10% of federal prison funds to
implement drug testing and treatment plans for prisoners and parolees. As you know, you called
for this change in law in a directive on coerced abstinence that you signed last year.

        Crime -- Brady Implementation: The final budget agreement ensures that the Brady
National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will go on-line as planned at the
end of next month. While the final compromise does not allow the FBI to charge a user fee, it
appropriates 42 million dollars to pay for these checks and, more importantly it doe snot require
the immediate destruction of records. This latter provision would have delayed implementation
of the NICS by 6-8 months.

         Community Empowerment -- Final Budget Agreement: The final budget agreement
included almost all ofthemajor initiatives proposed in your State of the Union and FY99
Budget. Some of the highlights include: 1) 50,000 new Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers; 2)
the first year funding for the Round II Empowerment Zones; 3) a 19 percent increase in the
Community Development Financial Institution Fund budget; 4) enactment of the landmark public
housing reform legislation; 5) extension of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) and the
Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit (WTWTC); 6) an 18 percent increase in homeless assistance; 7) a
33 percent expansion ofHUD's Fair Housing programs that are part of your One America
Initiative; 8) full funding for EPA's Brownfield's program; 9) and the creation of a new program
to provide Individual Development Accounts (IDA) to empower individuals to save for a first
home, post secondary education, or to start a new business. The enactment of the IDA legislation
means that you have fulfilled, at some level, all of the promises made in Putting People First in
the area of community empowerment.

        The one initiative which Congress was unwilling to consider as part of the tax extenders
legislation was your proposal to expand the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC).
However, we believe that the ground work has been laid to secure Congressional approval next
year for the LIHTC and a longer extension of the WOTC and the WTWTC. Over the next

proposals for your FY2000 budget and State of the Union that will build on the victories we
achieved in this year's budget.

        Welfare Reform -- Teen Birth and Pregnancy Rates: Two recent reports show
continued good news regarding teen birth and pregnancy rates. CDC announced preliminary data
showing a 3 percent drop in the teen birth rate from 1996 to 1997, the sixth annual decline in a
row and a drop of 15 percent since 1991. The latest rate, for 1997, is 52.9 births per 1,000 girls
between 15 and 19 years old. Teen birth rates declined for all racial groups, though the rate of
decline for blacks was slightly less than for other groups. A new report from the Alan
Guttmacher Institute shows the teen pregnancy rate dropped nearly 13 percent from 1991 to 1995
and now stands at the lowest level since 1975, at 101 pregnancies per 1,000 15- to 19-year-old
girls. Researchers attribute the drop in pregnancy rates to a decline in sexual activity among
teens and improved use of contraceptives. The teen pregnancy data lag several years behind the
teen birth data because the pregnancy data depend on abortion data which take longer to collect.
In several months, CDC will produce its own estimate of the teen pregnancy rate which will
show a similar trend but will be estimated using a slightly different methodology. CDC's report
will also contain teen pregnancy rates by race and ethnicity.
