RE PRESS CONFERENCE .... As you can see by the schedule, it's been moved to
Friday.

Staff Secretary is just holding onto the book we gave them last week.
Phil Caplan said he wants to give POTUS the briefing book Wednesday
so ... if you have any updates/additions, please email them to me by midday
wednesday.

Thanks.
