MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES
               SYLVIA MATHEWS
               JOHN PODESTA

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  Long-Term Strategic Planning

        In thinking about priorities for the remainder of the President's term, we think it is useful
to ask five kinds of questions:

1.      What are the most serious problems facing the nation today -- the issues of most genuine
        importance to the country's future?

2.      What does the President most deeply care about? What issues speak to him and arouse
        his passion? What are his most intense and personal commitments?

3.     In what areas can the President actually accomplish something? Where can he show real
       and measurable achievements? Where can he most make a difference?

4.     What will he get credit for, now and in the future? What succes~es will people notice and
       care about? What successes will they attribute to the President?

5.     What commitments has the President already made and what priorities has he already set?

        These questions often point in different directions. An extremely serious issue may not
be one the President can do anything about; an issue on which he can make real progress may not
be one that moves him; an issue he cares about deeply may not be one on which others give him
deserved credit; etc. In setting priorities for the remainder of his term, the President should try to
determine the few issues where everything comes together: urgency, passion, the potential for
accomplishment, the likelihood of recognition, and consistency with prior commitments.

        Among domestic priorities (any President must and should make "American Leadership
Abroad" a top priority), we think these questions point to a focus on (1) education, particularly
standards and school reform initiatives; (2) health care, including entitlement reform, coverage
expansion, consumer protection, and biomedical research; (3) children and family, particularly
child care programs; and (4) welfare reform. We should continue to push our agenda on crimes
and drugs -- especially with respect to community policing -- but should recognize that we




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

probably will be playing defense in this area for the next two years. We should take the
President's commitment to racial reconciliation seriously -- but largely by focusing not on race
itself, but on the problems of education, health care, crime, etc. felt by people in poor rural areas
and inner cities.

        1. Education: The President already has said that education -- particularly national
standards -- is his first priority, and he has credibility in this area. The state of the nation's public
schools demands action, and the President speaks with knowledge and feeling about these issues.
 The only question is whether he can make significant progress on this front, given the traditional
preeminence of state and local governments over K-12 schooling. We think he can, so long as he
chooses his targets with some care. He must continue to fight for voluntary national testing,
recognizing that progress in this area will be measured in the long term. And he should combine
this campaign with its natural complement -- a program of school reform, designed to foster a
new "ethic" of education involving high expectations, accountability, and public school choice.
We recommend, in particular, a program to select a number of inner cities (the places of greatest
educational need) as "Educational Opportunity Zones," in which schools would receive special
assistance in exchange for adopting policies of no social promotion, public school choice,
reconstitution offailing schools, removal of bad teachers, etc. In addition to standards and
school reform efforts, the President should continue to emphasize education technology and
should propose increased mentoring and support services for poor middle- and high-school
students to encourage minority enrollment in higher education.

        2. Health Care: We are very well-positioned to make continued progress in health care,
building on the gains we made in the budget. A sustained focus in this area -~ where federal
action is the norm and where bipartisan action is often feasible -- will leave a record of strong
accomplishment. Entitlement reform is the surest route to credibility and perhaps the greatest
need, but it is also the area where tangible accomplishment will be most difficult. We should
work hard there, but should not ignore the rest of our health care agenda: further coverage
expansions (for the 55-65 age cohort or workers in-between jobs), consumer protection reforms
(to ensure quality, prevent discrimination, and protect privacy), and increased biomedical
research (taking advantage of Republican support and perhaps using money from a tobacco
settlement). By the close of the President's term, he can have amassed a substantial record in this
area, which will make people view in an entirely different light our lack of success in passing the
Health Security Act.

        3. Children and Families: For a number of reasons -- including the passage of welfare
reform, recent discoveries about early childhood development, and increased understanding of
the difficulties of balancing work and family -- the issue of child care is ready to burst onto the
national scene, and the President and First Lady should be in the vanguard. There is a great need
for leadership (although, as in education, some resistance to federal leadership ) to ensure that
child care of decent quality is available and affordable for working Americans. Given their
commitment and credibility in this area, the President and First Lady have an opportunity to push
through significant reforms, perhaps including changes in the dependent care tax credit, increased




                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

child care subsidies, and quality enhancements. An especially important feature of this package
of reforms (even a promise of universal access, if we can manage it) should be after-school (but
generally in-school) programs that give school-age children enriching and activity-filled
afternoons.

         4. Welfare Reform: Whatever else the President does during his term in office, he will be
judged in significant measure by the success or failure of welfare reform. Welfare reform has the
potential to be the greatest social policy achievement of our generation -- or to be a terribly
harmful social experiment. For this reason, welfare reform must remain near the top of the
President's agenda, even though actual control ofthe welfare system is now largely in the hands
of state and local governments. The President should be actively engaged in promoting private
sector hiring of welfare recipients and implementing our new $3 billion welfare-to-work
program. He should push Congress to invest more in welfare reform efforts (for example, by
passing our initiative in NEXTEA for welfare-related transportation services); he should push
states to make good use ofTANF monies. In short, for the remainder of his term, he should
maintain continuous and relentless involvement in this area.
