TEXT:
James tells me he asked an OLC lawyer to work with you on your executive order.
If that's more than enough legal advice for you, that's fine with me. On the
other hand, if you want some more, that would be great with me too.  (Just let
me know what you're doing, when you're meeting, and what I should be reading.)
I guess, more generally, I'd love for you to keep me in mind and get me involved
in some interesting things. Whether it's this or something else (or this and
something else), I'll leave to you. Talk to you soon.
