TEXT:
that if there's anything i can do for you on the crime initiatives, you should
let me know.
by the way, the 'head of doj 's criminal division tells me that i was right (and
the doj folks were wrong) when i said at last week's meeting that gun offenses
do not count as a predicate act under rico.    i don't know if amending rico to
include gun offenses would be smart or stupid·as a matter of politics -- or as a
matter of policy -- but it definitely is an option.
