TEXT:
I talked with John Koskinnen re the Klinger request.  It seems that our policy
is to bring furloughed people back when their absence will "substantially
impair" an appropriated agency's ability to function.  John and I agreed that
there's no "substantial impairment" of Congress's ability to function in this
case, since there's no real reason why Congress needs this information now.   It
seems as if a Klinger staffer already has given EPA an extension until two weeks
after the end of the furlough.  John passed this information on to the other
agencies and told that them that it was up to them to decide how to respond.
That seems fine to me.
