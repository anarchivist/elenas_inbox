Re the Guss fax: what legal opnion from HHS?
Re Ruby Ridge: John is unreachable until this afternoon.  When he calls me back,
I'll set up a conference call for later in the afternoon or tomorrow morning.
As for staffing, that is of course your call, and nothing I said was meant to
suggest otherwise.  Just let me know.
