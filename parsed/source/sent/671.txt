Subject:         Liquor advertising letter to Reed Hundt

Kathy asked that I connect with you regarding finalizing the President's
liquor advertising letter to Hundt.  Klain has requested that we try to
get this done this week, prior to the VP's departure for China.  please
give me a call when you can so that we can discuss what we need to do to
get this done.

It appears that we need to (1) ensure that the letter is appropriately
cleared; (2) send it through channels for signature; (3) have OPL, OLA,
and others make notification calls; and (4) discuss with VP's press
office. Do you have additional thoughts on this?

Thanks.

Jon Kaplan
