TEXT:
Just stopped by, but you weren't around.  The memo is great (both
versions). ,I'll play with it a bit when I know which version to play
with, but I don't expect to do too much.

We need to tell Justice to get us over a revised version of their letter,
with the 25/250 recommendation. The new version should specifically
address why that is the correct recommendation, referring (as the current
version does on several occasions, but without reference to a particular
recommendation) to the ounce threshhold for mid-level dealers.   I also
would take out' the sentence starting "Moreover," in the 4th full paragraph
on p.3.  It's not convinvcing, and it distracts from the central criminal
justice rationale,   (On the other hand, I think the third bullitt on that
page is fine.)

And you said I wouldn't be able to work in the sun.

Thanks.
