TEXT:
I think the latest idea is to have the President discuss NBAC's
recommendations at the top of a press conference on June 11 or 12.   Is
there any way to do this without telling everybody everything first?
Perhaps holding the meeting on the morning of the same day? Let me know
what the options are.                      '
