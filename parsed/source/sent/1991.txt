TEXT:
OK -- i'm just going to say it again -- it is absurd that he is doing this
and that people think he is doing it on our behalf.  He is not the one who
should be talking with HHS, leg, congress, etc. re these issues.  Cynthia
is. And someone has to tell him that.

A couple of items:

1. Claxton was unhappy with today's call. Neither Treasury or OMB ran
any of the numbers by him before we presented them to Harkin/Chafee.
Claxton, Gruber, Gotbaum are scheduled to meet today at 4pm.  I think this
will sort itself out.

2. HHS has turned down McCain's request that Donna testify 3/3. HHS
cited two reasons:   (1) she has a conflict (an approps hearing); and (2)
she has already testified before Labor, the committee of jurisdiction, and
HHS doesn't want to weigh into a jurisdictional battle. HHS suggested an
FDA/CDC/AHCPR/NIH panel instead.    McCain's staff 'thought you may have
committed to sending Donna.    If you would like to push back on HHS's
decision, let me know and I will check with Leg and review the precedents.
