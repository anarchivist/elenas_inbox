Katie took me aside at the 8:15 on a matter concerning Diane Regas.         We should
talk briefly about this when you have time.

The SSI issue didn't come up at 7:30.  Mary Ellen Glynn asked me about it at
8:15. She agrees that we shouldn't do it next week, and would prefer that we
not do it this week either.  She said she would talk to Mike about it.

Otherwise:
1. Don Baer said the policy shops have to give him paper soon on the SOTU --
both overall "vision" and specific suggestions.

2. OMB is continuing public release of the DC plan.        There's a package of
materials I'll try to get for both of this morning.

3. The campaign finance meeting Hilley wanted (with the reform groups and
President) won't happen this week.  There's going to be a formal,
Presidential-level announcement of the DNC leaders this week.  Rahm wants to
release info on DNC reforms at the same time.  Some people doubted whether the
reform plan would be ready in time.  Leon pressed for an expedition.

4. Gene's education event is set to roll for Thursday.         (Why exactly is this
GENE's education event?)

5. Rahm asked that we (I say "we," but it was'unclear to whom he was talking)
figure out whether or how to plug into state efforts to pass HMO Patients'
Bills of Rights.  (See the Washington Post this morning.)

6. All agreed that Mike should comment      as little as possible on the Pear story
and the details of the Administration's     Medicaid proposals.  To the extent he
needs to say something, he should state     the two overarching principles: (1)
retaining the individual guarantee and     (2) placing constraints on overall
spending.
