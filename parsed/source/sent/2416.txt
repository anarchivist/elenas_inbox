Subject:         Re: Fatherhood

Yes, we've been working closely with the Vice President's folks for months
on fatherhood issues. Andrea has organized a working group that includes
Nancy Hoit (who advises the VP from Boston) and other VP staff who are
here in D.C. including Lisa Mallory.

Subject:         Fatherhood

Keep in mind as you work on this that this is a big VP issue. He directs
the Federal Fatherhood Initiative, at the President's request, which
submits an annual report to the President on how federal policies/agencies
are doing in our efforts to implement the President's EO on Fatherhood.

 This was also the subject of the 1993 Gore Family Conference, the first
 one that POTUS attended.   The VP also regularly attends/speaks at
 national fatherhood conventions and meetings (indeed, it was at the 1998
 National Fatherhood Conference where the VP made his infamous Michael
 Jackson/Michael Jordan slip-up, after he followed fatherhood-spokesman
 Mike Singeltarry to the podium.)  Nancy Hoit of our operation handles this
 issue for us.
