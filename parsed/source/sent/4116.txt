TEXT:
The FOP is once again reminding us that we have not resolved the secret
service unionization issue.  There's now a new Director of the Secret
Service, so we don't have any good reason to postpone this any longer. We
did an informational memo for the President on this issue a couple of
months ago; we can easily turn that into a decision memo, for either him
or Erskine.  Let's discuss how to proceed.
