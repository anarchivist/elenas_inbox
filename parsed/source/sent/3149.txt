          No version of the Garemendi proposal is free from legal
difficulties.    But there is a perfectly credible, if not
necessarily winning, argument that the Administration has
authority either to use Option 9 timber as replacement timber
under 2001 (k) (3) (Version 1) or to offer Option 9 timber in
exchange .for other timber recently or soon to be released under
2001(k) (1) (Version 2).   By contrast, the legal support for
simply reducing the volume of Option 9 timber by ·the amount of
timber released under 2001(k) (Version 3) is much more scanty.
          The legality of the various Garemendi schemes rests largely
on two sections of the Rescissions Act -- 2001(d) and 2001(k) --
and the relationship between them.    Section 2001(d) -- the Option
9 sction -- provides that the Administration "shall expeditiously
prepare, offer, and award timber sale contracts" covered by the
Forest Plan, often referred to as Option 9.    Section 2001 (k) (1)
-- the Section 318 section -- provides that the Administration
shall release all contracts previously offered or awarded in the
area subject to Section 318 of a prior appropriations bill.      (The
scope of this provision -- specifically, whether it orders the
release only of the particular sales referenced in Section 318 or
of all sales ever awarded in the area covered by that section
is currently before the Ninth Circuit.)    Section 2001(k) (3)
provides that if any of the sales under 2001(k) (1) cannot be
awarded -- most notably, because of the existence of an
endangered bird species known as the marbled murrolet -- the
Administration shall provide the purchaser "an equal volume of
timber, of like kind and value."
          The question whether the Administration (pursuant to Version
1) can use Option 9 timber as replacement timber under
2001 (k) (3), should the Administration win the marbled murrolet
case and thus come under an obligation to provide replacement
timber, is genuinely difficult. No language in 2001(d) or
2001(k) specifically prevents the Administration from using

Option 9 timber as the source of replacement timber.   Nor is
there any legislative history specifically addressing this issue.
The Administration, it might be argued, thus has the discretion
to implement the statute in this way.   (Of course, the Option 9
timber substituted -- like any other timber substituted -- will
have to be of equal volume and like kind and value, as required
by 2001 (k) (3).) Timber industry lawyers will argue, however,
that such a scheme subverts the broadest goals of the statute.
Congress, it will be argued, intended for two sets of sales


-option 9 sales and 318 sales -- to go forward as expeditiously
and completely as possible: to use one as substitution for the
other is a form of double

-counting that undermines this purpose.
        Reasonable people can disagree as to the strength of these

arguments.   DOJ lawyers handling this issue believe that industry
lawyers will have' the better of this argument.    (See DOJ memo
attached.)   Lawyers from the White House Counsel's Office and CEQ
think this analysis slightly overstates the strength of the
industry's position.    What is clear, as DOJ lawyers agree, is
that there is at least a credible claim that the Administration
has authority to adopt version 1 of the Garamendi proposal.
         The legal analysis relating to version 2 of the Garamendi
proposal proceeds in a similar manner, but with one prefatory
caution.   It is important to note that the Administration has no
authority to force purchasers of timber released or soon to be
released under 2001(k) to take Option 9 timber in its place.     The
purchasers of these. sales have a property right to them; the most
the Administration can'do is to offer the purchasers the
opportunity to take Option 9 timber instead.    The ability of the
Administration to make this offer turns on the same arguments
discussed above.   Again, nothing in the statute or legislative
history specifically prevents this approach; but the approach
does undermine the apparent intention of Congress to get out two
separate sets of timber sales.
         The proposal to reduce Option 9 output by the amount of
timber released under 2001(k) (Version 3 of the Garamendi plan)
presents a different set of questions; the legality of such an
approach is far more dubious.    First, this proposal might be
thought to violate the specific directive of 2001(d) to award
Option 9 contracts expeditiously.    Second, the proposal appears
to violate 2001(1), which prevents any revisions to land
management plans, including the President's Forest Plan (Option
9), "because of implementation or impacts" of sales required by
2001.  And even if this action were legal, adopting it might
invite further challenge to the President's Forest Plan, because
the action seems to concede that significant new circumstances,
vitally affecting the Plan, have arisen.
