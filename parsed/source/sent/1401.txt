Subject: Sudden Cardiac Arrest -- Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs)
Update

Here is where the matter stands:  I have been working with Tom Freedman to
explore a possible POTUS or VPOTUS event. There appears to be an
opportunity for positive federal intervention because as many as 50,000 of
the more than 300,000 people who die a year from sudden cardiac arrest
could be saved if a normal heart rhythm could be restored within 5 min.
Today an individual's chances of surviving vary from greater than 30% to
less than 5%, depending on where they live.  There is agreement that the
federal gov't can help by adding its support to a 3 year study of the
effectiveness of making AEDs available to minimally trained individuals
such as security guards.  There is near violent disagreement between HHS
and outside experts about whether the federal gov't can do anything before
the study is completed to help lessen this problem.

I have 5 of the nation's leading experts flying into town on Thursday for
a 2pm briefing on the problem and the opportunities.  HHS is refusing to
send anyone to the meeting.  I spoke with Bill Corr today and he feels
strongly that I have already dragged too many HHS staff (about 6) to too
many meetings (about 3) and that I am wasting their time.

Any thought?
