Here's a written recap, per your request, of where we are on outreach.
Congressional Outreach

As. you know, Hilley and Rich Tarplin talked Thursday and tentatively
agreed to the outreach process outlined below, and Hilley has asked that
we work with Dan and Tracey.   Jerry, Rich and I are briefing Dan and
Tracey in a noon conference call Monday.

Monday, July 7:          Rich calls leadership staff to let them know (1)
the Adm·inistration will contact key committees and offer Shalala/Reed
 (bipartisan) briefing, and (2) the Administration would be happy to brief
any group(s) convened by leadership.    Once contact has been made, WH/HHS
staff contact four key committee chairs to arrange briefings (Senate:
Labor, Judiciary; House: Labor, Commerce).
Week of July 7: Begin Shalala/Reed committee briefings.
                         Staff reach out to secondary committees and
leading pro/anti tobacco members not on committees to inform them of the
review process.
Week of.July 14:         Continue Shalala/Reed meetings.


Public Outreach

First meeting is Wednesday, with KOOp and Kessler, time TBD.  HHS has sent
over a modified outreach plan, which I'm leaving on your chair.   We are
meeting with them at 1:00 Monday to finalize our outreach effort.   HHS is
pushing for a more comprehensive process involving "senior officials"
other than Donna and Bruce. Jerry and I prefer to stick with the approach
outlined in Erskine memo-- Donna and Bruce do a small number of visible
public health-focused meetings. We simply can't do a comprehensive effort
in 2 weeks. At Monday's meetings with HHS, I hope we can reaffirm that
strategy and spend some time talking about whether/ how to do a public
meeting/hearing.
