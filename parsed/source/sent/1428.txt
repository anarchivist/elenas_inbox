      It seems as if you're on track.  I would get Mac Reed involved now (with
      an explanation that we've made no final decisions yet); he's more helpful
      when he feels as if he's been br9ught into the process from the start.    On
     'substance: it sounds as if it won't get us much press in the short run,
      but may be valuable in the long run -- and that's fine.   You should make
      sure with Lancaster et al. that the community will say nice things about
      it, rather than rip into us for not doing enough or not doing something
      now, etc.  I guess the one question I'd ask is whether we could join the
      order with some other action, so that we're no just examining/studying,
      but actually doing/changing something. The action could involve federal
      employment alone (like the EO) or could relate to employment issues more
      generally. On the former, wasn't there some proposal that OMB didn't
      like, but that Erskine thought was eminently reasonable involving DOD? On
      the latter, do we know where we are on CASA yet?  Is there anything else
      that makes sense and that we could put together by the end of July? Let
      me know.

     Subject: Executive order for employment of disabled

      We just got a new and substantially revised version of this draft
      executive order, after advice from DOL.  I just talked it through with
      John Lancaster of the President's Committee on Employment of People with
      Disabilities, who is shepherding it.  It is now going through one more
      round of comments from the appointees with disabilities and DOL before the
     'attention turns to us.  DOL/Seth Harris is supposedly pretty positive on
      it. I have talked a bit to Anne Lewis of NEC on this and will talk to her
      more to get their perspective.

     The current draft is much more benign that the previous one we saw. There
     is no "quota" or goal of employment.  Instead, it has a long preamble on
     why this issue is important, a statement that the employment rate of the
     disabled should be "as close as possible" to the one for the non-disabled,
     and it establishes a federal agency task force, led by DOL, to examine all
     agency programs and policies to figure out h~w to encourage employment of

     the disabled,  A few agencies are called on to do specific things, most of
                                                                                            Page 2 of2

     which are OK,  The task force has to report in a year and then biannually
     after that until 2002.

     The main problem is I'm not sure what it adds up to.  On the other hand,
     if it focuses attention on this issue, pleases the community right before
     the ADA anniversary, and comes up with a few good ideas, maybe that's OK
     -- I'm not sure what our standard for executive orders are.

     I can send it to you if you want to see it, but otherwise I am going to
     see what additional comments John Lancaster gets and talk to NEe.  I
     assume we don't go to Mac Reed/OMB counsel's office to vet this until we
     are sure that we like the general idea. The ADA anniversary is July 26,
     so we have to get it moving if we are going to do it. Any advice is
     welcome.
