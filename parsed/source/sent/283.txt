TEXT:
1. where are we on setting up a process for the welfare-to-work
flexibility act that you were interested in? Should we meet (with or
without some staff) to figure out next steps?

2. And if you're still interested, we're still· interested in setting up a
strategy group on family issues to meet every other week.  Let me know
what you think would make sense.
