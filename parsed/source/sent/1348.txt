Subject:         Re: Airbags?

We shouldn't do airbags.   Here's the situation. In about a month, DOT
will issue a rule allowing people to deactivate their airbags.   The
rationale for the rule is that airbages can endanger kids and small adults
in the front seat of automobiles.   But we don't want to convey the message
that these deactivators are a great thing.   Instead, we want to convey the
message clearly that people should install and use these only in rare
circumstances; for many people; they are positively dangerous. Because
this is a complicated message -- and because the government action here is
not a clean fix (this is a real risk-risk tradeoff) -- and finally,
because the government t·rack record on airbag regulation is not very good
-- we shouldn't try to hype this into a big message event.   I would argue
for a written statement on the day the rule is issued.
