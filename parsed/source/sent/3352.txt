TEXT:
1.  Sorry for not knowing that the citizen child provision was out.  I hope that
wasn't embarrassing at the meeting this morning.
2.  Lest you ever doubted my constitutional analysis on that provision, I'll
have you know that according to Chris, (1) the great majority of DOJ folks who
weighed in on the question agreed with me and (2) OLC, though not changing its
ultimate position, radically revised its theory.
3.  Sometime when you have time, I'd love to hear about this morning's meeting.
