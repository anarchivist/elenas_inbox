Subject: Potential HHS fallback position on displacement

Monahan tells me that HHS may surface a fallback option on displacement:

They may propose that anti-displacement rules should be limited to those
whose employment is subsidized by TANF or the $3 billion.  But they would
not apply if the person were getting TANF help for child care or
transportation.  In the latter case, other employees then could not bring
a grievance against their hiring.

Sounds pretty reasonable to me.   I wonder if it discourages wage
subsidies, and encourages states to spend money on support services rather
than direct employer subsidies ....
