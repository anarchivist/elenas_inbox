1. where are we on this?
2.  I've approved one change that the NTSB asked for (I'm assuming they're OK
with the rest): Instead of the phrase "assisting families     . similar needs,"
please insert:  "ensuring that families who wish to travel to the accident site
receive all necessary assistance,"
Thanks.
