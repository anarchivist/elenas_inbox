                    ON FAITH AND FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS
                               Monday, May 24, 1999

I. SET-UP: FAITH AND AMERICA'S COMMON VALUES

       Today, I want to talk about one of America's greatest strengths: the faith and religious
values of our people.

        This is a subject that has weighed on my mind since the awful events at Columbine High
School, and the senseless shooting at Heritage High School just four days ago. We must make it
easier for all Americans to live and express their own faith - to strengthen the values we share.

        That is in the best tradition of our nation. George Washington once said that Americans
have "abundant reason to rejoice that in this land, every person may worship God according to
the dictates of his own heart." Religious freedom is America's first freedom. We have been
proud to press for it around the world.

        From the beginning of our history, refugees from religious persecution have come here
for safety. My mother's family, the Lafons, were French Huguenots, driven from their homeland
because of their religious faith, Protestantism. They found a new home here in America. My
family has never taken our freedom to worship for granted.

        As America's faith traditions have flourished, they have both shaped and strengthened
our common values: honesty and discipline. Character and community. Belief in the family.
Belief in responsibility - and in responding to the needs of others.

        Today, faith is showing a new and vital power at the grassroots. Community by
community, a growing movement of faith- and values-based organizations are helping to meet
some of our most intractable social problems - challenges that had confounded us for decades:
turning around the drug-addicted; moving people from welfare to work; breaking up dangerous
teen gangs. In many of these efforts, faith is the leaven that rises the bread - the unique and
transformative ingredient that enables people to turn their lives around.

       That is why I have chosen to address this subject today. At a time when our spiritual
needs have never been greater - at a time when too many children and families want moral
sustenance and strength - faith can playa powerful role for those who choose it.

       I believe America must do more to strengthen and sustain our faith-based values - in
ways that also strengthen the core freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.

II. THE NEW POWER OF FAITH-BASED APPROACHES TO SOCIAL PROBLEMS

        We should start by recognizing that today, faith is at the heart of a new movement for
social action in America.


                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
conferences Tipper and I hold each summer - where we learned how a higher example can help
reconnect children with fathers who had abandoned them. In many cases, nothing else had
worked -- until faith was added to the equation.

        I have also seen the transformative power of faith-based approaches through the national
Coalition I have led to help people move successfully from welfare to work - the Coalition to
Sustain Success.

        In San Antonio, I met a woman named Herlinda Flores. Lilly had given up on finding
work, and had gone on welfare. She had so many challenges to face. English was her second
language. She didn't think she had the skills to hold ajob. And she had begun to conclude that
maybe she didn't deserve one. Then she signed up for job training at the Christian Women's Job
Corps.

         Through the Job Corps, she met a woman who mentored through prayer and bible study,
and she soon began to regain her self-confidence. Faith gave her a new feeling of self-worth, of
purpose - something no other program could give her. When I met her, she told me that for the
first time in years, she had applied for a position at Wal-Mart. Then she looked me in the eye,
and said with pride, "I know I'll get the job." She did. She was recently honored as employee of
the month.

        In San Francisco, I met a woman named Vicki VanFossen. Because of a severe drug
addiction, she had lost custody of her two children, lost her job, and gone on welfare. The only
way back was to beat her addiction, and nothing seemed to work. Then she joined a faith-based
program that was part of our Coalition to Sustain Success, and finally gained the inner strength to
become clean. She regained custody of her children. And she has kept a full-time job. When I
asked what she could do for others in the same bind, she said, "unfortunately, nothing -- unless
they want to change first." For Vicki, it was faith that enabled her to pry open the vise grip of
drug addiction.

       That is why, as part of the National Drug Control Strategy I announced earlier this year,
we are now doing special outreach to the faith community, to enlist them in our war against
drugs.

        My wife Tipper sees the power of faith through her work with the homeless at Christ
House, in Washington, D.C. Many at Christ House are struggling with substance abuse and
mental health issues -- but there is often a spiritual void as well. So Christ House does more than
provide shelter and medical care. It creates a loving, trusting atmosphere that helps address the
issues that led to homelessness in the first place. Its founder tells the story of a reporter who spent
a week there, interviewing the patients. At the end of her time, she said: "What amazed me is
that for all of the medical treatment, I didn't hear anyone talking about putting on bandages, or


                                                  2


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

        Then there is Reverend Eugene Rivers, who has been hailed for helping to take back the
worst neighborhoods of Boston through faith. He remembers a hardened gangster telling him:
"I'm there when Johnny goes out for a loaf of bread for mama. I'm there, you're not. I win, you
lose. It's all about being there." But Reverend Rivers resolved that he would be there, too. He
was, and he faced down the gangs. He did for the children of Boston what no other program had
done -- what it sometimes takes God's help for all of us to manage: he loved them, no matter
how beaten down, how hopeless, how despairing.

        Partly because of his work, Boston went 18 months without losing a single child to gun
violence. Even Boston's most hard-boiled police and prison wardens have been surprised to see
the difference that faith makes.

      "You couldn't function effectively without ministers in Boston," says William Bratton,
Boston's former police commissioner.

         Boston's Mayor, Thomas Menino, says of faith leaders: "They have a mission. They get it
done."

       Ron Corbett of the State's Probation Department says, "We went through a phase where
we were pretty skittish about dealing with religious organizations." Based on their success in
turning around the toughest prisoners, he had to admit: ''we were wrong."

I believe the lesson for our nation is clear: in those specific instances where the unique power of
faith can help us meet crushing social challenges that are otherwise impossible to meet - such as
drug addiction and gang violence - we should explore carefully-tailored partnerships with our
faith community, so we can use the approaches that are working best to meet our urgent needs.

       In that way, we can allow faith and religious values to playa greater role in our hardest-
pressed communities, in ways that benefit us all.

III. ALLOWING FAITH IN OUR SCHOOLS, IN OUR WORKPLACE, AND IN OUR
NATION

        We need to do more to allow faith and values to flourish not just in our hard-pressed
communities, but also in our schools, in our workplaces, and in our society at large. And I
believe we can and must do so in ways that do not erode the separation of church and state.

       Let's consider our schools. In Jefferson County, Colorado, I met and embraced the
parents of Cassie Bernal, who died at Columbine. Her last words, as she started into the barrel of
a loaded gun, were: "yes, I do believe in God."



                                                 3


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

       When the shooting began, she was quietly reading her Bible in the Columbine library.
She knew she did not have to leave her faith at the schoolhouse door.

         Today, in too any communities, children and teachers are still not aware of their right to
voluntarily practice their religious beliefs -- including prayer in school -- and to pursue religious
activities on school grounds.

        Yet studies show that children who are involved in religious activities are much less
likely to use drugs. And common sense tells us that in a culture of chaotic values, children are
more likely to stay out oftrouble if they are spiritually grounded.

        That is why, in 1995 and again last year, our Department of Education issued clear
guidelines to clear up the confusion about the kinds of religious activity that are permissible in
public schools - and we gave those guidelines to every school district in America.

        Here is what they say: students have the right to pray privately and individually in school.
They have the right to say grace at lunchtime. They have the right to meet in religious groups on
school grounds and to use school facilities, just like any other club. They have the right to read
the Bible or any religious text during study hall or free class time. They also have the right to be
free from coercion to participate in any kind of religious activity in school.

       There are some who believe we need a Constitutional Amendment to allow prayer in our
schools. We already have one. It's called the First Amendment.

         Since we issued these guidelines, appropriate religious activity has flourished in our
schools, and there has been a substantial decline in the debate and litigation that has accompanied
this issue for too long.

        Two years ago, we applied the same approach to the federal workplace. We clarified that
federal employees may engage in personal religious expression to the greatest extent possible,
consistent with workplace efficiency and the requirements oflaw.

        We clarified that federal employers may not discriminate in employment on the basis of
religion. And we clarified that an agency must reasonably accommodate its employees' religious
practices.

IV. DRAWING A CLEAR LINE: THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE

        The question now is, how do we move forward? How do we strengthen the faith and
religious values that build character and community, while protecting the First Amendment
freedoms that are so essential to religious freedom itself?


                                                  4

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
careful balance that has served us well since our founding.

        Our founders knew history. They could look back on centuries of religious war in Europe
that tore nations apart. They resolved that religious war should never tear this nation apart - and
the only way to do that was to allow religious freedom. The history of the United States has
proven their wisdom.

      But our founders also believed deeply in faith. They created the Bill of Rights in large
measure to protect its free expression.

       They believed - and I believe - that we can protect against the establishment of religion
without infringing in any way on its free exercise. That belief is at the very heart of our
Constitution. And we must keep on working to make it a reality in our public life.

       The separation of church and state has been good for all concerned - good for religion,
good for government, good for those who choose not to worship at all. It is our freedom from
persecution, our absolute and unassailable choice of how to worship, that keeps religion strong.

       But it is our religious values that help keep our nation strong. That is why we must
always reexamine that crucial balance. Have we gone too far in discouraging faith in our public
discourse and personal lives? Have we gone too far in promoting faith and religious values?

        In our founders' day, the greatest need was to protect the unbeliever from religious
coercion. Today, we also need to ensure that believers of all faiths are free to engage in our
national dialogue and our pressing social challenges -- without feeling that they must hide their
religious beliefs.

V. FOUR PRINCIPLES FOR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS

        I want to suggest four simple principles to strengthen and sustain faith and religious
values in America, while holding fast to our cherished Constitutional freedoms.

       First, our laws and institutions should not impede or hinder, but rather should protect and
preserve our fundamental religious liberties.

       Second, the government should be held to a very high level of proof before it interferes
with someone's free exercise of religion.

       Third, whenever possible, we should help to explain and clarify the fullest allowable
expression of religious beliefs that is consistent with our Constitution.



                                                 5


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
faith proves a unique and effective role in meeting our most intractable social problems.

VI. NEW POLICY PROPOSALS

       Today, I would like to propose two concrete actions we can take to strengthen and
promote faith-based values and approaches in our nation - by strengthening our faith-based
organizations.

        The 1996 welfare reform law contained a little-known provision called "Charitable
Choice." It says, simply, that states can enlist faith-based organizations to provide basic welfare
services, and help move people from welfare to work.

        As long as there is always a secular alternative for anyone who wants one, and as long as
no one is required to participate in religious observances as a condition for receiving services,
faith-based organizations can provide jobs and job training, counseling and mentoring, food and
basic medical care. They can do so with public funds - imd without having to alter the religious
character that is so often the key to their effectiveness.

       I believe we should explore a similar, carefully-tailored extension of this approach to vital
services where faith plays a unique and effective role - such as drug treatment, homelessless, and
youth violence prevention.

        This extension must be accompanied by clear and strict safeguards: government must
never promote a particular religious view, or force anyone to receive faith. We must ensure that
there is always a high-quality secular choice available. We must prohibit direct proselytizing as '
part of any publicly-funded efforts. And we must establish clear accountability for results.

        But we must not be afraid to embrace faith-based approaches that advance our shared
goals as Americans.

        There is one more step we should take. It is currently common practice for employees at
an average company to contribute to a wide range of charities, and have their donations matched
by the company up to an annual limit. But rarely are faith-based programs approved for such
matches, perhaps because we are just starting to realize the role they are playing. I call on the
corporations of America to encourage and match contributions to faith- and values-based
organizations. We need to make sure their efforts are recognized and supported, across America.

VII. CONCLUSION

       America's national identity is not shaped solely by Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim
or Hindu traditions. But we are a people who believe that these and other faith traditions
contribute to the formation of values with which we agree to live out our common lives together.


                                                 6

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion




             I am a Baptist. My faith has always sustained me; I believe in serving God and trying to
     understand and obey God's will for our lives. That belief is what led me to explore my own faith
     in Divinity School when I returned from Vietnam. And throughout my life, it has called me to
     try to deepen my understanding of the human soul, and bring my actions, thoughts, and feelings
     into harmony with God's will.

             I want to create the kind of America where people can practice their faith, and use
     religious insights to illuminate all the questions our society is asking: how do we respect one
     another and live in peace and safety in our neighborhoods? How do we preserve and strengthen
     our families? How do we teach our children to live together? How do we give hope to the
     hopeless, and help to the helpless? How do we protect the weak - and teach restraint to the
     strong?

            Mother Theresa once said, "Plant the act, reap the habits. Plant the habits, reap the virtue.
     Plant the virtue, reap the character. Plant the character, reap the destiny."

            Religion helps to give our people the character without which a democracy
     cannot survive.

             Through our faith and our best values, we can become an America that is not just better
     off, but better. And in so doing, we can serve as I believe God meant us to -- as a light to this
     ever-shrinking world. Thank you.
