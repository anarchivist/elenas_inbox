TEXT:
In light of the meeting this morning, I took it on myself to fiddle with the
signing statment so as to include something about the food stamp/legal immigrant
problem.  I would suggest the following:
In the second pargapraph on p. 3, after the phrase "no fault of their own," add:
 "Neither should they be deprived of food stamp assistance when they have
applied for citizenship and are only awaiting governmental approval of their
applications."
Then, at the end of that paragraph, add: "In addition, I will take all possible
executive action to ensure that applicants for citizenship do not lose benefits
pending action on their naturalization applications."
What do you think?
