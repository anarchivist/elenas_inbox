TEXT:
Thought you should see this.   I wouldn't mind something in the cover note
to the effect that Bob believes the "base community" will be unhappy.   We
probably should have said that in out memo -- and still can if you want.

Subject:          Sentencing recommendations.

I have been tracking this issue for some time and I don't think the latest
recommendations are going to sit well in the base community.  Most people
I talk to see this as a fairness issue.  they want both drugs to get equal
punishment.   At the very least, they want the disparity closed.
Politically it may not be possible to get it down to a one to one ratio,
but we need to be move more in that direction especially now that we are
engaged on the race initiative.

In view of the political realities, I recommend 50 grams of crack be the
threshold for the 5 year sentence. Additionally, 100 grams of powder
cocaine should be the other threshold. According to local law enforcement
authorities both drugs cost about the same per gram.  The only difference
is one drug is in heavy use by young blacks and the other by mostly
whites.
