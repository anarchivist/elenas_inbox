Subject:         Affirmative action meeting

I will let you know by the end of the day, but we are probably going to
meet with Wade et al., on Thursday morning regarding affirmative action.
We are still juggling times, but we are going to try for 10 a.m.   Please
let me know if you are free to attend this meeting?
