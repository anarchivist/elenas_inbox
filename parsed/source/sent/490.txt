         MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

         FROM:         DON BAER

         SUBJECT:      SATURDAY   MESSAGE STRATEGY MEETING


          This Saturday, I would like to hold a follow-up to last weekD,s meeting,
         to continue developing message events that will carry us from late March
         through the month of April.  The meeting will be held from 12:30 to 2:00
         p.m. in OEOB room 180.

          In particular, the offices and individuals responsible for the following
         issues should be prepared to discuss events and ideas that emphasize these
         priorities:

           Education (DPC)
           Balancing the Budget (NEC)
           Welfare-to-Work (DPC)
           Campaign Finance Reform (RE)

          It is also important to consider events to build-up to two upcoming
         events:

           The White House Conference on Early Childhood Development, April 17
         (DPC/HRC)
           The National Service Summit, April 27-29 (SM/SS)

          Additionally, we should consider possibilities for Earth Day (April 22),
         which provides an opportunity to launch the PresidentD,s American Heritage
         Rivers initiative.  SaturdayD,s meeting will not include discussion of
         foreign policy, which we expect to proceed along a separate track.



   At our last meeting, the policy councils and Cabinet Affairs agreed to
  prepare lists of policy and event options; these should be submitted to
  Eli Attie (6-5638) as soon as possible, in anticipation of SaturdayO,s
  meeting.
