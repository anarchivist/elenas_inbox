TEXT:
I'm sending you over a proposal from the CBC on establishing community
computer centers. Maxine Waters is very hot to do something about this,
and the President told the CBC last week that he thought it was a great
idea.   Frank Raines (whom Waters has talked with a couple of times about
the issue) is quite receptive, so we're likely to have OMB's active
cooperation. We'd like you to take the lead in getting people from OMB,
the VP' s office, and .the relevant agencies together and making something
come of this.   You might also involve the people in Leg Affs who keep most
directly in touch with the CBC. And keep Jose in the loop.     Let me know
what's happening and what you come up with. Thanks.
