from the harm caused by tobacco products. Two months ago, a court in North Carolina issued a
landmark ruling confirming my decision that the Food and Drug Administration has authority to
regulate tobacco products to protect our children's health. These victories for the public health
drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table and extracted concessions from them that
would have seemed unimaginable just a short time ago.

       I want to commend the attorneys general and other people working with them, including
public health advocates, for their hard work in negotiating this proposed agreement. They have
devoted great time and energy to continuing our struggle to protect the health of children, and
they deserve our thanks for doing so.

        We must now carefully consider whether approving this proposed settlement will protect
the public health -- and particularly our children's health -- to the greatest extent possible. Until
now, we have not had the opportunity to review the actual terms of the agreement, and we have
not concluded whether it is in the best interests of the public health. Over the next several weeks,
we will undertake a thorough public health review. I am asking Bruce Reed, my Domestic Policy
Advisor -- along with Donna Shalala, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
-- to engage in extensive consultations with the public health community and to subject this
agreement to the strictest scrutiny. They will report to me on whether this agreement represents
the best means of protecting the nation's public health interests.

         In the meantime, we will fight as hard as ever to ensure that the FDA rule stands. Each
day, 3,000 young people become regular smokers; 1,000 of them will have their lives cut short as
a result. Protecting the health ofthe public and these children will be our measure of this
proposed agreement.
