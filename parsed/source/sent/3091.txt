TEXT:
The language I proposed to Janno -- to replace the first bullitt in the Oct. 5
draft of the SAP on HR 1788 -- is as follows:
"Provide a transition period for replacing the current Amtrak Board of Directors
by applying the appointment me~hanism proposed in the bill to vacancies as and
when they arise.  Such a transition period will prevent needless disruption of
Amtrak's reform efforts."
Let me know anything you find out about the call between Pena and Harold.  Ab
seemed pretty out out this morning when I told him about it.  He believes that
Pena's position (i.e., just to keep the current appointment mechanism) is
untenable and that the compromise position (i.e., to phase in a new appointments
mechanism over time) is the most sensible solution.
