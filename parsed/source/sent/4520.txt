In addition to continuing our efforts to expand charter schools, the President's budget
provides several additional approaches to expanding public school choice to provide
alternatives to conventional public schools and help promote school integration, especially
for students in urban school systems:

   Continuing to Expand Charter Schools. The President's budget contains a $30 million
   increase in charter schools funding, to $130 million. This will enable the federal
   government to support the development, start up and initial operation of an estimated
   2,200 schools, and keep us on track to 3,000 charter schools by 2002.

   Work-Site Schools. The President's FY 2000 budget proposes a new $10 million·
   demonstration program to about 100 school districts to support partnerships to create
   public schools located at work sites. About 30 of these schools have been constructed
   since 1987, and most operate as public-private partnerships. Typically, the employer
   pays for the school facility, utilities, and maintenance, while the school district provides
   the teachers, curriculum and instructional materials. The work-site schools are paired
   with "host" neighborhood schools that provide administrative support and share other
   resources such as art and music teachers. Because the school is located at the parent's
   work site, these schools typically have extremely high rates of parent involvement --
   which is a key factor in increasing student achievement. These schools also enable
   school districts to relieve overcrowding at low cost and can often promote diversity (as
   workplaces are often more diverse than neighborhoods).

   Interdistrict Magnet Schools. The President'sFY 2000 budget proposal also includes a
   $10 million increase in an existing grant program that allows two or more school
   districts to develop high-quality special programs at schools that are open to all
   students from participating districts to reduce racial isolation. This expansion would
   be targeted toward urban districts with high concentrations of minority and poor
   students that partner with suburban districts. This increase would fund 5-10 grants to
   states for planning and implementation activities, including curriculum development,
   teacher training, student recruitment, and instructional personnel, equipment, extended
   day instructional activities and public information efforts to promote and explain these
   programs to affected communities.

   High Schools Located on Community College Campuses. The President's FY 2000
   budget includes a $5 million expansion of a demonstration program to co-locate high
   schools and community colleges, while providing high school students with
   opportunities to enroll in college courses for credit. In addition to broadening the
   course offerings for high school students, locating schools on college campuses would
   complement the goals of the GEAR UP program, by sparking college aspirations of low
   income students and facilitating mentoring and tutoring programs.

About 30 work-site satellite schools have been constructed since 1987, built on corporate campuses and
even in malls (3M, Mall of America). Most work-site satellite schools are K-2 or 3, but some have
expanded to K-5. Teachers and principals report extraordinary levels of parent involvement which they
believe contribute to high academic achievement. Approximately 10 additional work-site schools are
currently in development across the nation. States with Work-Site Schools: Florida, Minnesota,
California, Texas, Iowa. (largest numbers in Florida and Minnesota). Delaware recently passed a law
to allow work -site schools.

American Bankers Insurance Group (Miami, FL). The nations's first work-site public school - it has
been in existence since 1987. ABIG has spent $2.5 million on a facility that houses 200 kindergarten
to fifth grade students. The school is run by the Miami-Dade school district, which provides teachers
and pays their salaries. ABIG is responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the facility. The school
offers both before- and after-school programs. ABIG estimates that it saves $475,000/year - more
than three times the $140,000 it costs to run the school - because it has reduced employee turnover
and absenteeism. Job turnover among parents of children attending the school is 6 percent, compared
with 13.3 percent at the company overall. The AB~G Satellite School received a Florida Schools of
Excellence award, given to schools that meet the state standards and raise the achievement levels of its
students for 2 years and across ail racial categories.

3M- (Minneapolis, MN.) The Eastside Workplace Kindergarten is located in a strip mall near the
corporate headquarters and serves children in grades K-l. The company reports that it has outstanding
parent participation and as well as high volunteer participation from other company employees. The
vast majority of the students are children of employees, the remaining children are from the
surrounding neighborhood.

Hewlett-Packard (Santa Rosa, CAl. HP opened a work-site school at its corporate headquarters in
1993. The Company invested $400,000 to build the public school satellite location. The 2.4 acre
school site is leased to the school district for $1 for 10 years. About 80 of the 120 students (grades
K-3) are children of employees. The school is a satellite location of the Hidden Valley Elementary
School. The absenteeism rate at this school (3.3 ) is the lowest in the district (avg. 6.9 ) and test
scores are high. Turnover is 50 lower for workers with children enrolled than those in the general
population.

Nations Bank - (Jacksonville, FL.) NationsBank reports almost 100 parent participation in the school.
 The school was initially launched by Barnett Bank which merged into NationsBank. About 30
children left the school after th'eir parents changed jobs -- they were allowed to finish the school year at
the school if they chose to do so. 25 of the student body is African-American as are a third of its
teachers. Duval County's office of academic programs considers the work-site schools to be "an
overwhelming, unqualified success."

Downtown School (Des Moines, IA.) A group called the Business/Education Alliance opened the
Downtown school in August 1993. It serves 144 pupils in K-5. Located in an office building, the
public school serves employees' children of 19 sponsoring businesses joined by a network of skywalks.
 The companies pay the cost of hOllsing the schools, which has small class sizes and a longer school
year.

'.

     Other companies with work-site schools: Mall of America, Miami International Airport, Radission Hotel,
     Honeywell, Florida Power & Light, and Target Stores.

     Inter-District Magnet School Example:

      New Haven, CT.
     The city of New Haven has five interdistrict magnet schools: each has between 20 percent and
     30 percent suburban students. Among the interdistrict schools are Jepson, the only nongraded
     school in the state; the Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School; the long-running High
     School in the Community; the Career High School, which emphasizes work experience; and the
     Hyde Leadership School, scheduled to open this fall with a focus on character development. The
     federal government has provided $2 million in grant money annually for New Haven's magnet
     schools.

     Other communities wi interdistrict magnets: Minneapolis, MN; St. Louis MO.
