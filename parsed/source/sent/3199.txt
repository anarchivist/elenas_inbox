TEXT:
Thanks for forwarding Sally Katzen's message on reg reform; I don't understand
why I wasn't already on the circulation list.  In any event, I should be now,
and I'll keep you informed.
sorry for not returning your messages Tuesday.  I went home when the snow began
co get heavy again and wasn't here yesterday either.   I hope nothing important??
