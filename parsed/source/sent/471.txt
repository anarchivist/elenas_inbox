MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                         LYNHOGAN

SUBJECT:                 WELF ARE-TO-WORK IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

        As you know, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) recently sent us a memo
outlining numerous proposals for ensuring that federal agencies hire welfare recipients. Based on
this memo and our conversations with OPM staff, we suggest the following package of measures.

         1. Create a new hiring avenue for welfare recipients. Through executive order, you
would create new excepted service hiring authori!y for welfare recipients. This new hiring track
would provide welfare recipients with non-competitive service appointments (at any grade level),
which the agency would convert to normal competitive service positions after two years of
satisfactory performance. The executive order also would instruct agencies to provide employees
in this hiring track with any necessary job-specific training, as well as with a mentor or peer
counselor.

        In considering this option, you should note that the federal goverrunent currently has five
similar excepted service programs, each targeted to a specific group and boasting simplified
hiring procedures: the Veteran's Readjustment Appointment Program; the Severely Handicapped
Appointment Program; the Presidential Management Intern Program; the Student Career
Experience Program; and the Worker-Trainee Program. As an alternative to creating a separate
hiring track for welfare recipients, you could direct agencies to use the already existing Worker-
Trainee Program; we are concerned, however, that this approach would not focus sufficient
attention -- or effort -- on the need to hire welfare recipients.

               Approve: __                           Disapprove __

        2. Call for performance goals and offer federal agencies incentives for hiring welfare
recipients. Through executive order or memorandum, you would direct each federal agency to
set, and transmit to you, hiring goals for welfare recipients. You also would require each agency
to report monthly on its progress, and you would recognize, perhaps through a kind of honor roll,
the federal agencies that succeed best in hiring people off welfare.

               Approve: __                   Disapprove: __

       You also might consider calling for a legislative change that would provide agencies with


                                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                                               Hex.Dump Conversion

a monetary incentive to hire welfare recipients. Under current law, federal agencies cannot take
advantage of subsidies offered to employers who hire welfare recipients, because agencies may
not receive any unappropriated funds. A simple piece of legislation would allow federal agencies
to accept and retain these subsidies, thus giving agencies the same incentives to hire welfare
recipients as other employers. This proposal, however, might well provoke opposition, with
some arguing that the states should not have to pay the federal government to put welfare
recipients to work.

        3. Adopt new ways to publicize federal job opportunities and match potential employees
to job positions. Your executive order would direct OPM to initiate a system to inform state and
local social service providers of federal job opportunities and to assist providers in matching
welfare recipients to these opportunities. This system, in addition to making use of direct
mailings, would focus on a range of on-line services, including: USAJOBS, OPM's employment
information homepage which provides access to a full list of federal job openings and application
materials; and USACAREERS, a new on-line career counseling system, ready for use in March,
which can assist in matching welfare recipients to suitable positions in the federal government.

        A recent NGAJ APWA survey found that approximately 40 percent of welfare
caseworkers now have access to such internet services. HHS estimates that hooking up the
remaining caseworkers would cost about $35 million over two years, including maintenance and
training. You could direct that HHS, working with GSA, undertake this responsibility (assuming
OMB could find this small amount of money). Making sure that state and local social serVice
providers have access to these new technologies would assist not only the federal government,
but also other employers in hiring welfare recipients.

               Approve: _ _                  Disapprove: __

         4. Provide needed services to welfare recipients. You could take several actions to help
welfare recipients keep their jobs by providing them with supporting services. First, you could
direct agencies to offer public transportation subsidies to low-income employees under the
existing Federal Fare Subsidy Program. Very few agencies now use this program because the
cost of subsidizing public transportation costs for all employees is prohibitive. You could make
clear that agencies have legal authority to offer graduated subsidies based on income and direct
agencies to do so. Subsidies would come out of the participating agency's appropriations and go
directly into the employee's paycheck. Second, you could instruct agencies to determine the
feasibility of establishing more agency-sponsored child care centers and report back to you on
their findings. Third, you could direct agencies to inform all employees eligible for the EITC of
both their eligibility and their ability to get EITC monies each month in their paychecks.
