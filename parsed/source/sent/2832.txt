   Subject:         ESEA -- anti-smoking programs

   This is to pass on to you, from Randy Moss, a concern re the forthcoming
   ESEA reauthorization proposal that OLC expressed to Dept of Education, was
   rebuffed, and wants the White House to be aware of for our consideration.
            The proposed bill, as I understand from Randy, would condition
   substantial ESEA funding on the states'adoption of school anti-smoking
   programs. OLC has no problem with tying some ESEA funding to state
   antismoking programs, but worries about proportionality -- i.e., whether
   the sanction for not adopting the anti-smoking programs, in terms of loss
   of all ESEA funding, is too large given the small size of the antismoking
   program.    They recommended to Dept of Ed that they put only a smaller
   subset of ESEA funding at risk. The OLC recommendation was made, not
   because they think the original proposal is indefensible, but to reduce
   litigation risk.    For in the Supreme Court's leading decision on this
   issue, South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 211 (1987), the Court, while
   upholding the legitimacy in general of using federal funds as an
   inducement to states to do what the feds want, warned that "in some
   circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so
   coercive as to pass the point at which 'pressure turns into compUlsion. '"

           Dept of Ed said no, and they and we may well feel that
   anti-smoking stuff is important enough that we want a big
   club/inducement.    Randy and OLC think we'd be safer if we tailored to
   sanction more. They are not saying this is a "must" (and they are not
   retaliating for Helms.v. Picard !), but wanted to see what we think.
            I personally doubt that the risk is great enough here -- given the
   popularity of school antismoking programs -- to justify pressing this
     ,..   ,
       point, but you guys can decide!
