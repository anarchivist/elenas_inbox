                                         Draft February 24, 1998

    MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

    FROM:          GENE SPERLING, BRUCE REED

    RE:            ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON SKILLED TEMPORARY FOREIGN
                   WORKERS

    We are providing you with this infonnational memo on the "HI-B visa" issue because the New
    York Times recently ran a story on the basis of a leaked internal Administration options memo,
    and because this is an important topic to Silicon Valley companies. You will be interacting with
    high-tech CEOs during your California trip later this week, and may get asked about this. A
    suggested Q&A is attached.

    Current U.S. law pennits 65,000 HI-B visas each year for skilled temporary foreign workers.
    The computer and health care industries are the primary users of the HI-B program. The annual
    65,000 visa cap was met for the first time in FY 1997. We expect to reach the limit again in May
    or June, several months before the end of the current fiscal year. Accordingly, the cap is likely to
    become a legislative issue in this session of Congress.

    The infonnation technology (IT) industry, along with Senator Abraham, Representative Zoe
    Lofgren, and other members of Congress, support either the removal of or a significant increase
    in the HI-B cap. Unions, other worker organizations, Senator Kennedy, Congressman Dingell,
    and other members of Congress are likely to oppose any increase.

    A DPCINEC working group with representatives from' Labor; Commerce, State, and INS has
    started to meet to develop Administration policy on:

    1.     Steps we can take to work with industry and institutions of higher education to address
           the shortage of workers with IT skills;

    2.     Refonns of the HI-B program (e.g. a prohibition against laying off U.S. workers to
           replace them with foreign workers); and

    3.     Whether or not to increase the HI-B cap from its current level of 65,000.




                                                     1


                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
skills of American workers, and not on proposing an increase in the cap at this point. For
example, we successfully addressed concerns about the shortage of shipbuilder workers in
Louisiana by bringing together industry, labor, and state and local elected officials. We
ultimately determined that rather than a 10,000 worker shortage, the industry needed less than
1,000 temporary foreign workers.

As part of an overall package -- industry commitments to upgrade worker skills and reform of the
HI-B visa system -- the interagency group is willing to consider an increase in the HI-B cap ifit
is truly necessary. However, we do not think that it makes any tactical sense to start with this as
our publicly stated position. Furthermore, even a 20,000 to 35,000 increase in the H-IB cap is
not likely to solve the problem, given the projected growth in demand for workers with IT skills.


Our next step is to meet with high-tech industry executives to develop an "action plan" that
builds on a series of announcements that the Departments of Commerce, Education and Labor
made at a January 1998 conference in Berkeley, California.

Q. Mr. President, will your Administration grant more visas to high-skilled foreign
workers who are in demand by high-tech industries?

We have made no decision on this issue. In reviewing our options, my Administration's first
priority will be to ensure that American workers have the skills they need to fill these jobs, and
that they have priority over any foreign workers with similar training. The growing demand for
workers with high-tech skills shows how critical my agenda for life-long learning is -- HOPE
scholarships to open the doors of college, tax credits for employer investment in life-long
learning, and making sure that all of our children are technologically literate.
