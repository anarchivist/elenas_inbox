        Well, it's not very very long.  But (1) we've told him about many of the
        items on our list already, (2) we should keep some in reserve (there's
        next week and the week after that and ... ), and (3) we shouldn't tell him
        yet the ideas that we're not sure will work out.   I think it's a pretty
        good report.  My favorite is item (1), which Dennis gets credit for making
        happen and I claim credit for including.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

CC:                      ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:                    BRUCE REED

SUBJECT:                 DPC WEEKLY REPORT

        1. ABC Radio Town Hall. During the March 12 ABC Radio Town Hall on drugs, a
student named Mikisha Bonner told you that an open-air drug market operates across the street
from her school. You told her that you would look into what could be done. In response to your
request, General McCaffrey's staff contacted the DEA. Working with the Metropolitan Police
Department, the DEA now has expanded an ongoing investigation in the vicinity of the open-air
drug market. The DEA will keep General McCaffrey informed of the status of this investigation.

        2. Education Standards. On Monday, the organization of Chief State School Officers -
- as well as a number of individual members -- will endorse your testing proposal. (You are
currently scheduled to meet with the School Officers on Monday, along with the Vice President
and Secretary Riley.) The following Monday (March 24), during your trip to California,
California Superintendent Delaine Eastin and a group of Silicon Valley high-tech executives also
will endorse your proposal. California's endorsement is very important because the State has 10-
15% of the country's schoolchildren. We are currently considering whether you should give a
speech in California attcking both the Ebonics movement and English-Only)nitiatives.

       3. Service Scholars. You are currently scheduled to do an event on March 27 to launch
the National Service Scholars Program, which you announced last year at Penn State. The
program will provide $1,000 scholarships for high school students who have performed
outstanding service, with the federal government putting up $500 and a community or service
organization (e.g., Lions, Elks, Kiwanis, Moose) putting up the rest. You will issue an invitation
to school principals to nominate students for the scholarship and probably announce some
commitments for matching grants as well.

        4. National Anti-Drug Media Campaign: Your FY 98 budget includes $175 million
for a national anti-drug media campaign directed towards our youth. ONDCP can start this
campaign right now by using discretionary funds in its FY 97 budget. We would like you to kick
off the campaign next month at a Rose Garden event with one of the celebrities who has agreed
to appear in an ad. ONDCP is currently reaching out to celebrities and sports figures such as
Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, and Tiger Woods; if Michael Jordan agrees, we should aim to have
the event when the Chicago Bulls visit the White House on April 3. At the same time, you


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion

should release a letter to every network challenging them to match the federal government's
contribution and begin dedicating more air time to anti-drug ads.

       5. Welfare business group announcement. Eli Segal is planning a formal
announcement of his organization in early April. He thinks he should make this announcement
in Milwaukee, where he can line up the support of a few hundred businesses, Mayor Norquist,
Governor Thompson, and the head of Manpower (Mitch Fromstein). This event is tentatively
shceduled for April 7.

       6. Business endorsement of kids' coverage. We are working on an event at which
important representatives of the business community endorse our proposal to extend health care
coverage for children. We think we can have this event ready sometime in April.

        7. Victims Constitutional Amendment: In June 1996, you announced your support for
a constitutional amendment to guarantee victims the right to be notified, to receive restitution and
reasonable protection measures, and to be heard at sentencing and parole hearings. We are
working on an event at which you would: (1) urge Congress to pass the Amendment quickly; (2)
receive a report from the Attorney General, in response to your June 1996 directive, outlining
measures taken by the Justice Department to increase and improve Federal services and
protections for victims of crime; (3) announce the creation of a Federal victim notification
system; and (4) announce that additional funding from the Victims' Crime Fund will be provided
to victims' services and shelters throughout the country. The event could be held on April 19,
which is the third anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, or the week of April 14 to 18,
which is National Crime Victims' Week.

        8. Medical Records Privacy. We are working with HHS to develop legislation that will
protect the confidentiality of medical records and guard against inappropriate use of genetic
screening information, while not frustrating legitimate medical research. The subject is complex,
but we have this initiative on a fast track and should be ready to announce legislation in early
May.

                                                                       Hex-Dwnp Conversion
