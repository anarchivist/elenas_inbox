TEXT:
This proposal will address racial disparities in six carefully selected
areas: infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer, heart disease and
stroke, diabetes, AIDS, and immunization.  The proposal will include
nationwide measures on each of the six health conditions to go onto effect
in the next two years, as well as intensive five-year pilot projects in
thirty communities focused on one or another of the six conditions (say, a
project on diabeteas on an Indian reservation or a project on AIDS in an
inner city). The stated aim of the proposal will be to eliminate racial
disparities in these six areas by 2010.

Sorry this is so late.  Could you send me the paragraph on Chakka Fattah
just so I could look it over? Thanks.
