        The Administration believes that federal tobacco legislation must affirm the full and
immediate authority ofthe FDA to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco
products. Under the legislation, the FDA's jurisdiction over these products must be as great as
its authority over other drugs and devices. The FDA must be able to regulate tobacco products --
including by ordering the reduction or elimination of nicotine or other constituents -- based on an
appropriately thorough and reasoned assessment, of the kind required for regulation generally,
that doing so will reduce the risk of the product to the public. The legislation may not impose
any obligation on the FDA to make specific findings about such speculative matters as the
creation of contraband markets. Neither may the legislation impose any special procedural
hurdles or requirements, such as enhanced standards of proof or unusual evidentiary formalities,
on the FDA's regulation oflobacco products.


Changing the Way The Industry Does Business

        Federal tobacco legislation must include measures to expose the industry's past
misconduct, especially efforts to market products to children, and to change the way the industry
does business. Voluntary commitments on the part of the industry -- such as agreements to limit
advertising to children -- can indicate increased corporate responsibility. But legislation is
needed to ensure that patterns of corporate malfeasance are disclosed and effectively checked in
the future.

        To this end, legislation must provide for broad disclosure of industry documents,
especially those containing scientific or other health information or relating to the industry's
attempts to market tobacco to children. This legislation should respect the attorney-client
privilege, which is one of the great gifts of our legal heritage. But the legislation should establish
effective mechanisms to turn over to the public all non-privileged documents (including the
many documents the industry has falsely claimed to be privileged), as well as to disclose all
scientific and health-related information in even privileged documents.

         Legislation also must require tobacco companies to set up comprehensive corporate
compliance programs that will reinforce the real economic incentives provided by the youth
smoking penalties (see above) to discourage companies from marketing to children. Further, the
legislation should institute full protection for whistleblowers and establish oversight mechanisms
to investigate and monitor corporate behavior and to make recommendations to Congress on
appropriate future legislation.


Meeting Other Public Health Goals

       Federal tobacco legislation provides an opportunity not only to reduce youth smoking, but
to meet other public health goals: the reduction of environmental (i.e., second-hand) tobacco
smoke, the expansion of smoking cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to


                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion




           control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other health objectives.

                   Federal tobacco legislation should include provisions to restrict smoking in workplaces
           and other public facilities ofthe kind found in H.R. 3434, as well as in the President's recent
           Executive Order on tobacco smoke in federal facilities. The best scientific studies show that this
           measure would reduce the risk of death and injury to non-smokers, including hundreds of
           thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illness, and would lead many smokers to
           quit the habit.

                  Legislation also should provide sufficient funds to enable smoking cessation programs
           and services to reach and assist the millions of smokers who want to break their addiction to
           tobacco products. Data suggests that some 70% of smokers want to quit, but less than 25% now
           successfully do so.

                    Legislation should strengthen the Administration's leadership role in global and bilateral
           efforts to reduce smoking by providing assistance to international organizations such as the
           World Health Organization. According to the WHO, tobacco use now causes 3 million deaths a
           year worldwide; unless checked, that number will rise to 10 million by 2025, with 75% of annual
           deaths occurring in developing countries.

                  Finally, legislation should generate enough additional resources to establish a medical
           research fund and further other important health objectives. The Administration believes that
           tobacco legislation should be viewed primarily not as a means of raising money, but of
           improving the public -- and especially our children's -- health. Nonetheless, tobacco legislation
           should take into account the costs that the industry has wreaked on society. In particular, the
           amount of money payable to the public cannot be decreased by the amount of the excise tax
           imposed in the balanced budget.


           Next Steps

                   The Administration wishes to pursue legislation along these lines in a cooperative and
           bipartisan manner, and to work with dispatch toward a comprehensive industry-wide solution.
           The President will soon invite leaders and other key members of both parties to the White House
           to communicate his approach to tobacco legislation and to get this process underway as soon as
           possible.
