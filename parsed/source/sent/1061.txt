READ: UNKNOWN

TEXT:
1. The part of your weekly entry on the civil rights community (i.e., the
issue of giving an english-only reading test) didn't make it into this
week's memo. Whenever you think it makes sense (i.e., when there's some
kind of hook, even if it's only a meeting), could you give me something on
this again? -- I do think we should make the President aware of this issue.

2. CEA seems to be doing some kind of analysis on the likely effects of
HOPE scholarships - - i". e., a why-the-critics -are-wrong study. I'm not
sure who the staff member is. You should call Michelle Jolin, the Chief
of Staff there, and get yourself plugged in (and then, of course, keep me
and Bruce informed of CEA's progress).

Many thanks.
