Policy Rationale and Cost: Advancing food safety is one of the Administration's signature
issues and this year's initiative would maintain our leadership in the area.by working to establish
a nationally integrated food safety system with Federal, state, and local authorities. The initiative
includes measures by FDA, USDA and CDC.

 FDA: The majority of FDA's request ($25.6 million) would go toward expansion of their
inspection and compliance capability. As part of its efforts to integrate efforts with non-
federal agencies, FDA will enter into contracts and partnerships so that states will follow
FDA guidelines and procedures. Among the tangible goals FDA states they could accomplish
if the initiative were funded: for the first time in decades, FDA will ensure that every high risk
food manufacturer in the United States is inspected at least once a year; for other food firms,
inspections will be twice as often as today (from once every 8 years to once every 4 years) and
for the first time ever, state and Federal inspection results will be shared, via an electronic
connection, that will reduce overlapping efforts and greatly enhance the ability of those
authorities to improve public health. The measure also boosts our international capability so that
FDA will increase the number of international inspections from 100 to 250 and will conduct
evaluations of foreign food production systems. In addition, FDA seeks $9.0 million
improving its traceback capabilities; $6.9 million for new research programs and $2.7 for
risk assessment; and $4.7 million in new education funding. (Cost: $48.9 million over the
FY99 request.)

CDC: The goal is to create a national system that provides comprehensive data on the
occurrence of food-borne illness that can be used by agencies at every level to combat food-
borne illness. The majority of the investment is targeted toward surveillance activities,
specifically expanding the scope of FoodNet and the capacity of PulseNet to better capture
pathogen DNA fingerprints of both E. coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis and include
more state health departments in the network. This expanded surveillance network is the
heart of our nation's food-borne disease early warning system. The current surveillance
system does not provide adequate coverage of the US popUlation. (Cost: $18 million over
the FY99 request.)

USDA: USDA complains that while OMB more than fully funded their initiative, they
imposed $473 million in user fees on FSIS and failed to provide a needed $30.6 million for
obligated salary increases and redeployment of inspectors. This is on top of a flat budget
when the agency is trying to implement extensive new HACCP reforms. FSIS has very
little discretionary money, since most is tied up in inspector salaries and other fixed costs.
USDA has stated that OMB's failure to include the $30.6 million will force them to shut
down the inspection program during the last 9 days of the year or furlough over 300
employees. The Secretary has sent a letter complaining that the lack of salary funds
effectively downsizes his inspection force and undercuts the commitment the President
made to improve food safety and effectively regulate meat and poultry. (Cost: The salary
increases and inspector redeployment cost $30.6 million).

                                                                  Automat ed R
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

USDA. The USDA/OMB dispute on user fees is an old one, and USDA acknowledges they
will probably lose again. USDA may suggest a compromise they think OMB might agree
to: include the full funding request for FSIS in the budget ($652 million) but elsewhere in
the budget acknowledge that the Administration expects user fees to cover $473 million of
the cost. The argument being that currently Congress is not technically being requested to
provide the actual amount the Administration and most observers think it really needs.


Vetting.

     These proposals have been developed by the USDA, FDA, and CDC and explained
to OMB. OSTP has also been involved in their development.

        We have not consulted with consumer groups, but it seems likely they would
strongly support the initiative. The groups have called us to support the idea that there be
some new initiative, and to complain in general about user fees. It seems likely we will get
significant flack for the user fees from Congress and consumer groups, especially if we
have no new initiative.
