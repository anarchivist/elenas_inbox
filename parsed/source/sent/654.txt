I'm meeting with Diane tomorrow about her future.       COuld you give me a
call on this.

And to follow up on the Brownfields meeting - I gather Bruce did not even
attempt to make it clear we have the lead on this - lumping us with OMB
and others as having an interest. This is not acceptable over the long
term. Perhaps we'll start calling meetings on welfare to work - and then
just tell you when you squawk that of course we're just working with you
and because of the COS directive on cross-cutting initiatives it just
makes sense for us to get the environmental agencies involved.

Let's cut this off before it really gets ridiculous. Surely you and. I can
work something out .
