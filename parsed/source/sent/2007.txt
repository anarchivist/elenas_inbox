Subject: Cloning update.

I want to revisit a decision we made last week not to reach out to
groups.   I have heard that the Rs are hard at work.  In meetings, they
have made it clear they will bring cloning up again as soon as they can
regroup. The Rs have also begun leaning on the groups that worked our
side of the issue and reminding them who controls the fate of the rest of
the groups' legislative agendas.   I recommend that we conv~ne a meeting of
the groups to rally continued support and brief them on issues such as FDA
jurisdiction.   Let me know if you agree, and I will work with OPL to set
this up. Thanks.
