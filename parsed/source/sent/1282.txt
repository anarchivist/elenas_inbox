 Charter Schools: The Pennsylvania legislature passed. a charter school law
 last week. We have not seen the final bill, but from what what we know
 now, it appears to be generally consistent with the principals underlying
 our charter schools program.  Several press accounts suggest that one
 factor featured in the debate over final passage is the fact that
 Pennsylvania would become eligible for several million dollars in federal
 charter schools funds.  The bill passed with bipartisan support; an
 overwhelming majority of Republicans as well as a slim majority of
 Democrats, including a number of minority legislators from Philadelphia .

. The bill will be signed into law next week. We are checking to see if it
  will be possible for you to mark the occassion by releasing a Charter
  Schools Guide from the Education Department, and· highlighting the
  Department's newly created Charter Schools Web Site.
