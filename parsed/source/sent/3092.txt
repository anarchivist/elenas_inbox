TEXT:
I'd be perfectly amenable to that, and though I haven't talked to Ab, I suspect
he would be as well.  For different reasons, I think OLC also would go along:
because Dellinger likes the House proposal, he has always wanted to be silent on
this issue. The problem, if there is one, will come from DOT: Janno has told me
that he wants to use the SAP to lay down a marker on this issue -- to declare
that the appointments mechanism, as proposed in the House bill, is unacceptable.
(It was because I understood DOT to want something in the SAP that I offered the
substitute language -- though DOT now may prefer nothing at all.)  I suspect
Janno will urge us to object wholesale to the appointments provision, as the SAP
does now, with the idea in mind of eventually negotiating to the compromise
solution.  But if we do that, of course, OLC will object, and for what Ab
considers to be good reason.  My bottom line, in light of all this, is either to
do what you have suggested or to do what I have suggested (with a slight
preference for your suggestion over mine), but not to do what Janno has
suggested. What do you think? And how did the conversation go between Pena and
Harold?
