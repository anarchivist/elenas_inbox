yes, you're right.  Laura's out, so can you set up a meeting on FDA
jurisdiction for later this week? OHara will know who to bring from HHS.
we should also make sure OVP, OMB, and DOJ are represented.

Subject:         Today's Jeffords and McCain hearings

The news from today's hearings is that both chairmen said they will mark
up their bills
next week -- the dates weren't specific, but both implied next Tuesday.

I think we may need a meeting on the FDA jurisdiction issues Jeffords bill
raises -- i.e., do we oppose/support creating a separate title for tobacco
and switching jurisdiction from FDA to CDC? HHS seems to oppose both.
