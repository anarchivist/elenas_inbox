TEXT:
along the same lines, it's not clear to me that this is a major (or even a
minor) conflict of interest.  Presumably, they're arguing with the chinese
to open up trade to american companies.  that's exactly what their future
american clients will want them to be doing.  so the broad interests here
are not adverse, as the conflict of interest rules proscribe.
