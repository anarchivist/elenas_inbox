      Re:              Title IX/Equal Opportunities for Girls
                       and Women In Sports

      Because the President will be making remarks tomorrow regarding
      title IX, I have prepared the following memo. The memo includes
      brief background information on title IX and four points of
      controversy surrounding title IX that could be raised during Q&A.
      Background
      Title IX prohibits sexual discrimination at educational
      institutions that receive federal funds. It is part of the
      Education Amendments of 1972 that President Nixon signed into
      law.
      Title IX is used to provide equal opportunities for girls and
      women in school athletic programs. Most private colleges are
      subject to Title IX guidelines just as public colleges and
      universities are because both receive federal funds through
      financial aid programs such as Pell Grants.
      Ti tIe IX has paved the .way for female athletes and sparked a new
      level of excellence in women's sports. In this year's Olympics, a
      record
      o
      -setting total of about 3,700 women competed from here and
      abroad.
      Data show that girls who play sports in school have a reduced
      risk of becoming pregnant or dropping out of school, have higher
      levels of self
      o
      -esteem, and reduced risks for osteoporosis and
      breast cancer.
      Controversy Surrounding Title IX
      1) Since the Spring of 1992, several substantial law suits
      charging noncompliance with title IX have been brought against
      universities, the most notable of which is against Brown
      University.  Brown decided to reduce its financial support for
      the women's volleyball and gymnastics teams-
      o
      -instead asking them
      to raise some of their own funds. The Department of Justice filed
      an amicus brief in Cohen v. Brown University. The Court ruled
      against Brown. However Brown appealed and the suit continues.


      2)   More recently, members of the U.S. Congress argued that title


IX does not mean better opportunities for women athletes, but
rather destruction of men's athletic programs.  In 1995, Rep.
Dennis Hastert (R
o
-IL) organized House members to sign and send a
letter to the Department of Education calling for "common sense"
revisions to title IX such as to omitting men's football from
title IX regulations. The Department of Education agreed to
review title IX regulations.  Currently, the Office of civil
Rights of the Department of Education is working on guidelines
outlining what actions are appropriate to prevent sexual
harassment and discrimination in schools. The guidelines will be
issued sometime over the next two months.
3) A recent Texas court case determined that educational
institutions with knowledge of sexual harassment between students
that do not take corrective action are not violating title IX.
This decision has been very controversial and may advance to the
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is deciding this week whether or
not it will hear the case.
4)  For an institution to be Title IX compliant, it must show its
female student
o
-athlete ratio to be proportionate to its female
student population.  The NCAA conducted its own gender equity
probe in 1991 and found that over 80 percent of the dollars were
going to men's programs and that 75 percent of the athletes were
men.
