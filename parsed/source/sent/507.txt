yes, please on the TP and Q&A.   You should check in with Doug Walker from
OPM. They're supposed to be sending stuff over by 2:00.
I'll make the child care change.
We NEED the transportation piece.   Do I need to make a call?

Looks great!     You managed to turn my three cluncky pages into one.

On the child care, if we can, I'd lead with the resource and refferal
services. Both Faith Wohl and Joan Lombardi told me that the Federal
child care centers are really too expensive for many low-income people and
building new Federal centers is also too expensive.

They both think agencies really underuse the resource and refferal
agencies and that they are the cost-effective waive of the future.

I'm STILL waiting on Eric Dodds at GSA for a definitive answer on the
transportation piece . . 501-1104 if you want to call.

Next steps: As I said, I'm collecting fact sheets.stats to answer
questions.  Do you want me to drfat the usual talking points and Q&A for
press?
