TEXT:
I just received the brief filed by environmental groups in the above case, which
we talked about the other day.  The plaintiffs say that they need the injunction
reaffirmed because the logging rider in the Rescissions Act places the continued
force of the injunction in some doubt.   More specifically, the plaintiffs note
that in the wake of the Rescissions Act, a Forest Service memo listed sales
covered by the injunction as among those slated to be released -- though the
plaintiffs also concede that DOJ has informed the court handling the NFRC case
that the Forest Service is not currently proceeding with these sales.   In
addition, the plaintiffs say that the timber industry in the NFRC case is asking
the court to order the release of the enjoined sales -- in effect, asking    one
court to undo the injunction of another.   So much for why the motion was filed.
If you want to see the motion or have any other questions, let me know.
Are we still on for that call to Janno?
