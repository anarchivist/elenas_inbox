TEXT:
A change should be made to the most recent OMB version of the timber rider.
Dinah and I (along with DOJ lawyers) agreed to this change a while ago; everyone
else approved it; it is purely technical; I've just forgotten to get anyone to
make it.
The change is in (d) (4) -- the replacement, modification etc. provision.
After the term "affected by or released pursuant to this subsection" and before
the term "when the Secretary concerned," the following should be inserted:
         , as initially enacted or as amended,

The copy of the rider that Ron has on his computer seems to be our latest
version (except for this change) -- that is, the version we sent to Hatfield and
his people.  Could all of you folks over there at OMB make sure that this change
is added to that version, so that we have a picture perfect new draft? Many,
many thanks.  Let me know when this is done, and please get me a copy.
