carol -- sorry we haven't hooked up; for a time, i couldn't get through to
you on e-mail; i left a message for you on youe chief of staff's voice
mail, but perhaps you never got it.  I think you're right about the
interagency group:as long as you can do without it for now, i'd rather not
introduce an overlapping group. But it's not a big deal, so if such a
group would help you, you should feel free to start it.  More broadly, I'd
love your advice on the 0-3 conference, which is arousing great excitement
and scarily high expectations.  Talk to you soon.
