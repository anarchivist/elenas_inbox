TEXT,
On Kevin Kirschner's question re the bid bond language:  I've talked to Justice;
Justice has talked to the Forest Service. The conclusion is that we need not
worry about the current bid bond language undermining any of our proposals
(because there indeed were pure 318 sales with returned bid bonds) .
