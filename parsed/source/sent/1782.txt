TEXT:
I was asking something else -- not how much a ceiling of 18 would cost,
but how much a ceiling of 20 would cost (without an average of 18) .

Couple of things.  On the declining match, I don't know if that allievates
Rileys concerns or exacerbates them.  The down side to the approach you
proposed is that it appears to pull the feds out after 5 years, leaving
the locals with half the cost to pick up.  From that perspective, a lower
but continuing federal contribution might be better.  I'm off to meet with
Riley in a few minutes, and will see what I can find out.

Second: you laid out a five year declining match--does that mean you
would prefer a five year initiative rather than a seven year--with
resulting higher costs each year?

Third--as an earlier e-mail indicated, ED is revising its estimate of the
number of teachers we need to hire, in order to get to an 18 kid ceiling
rather than average.  It looks like that will drive the number of new
teachers need to about 89,000, from the 76,000 figure we used yesterday.
Not a terrible increase, but costly nonetheless.  We'll have new cost
estimates soon.

Finally--HAS ANYBODY READ MY DRAFT MEMO FROM THIS MORNING YET?
