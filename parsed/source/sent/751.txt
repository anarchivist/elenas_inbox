TEXT:
A while ago, you showed me a memo you did for the vp's office on new
provisions in the immig law going into effect April 1. Am I remembering
this right? Can you prepare a similar memo from Bruce to the President
and show it to me? Apparently, the President wants to know what's going
on. Many thanks.
