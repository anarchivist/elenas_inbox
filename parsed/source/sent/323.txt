        MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

        SUBJECT:                Federal Policies Targeted to Children in Their Earliest Years



        Over the past few years, scientific research has demonstrated that the earliest years of life --
        before children reach school-age -- are critical to cognitive, emotional, and physical
        development. We know that emotional nourishment, intellectual stimulation, parental and
        community support, good nutrition, proper health care, quality child care, and safe housing
        during the first years of life form the foundation for a chi ld' s ability to learn, thrive in school,
        work productively and contribute fully to society.

        Across the federal government, we are making great strides to enhance development during the
        earliest years of life, before a child reaches school, by investing in research, educating parents
        and caregivers, and supporting programs that provide early intervention to disadvantaged
        families. I am committed to accelerating our efforts to target the earliest years oflife. We all
        have a stake in ensuring that every child is given the opportunity to fulfill his or her God-given
        potential.

        Today, I am directing the heads of executive departments and agencies to report to me in thirty
        days with:

        1.       a comprehensive list and assessment of existing projects and programs that target the
        earliest years of life -- including any qualitative or quanitative evidence of success, as well as
        current funding level and number of clients served -- and a description of proposed
        improvements, if any are needed, to such projects and programs;

        2.       a comprehensive list and assessment of planned projects and programs that target the
        earliest years of life, including projected funding levels and number of clients to be served; and

        3.     specific proposals for additional projects and programs that could be undertaken to
        improve the earliest years of life that do not require new spending, or that can be undertaken this
        year within the proposals in the FY 1998 Budget, or that could be developed for consideration for
        the FY 1999 Budget, within the limits of my Balanced Budget Plan.

        I am also directing the establishment of a senior level interagency working group to share,
        examine, and develop these assessments and plans.
