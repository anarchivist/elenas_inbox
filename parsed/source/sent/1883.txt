fyi ... A concensus seems to be emerging against our compromise, though RS
tells me that Scott Hitt is coming around to it.   Since we're on the hook
to resolve this issue, I think I should have a formal deputies meeting
(right after the SOTU?) -- and then you should follow with a principals
meeting -- to develop and agree upon options to present to the President.

We did comment on the proposed language on needle exchange after
consulting with both Chris Jennings and Kevin Thurm. I will forward a copy
of the memo to you.

I had a lengthy discussion with Kevin last week regarding this issue. HHS
does not plan to do anything on needle exchange until Satcher is
confirmed, assuming that will happen in February. If indeed the
confirmation is held up for some reason,we will have to revisit the timing
of any action.

Contrary to what Scott Hitt may have told you, the AIDS community is still
vehemently opposed to any law enforcement component in any compromise we
might propose. So are General McCaffrey and I. In fact, it may well be the
only point upon which we agree on this issue.

I am meeting again this week with the national AIDS groups to discuss
where we are on needle exchange. I'll keep you posted.

Sandy
