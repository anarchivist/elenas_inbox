life of a woman or avert serious harm to her health. Considerable medical uncertainty surrounds
this question. The doctors ofthe women you met with believed the procedure was necessary for
this reason, and other doctors agree that the procedure, in certain circumstances, is the safest one
to use. Still other doctors dispute that health considerations ever demand use of the procedure.

        Perhaps the most reliable opinion is from the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynceologists (ACOG), which issued a statement in January addressing the procedure, which it
calls intact dilatation and extraction (intact D&X). According to the statement, "A select panel
convened by ACOG could identify no circumstances under which this procedure would be the
only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman." (Emphasis in original.) The
statement then went on: "An intact D&X, however, may be the best or most appropriate
procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and
only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular
circumstances can make this decision.'" In sum, doctors have other options, but those other
options may be more risky or otherwise more undesirable from a medical standpoint.

        Other groups of doctors, with a greater stake in the abortion controversy, have taken more
definitive positions. The Society ofPhysicials for Reproductive Choice and Health issued a
statement last month saying that "in complex obstetrical situations, dilatation and extraction is
the safest procedure to use. It carries the least risk of bleeding, perforation, infection or trauma to
the birth canal." On the other hand, a group of mostly pro-life physicians called PHACT has
written that "there are absolutely no obstetrical situations requiring the destruction of a partially
delivered fetus," and indeed that the procedure involves serious risks of mate mal hemorrhage,
uterine rupture, and infection.

        Given the state of medical evidence on this subject, your longstanding position seems the
appropriate one. That position would leave to doctors themselves the complex decision whether
the procedure is medically necessary in a given set of circumstances. Allowing the medical
community to make clearly medical decisions in this way is the only certain way to protect the
health of women.
