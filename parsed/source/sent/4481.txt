     As the traditional kick-off to the holiday season, you are asked to join
     us for your annual ethics training session. We have put together a
     program that we believe will, once again, both educate and entertain.

     Please remember that, while we try to make ethics training fun, it is
     MANDATORY that you attend one of the sessions listed below in order to
     fulfill your yearly ethics training requirement.  You may select from any
     of the following dates:

                Thursday, December 3, 1998             10:30 am
                Thursday, December 10, 1998            9:30 am
                Tuesday, December 15, 1998             2:30 pm
                Wednesday, December 16, 1998           9:30 am

     All sessions will be held in room 450, OEOB, and will last approximately
     one hour.  A sign language interpreter will be available at each of the
     sessions.  If you have a disability that might require additional aids or
     accommodation, please contact the Counsel's Office at
     456-6229.

     Please arrive on time and be sure to sign in so you receive credi't for
     attendance.
