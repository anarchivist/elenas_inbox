TEXT:
Now I know not to complain.  I'm sure it's a lot worse from the defendant's end
than from a juror's.  I've spent the last three days thinking about whether two
DC police officers wrongfully impounded the plaintiff's hot dog cart.   We too
were deadlocked, but after an instruction from the judge and an hour off for
lunch, we decided the case in short order.   Judgment for the plaintiff, but low
damages.
