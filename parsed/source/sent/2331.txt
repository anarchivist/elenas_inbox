   Subject:         Movement on Biomaterials Bill

   Note: Reply requested by COB Friday, if possible.     House floor action
   possible next Tuesday.

   The House may take up a stand-alone biomaterials bill on the suspension
   calendar next Tuesday or the following Tuesday.  Senator Lieberman's
   office tells me that the Senator hopes to have the Senate take up the
   House version directly, thus avoiding a conference. As a result, Senator
   Lieberman wants to make sure that the Administration is comfortable with
   the version that will be adopted by the House and asked us for any
   comments.

   Before the House Commerce and Judiciary Committees reported out their
   stand-alone biomaterials bill, majority and minority staff, along
   representatives of the Health Industry Manufacturers Association (the
   principal biomaterials bill proponent) and the Association of Trial
   Lawyers of America made significant, technical drafting changes to the
   Senate version.   Senator Lieberman's office has asked us to review those
   changes and let them know whether or not we would object to the bill as
   rewritten.   (Note: The House bill does not include the Baxter amendment.)

   Fran Allegra (DoJ) and I have closely reviewed the rewrite.  The changes
   clearly are motivated by an intent to clarify and improve the drafting of
   the biomaterials provision and almost all are changes to which we are
   indifferent or which we consider technical improvements.

   Two changes are substantive but seem reasonable.  The first would
   authorize the court to stay proceedings while the Secretary of HHS
   considers a petition to declare that the supplier was required to register
   the implant with the Secretary or include it on a list of devices filed
   with the Secretary, and thus can be found liable as a manufacturer
   notwithstanding the protection in the bill. As a practical matter, a
   court would be likely issue such a stay.  This change just provides clear
   authority.  (In addition, at our request on behalf of HHS, the time
   provided for the Secretary to make that declaration has been extended from
   45 to 120 days.)
      The second change limits the liability protection provided by the bill by
      allowing a supplier to be held liable as a seller, not only where the
      supplier acts expressly as a seller, but also where its acts effectively
      as a seller, but by closing in escrow and acting under contract with the
      manufacturer, avoid legal status as a seller. This provision was added by
      House counsel because of fear that biomaterials suppliers, who are also
      sellers, would find creative ways to avoid liability.   HIMA reluctantly ag
      reed to the change.

      There were a few changes that raised new technical drafting issues. We
      provided the Hill staff with a list and they have tentatively agreed to
      all our further edits, subject to final review. We should hear back
      shortly. The staff plan to offer an amendment, including the technical
      changes we requested, as the bill is brought up on the suspension calendar
      next Tuesday or the Tuesday thereafter.

      We have not said that the Administration supports this biomaterials bill,
      although last week we told Senator Lieberman that we would not object if
      biomaterials moved separately, so long as Senator Rockefeller did not
      object.  (He has said that he does not.)   When it comes up on the House
      floor, we will be asked to say officially whether we support this
      biomaterials bill.   I assume that, if all our technical concerns are met,
      the answer is yes (or at least we have no objection), but please let me
      know by close of business Friday your views.

      If you would like to receive a copy of the House bill, please let me know.

      Thank you.
