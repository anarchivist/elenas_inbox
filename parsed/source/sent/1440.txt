Hello:
I just wanted you to know HHS is inthe final stages of the Wolfe letter
reply, and has incorporated a reply for the WH letter.  I have reviewed
and made extensive edits that improve the argument, focusing on the
extraordinary circumstances that justify proceeding with a study with no
treatment as the controlls.  It should be ready Monday.  I will keep you
informed.

Eric
