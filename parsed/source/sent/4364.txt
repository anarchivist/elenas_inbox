It looks like we have a deal on the cancer clinical trials!   Mack's office
just called me and confirmed it following a conversation between Mack and
McCain.  It is the agreement that Josh worked out with me, based on the
conversation I had with Mark Smith this morning. There are a few small
details to be ironed out, but nothing that will allow' this agreement to
blow up.

In short, the $750 million is financed equally between the public health
and the research allocations.  This sharing of the cost was the basic and
necessary tenet that Mack's office insisted on.

I have yet to talk with HHS re this, but Rich Tarplin should be happy
because Josh made sure the percentage allocations devoted to CDC and AHCPR
remain the same.   I personally think this is important so that we have a
relatively decent pot of money we can point to when the advocates of
NIH-directed tobacco research complain we are not supporting the Jeffords
amendment.    (I hear that Koop is really pushing this.)

Lastly, despite the rancor with Mack's office earlier today, you should
know that they are quite pleased with this deal and our efforts to
conclude it. Hopefully this will make the VPOTUS and Erskine happy that
their intervention made a real difference.  Tomorrow, we will make sure
that the cancer community is made aware of the VP's intervention.
