Subject:         Service Memo & Comp Time Legislation

I think there is a small, but very important problem with the memo to
heads of agencies encouraging service.   We should not be explicitly
encouraging flexible credit hours at the same time that we are adamantly
opposing extending an equivalent provision to the private sector.

As you know we are headed toward a legislative battle over comp time and
flexibility.  There is a strong possibility that the Republican bill (S.4)
could come to the floor early next week.  Our position on S.4 has been
that alternative work schedules and the 80 hour biweekly schedule are the
most extreme elements in the bill and that we won't sign a bill that
includes those provisions. To give you an idea how extreme the flexible
credit hours provision is considered, several House Republicans, when
voting on their bill, stated very clearly that their bill does not include
the flexible credit hours provisions and that they would not support
them. The problem with flexible credit hours is that empoyees who work
more than 40 hours/wk do not get paid time and a half for their
"overtime." Flexible credit hours would be money out of employees'
pockets. Under current law, under the Ballenger/House Repub bill and
under our proposal they would get time and a half.
It seems that a few simple changes to the draft memo could fix this
problem. Can we drop the specific references to flexible credit hours and
use general langauge about flexibility instead?

Please let me know.
