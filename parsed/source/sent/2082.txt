Elena,
This morning, the WH group (including NEC, Peter and Maria) met with
Labor, Commerce, INS, etc. to discuss the policy and legislative strategy
reo HIBs. Gene wants to bring this issue up at the NEC principals meeting
this evening (6pm).  Sally would like either you or Bruce to attend.

Ceci and I are putting together a memo that describes: context for this
issue; the Kennedy and Abraham bills; policy options (i.e., (1) do we want
a temporary increase in the cap, plus reforms and training OR do we want
no increase at all; (2) would we oppose an increase (temporary or
permanent) in the cap that does not include reforms and adequate
training); where we think the Hill is; and options for legislative
strategy (including whether and how we should work with Kennedy).  You
will have that in advance of the meeting.  Thanks.

Julie
