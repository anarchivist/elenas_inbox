Subject:         Dredging Event

We are planning an event the morning of next Wednesday, May 7, to announce
some critical pieces of the VP's dredging plan for NY-NJ harbor.   The
event would be with Congressmen Pallone and Menendez and Senator
Torricelli, and is calculated to make sure the Administration (and
especially the VP) gets credit for progress up there rather than Governor
Whitman, who is doing a press event the next day. The VP's plan was
memorialized last year in a letter from Carol Browner, Togo West and
Federica Pena, so we'd like to have Browner, Slater (or Downey) and Togo
West.   Katie and Bruce Reed (DPC worked on the agreement as well) also
may attend.  The VP may do but at this point, given the short notice,
something else would have to come off his schedule (which now seems
unlikely).  Enviro groups, Port companies, and longshoremen would attend
in support as well.
I am contacting the individual cabinet offices to give them notice, but
wanted you to be aware of the plan, and also wanted to enlist your help in
getting the cabinet secretaries there (I understand Slater may be out of
the country, so we may have to make do with Downey) by emphasizing to the
COSs that we want them to do it.
Once again, your good offices are much appreciated.

Elena: Could you give me a sense of whether Bruce has any interest (Diane
put a lot of work into the VPs plan) .
