do you think we should do anything with this? perhaps wait to see what

FYI, assuming you are thinking about whether to add this to our list of
potential events:   one problem that Steve and I talked about is that we
would presurnbly want such an event to stress the welfare angle, but we
don't want critics to say we are relaxing the citizenship process to keep
people on welfare/SSI.   (This isn't true, but they might say it.)  An
alternative message might be that the Administration is doing all it can
within the law to naturalize eligible people with disabilities, and this
will have the happy side effect of helping some of those at risk in the
welfare law, but citizenship only goes so far, as it should -- that we
need the President's proposal to be enacted to really help those in need.
