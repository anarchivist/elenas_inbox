Please try to find chris edley (he should be wandering around washington
somewhere; i take it he has a pager) and figure out a way to get him the
attached memo.  Tell him we'd like to get it into the President today, but
want to know if he has any suggestions.  He should page me THIS MORNING if
he does.  Also tell him I said to thank him for sending me a copy of his
memo, which I very much liked.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

THROUGH:                  ERSKINE BOWLES
                          SYLVIA MATHEWS
                          JUDITH WINSTON

FROM:                     BRUCE REED
                          ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                  RACE INITIATIVE POLICY PROCESS

         This memorandum sets out the process we will use to develop policy announcements and
proposals for the Race Initiative. Our goals are: (1) to help provide a status report on race
relations and racial disparities to inform policy development; (2) to assess and communicate the
impact of this Administration's prior initiatives -- involving economic growth, education, crime,
and so forth -- on race relations and the status of racial minorities; and (3) to build on this
Administration's accomplishments and agenda with new initiatives to announce in the coming
year and longer-term policies to incorporate in the final Presidential Report. We have a strong
base from which to work, and we will attempt to ensure that the policy measures accompanying
the Race Initiative will grow out of everything this Administration has done already.
Throughout, we will focus on solutions that reflect the common values of the American people
(~, equal opportunity and shared responsibility), and respond to their common aspirations (~,
safe streets, good schools, and affordable housing).

Research and Investigation

        In close cooperation with the DPC, NEC, Judy Winston, and Chris Edley, CEA will
coordinate research on the current state ofrace relations and the continuing disparities in critical
measures of well-being among individuals of different races. CEA already has developed a draft
outline for this research, based on conversations with DPC and Chris Edley. The outline, which
is attached to this memo, suggests research on, among other things: (1) disparities in economic
success, educational opportunity, health care, political participation, family organization, and
criminal victimization; (2) racial segregation in schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces; and (3)
the prevalence and consequences ofracial discrimination. In addition, research will be done on
the differential effects of particular kinds of public policy on racial groups. CEA will do some
aspects of this research itself and will assign other aspects to the appropriate offices in Treasury,
DOL, Education, HHS, and DOl This work will go into the final President's Report and will
influence and inform the development of policy discussed below.

Interagency Policy Development Process

        The DPC has established four major workgroups to develop policy for the Race Initiative.
 Bruce Reed, Elena Kagan, and Jose Cerda will coordinate the efforts of these groups. We
anticipate developing both administrative actions and legislative proposals, and combining
incrementa! (but important) policy advances with a few truly bold ideas. We will advance some
of the policy proposals during the year-long initiative, while saving others for the President's
Report at the end. The workgroups also will have responsibility for assessing the impact of prior
Administration initiatives in their policy areas, so that we can build on our own
accomplishments. In coordinating policy development through these workgroups, we of course
will work closely with Judy Winston and Chris Edley, and we will incorporate, as appropriate,
advice provided to you by the Chair and Members of the Advisory Board.

1.     Economic and Community Empowerment (co-chaired by Bruce Reed and Gene
       Sperling). This group will look at issues and policies relating to (1) job opportunities for
       unemployed and underemployed minorities, including welfare-to-work efforts and
       transportation initiatives to move inner city residents to suburban jobs; (2) housing for
       low-income residents of inner cities, including new or expanded uses of voucher plans
       and tax incentives to promote mixed-income, multi-racial communities; (3) metropolitan
       regional strategies to strengthen links between inner cities and suburbs; and (4) minority
       entrepreneurship, including credit programs building on CRA and CDFI.

       Participating White House offices are: DPC, NEC, OYP/CEB, OPL, Intergovernmental,
       Legislative, CEA, CEQ, OMB.
       Participating agencies are: Treasury, Labor, Commerce, Transportation, HUD, SBA, and
       Interior (for Native American population).

2.     Education (chaired by Mike Cohen). This group will look at issues and policies relating
       to (1) failing inner city and rural schools, including issues of racial segregation and
       enhanced efforts to niise standards, improve teaching, provide improved infrastructure
       and new technology, promote charter schools, and encourage school takeovers and other
       accountability mechanisms; (2) education of Hispanic students, including bilingualism;
       and (3) expanded access to higher education and skills training. (Note that responses to
       Proposition 209 and Hopwood fall within the Administration of Justice Workgroup.)

       Participating White House offices are: DPC, NEC, OYP, OPL, Intergovernmental,
       Legislative, OMB.
       Participating agencies are: Education, Interior.

3.    . Administration of Justice (chaired by Elena Kagan). This group will look at issues and
        policies relating to (1) criminal law enforcement and prevention, including the
        underprotection of minority communities (including Indian reservations), police force
        composition and practices (including diversity issues and community policing), and after-



                                                       Automated Records Management System

       school and other youth programs; and (2) enforcement of civil rights laws, including
       responses to Proposition 209 and Hopwood, reduction of the EEOC complaint backlog
       and other EEOC reforms, enhanced efforts on housing and lending discrimination,
       affirmative action issues generally, and hate crimes initiatives (for November
       conference).

        policies relating to (1) special health care needs of minority populations, including the
        high incidence of certain health conditions and diseases and the underutilization of certain
        health care services, such as immunizations and mammograms; and (2) family
        composition, including efforts to strengthen two-parent families, ensure adoption of
        minority children, and provide supports to families led by grandparents.

       OMB.
       Participating agencies are: HHS, Interior.

First Policy Announcement

        As you know, you will be attending the NAACP convention in Chicago on Thursday.
We believe this speech offers an excellent opportunity to discuss the intersection of race and
education issues. First, your speech can address the value of integration in educational settings.
Thurgood Marshall once wrote that "unless our children begin to learn together, there is little
hope that our people will ever learn to live together"; your speech can make exactly this link
between educational integration and race relations generally to members of the organization most
closely identified with progress in this area. This message would echo the strong argument you
made for diversity in education in your San Diego speech; it also would lead naturally into your
commemoration of the integration of Little Rock Central High School in September. Minyon
Moore and others are reaching out to Kweisi Mfume and others to ensure that we address this
issue in a way that avoids exacerbating internal NAACP divisions on the subject.

       Second and no less important, you can stress the need to improve right now
predominantly poor and minority schools in inner city and rural areas. This part of your speech
can protest the neglect (financial and otherwise) of predominantly minority schools and the
consignment of their students to a second-class education. Here, you should make a strong
statement about the importance of national standards and tests to boost expectations and improve
the quality of education. But you should make an equally strong statement about providing
students with the tools and opportunities to help them meet those standards -- better teaching,



                                                      Automated Records Management System
                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion

improved infrastructure and new technologies, and mechanisms to take over failing schools,
including by turning them into charters (Rosa Parks is now trying to establish a charter school in
Detroit).

         As a down payment on a broader effort to improve inner city and rural schools, you can
announce a new proposal to improve teaching in these institutions. The quality of teaching in
inner city and rural schools is much lower than in the rest of the nation; in particular, the teachers
in these schools are far less well trained than in others. To address this situation, Title V ofthe
Department of Education's proposed reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which will be
submitted to Congress later this summer, proposes a new initiative to recruit, prepare, and retain
teachers in urban and poor rural communities. This program would provide at least $325 million
over five years (we are still working out the exact funding with OMB) for two purposes: (1) to
strengthen teacher training programs that operate in partnership with -- and place large numbers
of graduates in -- urban or poor rural schools; and (2) to provide scholarships to talented and
diverse individuals, chosen jointly by institutions of higher education and eligible school
districts, who will commit to teach in urban and poor rural areas for at least three years after
graduation.
