TEXT:
Bruce -- I'm giving this to you without a last paragraph or two -- sorry.
It seems to me that we need to do a bit more in the way of pros and cons.
On the pro side -- will make us look proactive and will set up
congres~ional debate next year (even assuming we can't reach a ggod
agreement). On the con side: Dems may think that we'll sell them out and
be angry with us.  I think the recommendation should be to make sure it's
OK with them (convince them that it will be a tough negotiating team etc.)
and then go ahead and do it .. Again, sorry I'm leaving you with this, and
much else.  I'll call you tomorrow,
