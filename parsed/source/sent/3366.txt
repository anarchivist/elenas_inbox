TEXT:

I believe that Steve Neuwirth used to do alot of the FACA issues.
Who should I refer these issues to now?
Also, NPR may be interested in doing an EO to formally create a
commission.   (I say formally because there may be a group that
has been working the issue already.)    I used to do alot of EO
work in the earlier days of the Administration, but I would prefer
to have Counsel's office run with this. Who would that be?
Thanks much.
