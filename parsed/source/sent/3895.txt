TEXT:
Makes sense.  Laura: could you get a copy from Julie Mason of the latest
complete set of q&a for the President's press conference and copy it for
everyone so that they know what they're making changes, additions, and
subtractions off of.  (Let everyone know that that's why you're
circulating it.)

Here's an idea--when we submit q&as to you through Laura and you edit them
or not before sending them in, could we get a copy of what actually goes
in so we can start with the revised copy next time?
