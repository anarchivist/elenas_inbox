TEXT:
I didn't say anything on the call home approach, but I do agree with Dinah (and
now Martha) on that.
And I think Martha raises a really good question about who and what this memo is
for. As it's written, it doesn't seem to DO much of anything.   I know I'd have
a better sense of what should be in it (e.g., discussion of priorities or of
contract cancellation) if I knew what it was supposed to accomplish.
