Question:   Will you sign the Partial Birth Abortion Act now that it has passed both the House
            and Senate with overwhelming majorities?

Answe'r:    No, because I am still not convinced that this bill adequately protects women from
            grievous harm. I have said over and over that if Congress were to add a narrow
            exception covering the few cases where this procedure is needed to prevent
            women in dire circumstances from suffering serious injury, then I would gladly
            sign the bill. But until Congress does add that narrow exception, I will veto the
            bill -- no matter how many votes there are in favor it -- to protect the health of
            women.


Question:   Why didn't the AMA's endorsement of the Partial Birth Abortion Act -- and its
            statement that the partial-birth procedure is not good medicine -- change your
            view ofthis legislation?

Answer:     I looked at the AMA's letter, and it did not persuade me that this bill fully protects
            women from grievous injury. Let me remind you that the American College of
            Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which is the organization of doctors that knows
            the most about this issue, opposes this bill for the same reason I do -- because it
            prevents doctors from using a procedure that in a small group of cases best
            protects women from serious physical injury. The AMA endorsed this bill after
            bargaining for a change that protects doctors. I've implored Congress to make a
            narrow change in the bill to protect women -- to ensure that they don't suffer
            grievous injury because Congress has tied the hands of their doctors -- and I will
            not sign the bill until I get it.


Question:    Didn't you base your prior veto ofthe bill on false information -- i.e., that this
            procedure is performed only a few hundred times each year and only when women
            are in great danger?

Answer:     I vetoed the bill because there are a small group of women in desperate
            circumstances who need this procedure in order to save their lives or prevent
            serious injury to their health. Let's be clear: I've never said that these are the only
            circumstances in which the procedure is used; I've just said that these few women
            need to be protected. If Congress does so, I will gladly sign the bill, because I
            think this kind of procedure should be banned except when necessary to save the
            life of a woman or prevent serious harm to her health.
