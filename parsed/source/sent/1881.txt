TEXT:
Jonathan Chait is doing an article for TNR on Clinton's new domestic
policy agenda.  Beverly Barnes gave him my name, but I felt a bit
uncomfortable talking with him before you did.  So I gave him your name,
encouraged him to call, and said I'd be delighted to talk to him after.
(Maybe a bit wierd, but I wanted to talk to you first.)  He said he'd do
the interview on whatever terms you want -- he said quotes aren't
particularly important to him.  He made it sound as if the article will be
very positive (but of course they all do, don't they) -- new spurt of
energy, active domestic policy, setting the agenda, encounterinh little
resistance etc.  He said what he really wanted to know was WHY this was
happening (and why now) after a period of relative dormancy (is that a
word?)
