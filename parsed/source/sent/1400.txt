Subject:         Lee/Affirmative Action

The WHO/DOJ Lee confirmation team meets with outside groups every
wednesday here at the White House. At tomorrow's meeting we will be
joined by Senate staff who are interested in this nomination and wanted to
meet with the groups.  These staff folks also work affirmative action
issues and Kennedy's people want to talk about what is happening on the
Hill. So we're going to first discuss the Lee nomination and then let
Senate folks turn to the broader question.   The meeting is at 11am in
room 180. My plan was to do more listening than anything else but let me
know if you have other thoughts on it.
