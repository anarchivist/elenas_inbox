TEXT:
On the Alaska timber issue: The issue is whether to file a brief (due tomorrow)
supporting timber cutting in the Tongass pending completion of an environmental
impact statement.   Katie, Dinah Bear (Counsel for CEQ), Jim Lyons
 (Undersecretary for Natural Resources at DOA) and I all agree that we should not
file the brief because it undercuts our position in Congress with respect to the
so-called Tongass rider on the just-vetoed Interior Appropriations bill.   We all
think we should ask for an extension of time and try to use our litigation
position in the case as a card to play in. bargaining with Congress over the
rider.  Given the apparent unanimity on this question, I do not think there is
any way we will file the brief tomorrow.   Right now people seem to be arguing
over how much additional time to ask for, not whether to ask for it at all.    I
will let' you know how this all comes out.
On the grazing and Coast Guard issues, there's nothing yet to report (neither I
nor CEQ even knows what the isssues are yet).   These have been put on the
baCK-burner while the Alaska timber business is figured out. Again, I'll let
you know.
