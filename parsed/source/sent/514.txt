MEMORANDUM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT

FROM:                           BRUCE REED
                                ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                        LABOR ISSUES IN WELFARE REFORM

        You may be asked at the AFL-CIO meeting about two welfare refonn implementation
issues of importance to the labor movement. This memorandum provides you with some
background on these issues, which the Administration is now in the process of resolving. Two
q&a, which reflect a consensus view on how to address these issues, are attached to this memo.
We recommend that you not discuss these issues unless asked to do so.

1. Application of worker protection laws to working welfare recipients

        As the work requirements of the new welfare law begin to go into effect, a critical
question for both the labor movement and the states is whether worker protection laws --
particularly the minimum wage law (Fair Labor Standards Act) -- protect welfare recipients who
take part in workfare or subsidized employment programs. The DPC and OMB have been
running an interagency process (involving DOL, HHS, USDA, and others) to hammer out an
answer to this question. We expect to have a detailed recommendation for the President within
the next few weeks, as well as a strategy for rolling out this controversial Administration policy.

        There is general agreement among the agencies, as a matter of both law and policy, that
the Fair Labor Standards Act should be read to require payment of at least the minimum wage to
most people in workfare and wage supplementation programs. On this reading, participants in
such programs would count as "employees" under the Act, thus qualifying for minimum wage
protection -- except for a few who would count as "trainees" instead. Bruce has given the AFL
private assurances that the Administration will adopt this basic position.

        Requiring the minimum wage for workfare recipients, however, will raise obvious
difficulties for the states, in light of the new welfare law's work provisions. Even if a recipient is
working only 20 hours each week, the existing welfare grant in many states will fall short of a
minimum wage salary. As the work requirement in the law increases to 25 and then to 30 hours,
and as the minimum wage also increases, more and more states will discover that their welfare
grants are insufficient.

        One way to mitigate this new burden on the states is to count benefits other than cash
assistance toward the minimum wage. There is a very strong legal argument, based on


                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                           2

    provisions in the food stamp law, that states may add the value of food stamps to the basic
    welfare grant for purposes of complying with the minimum wage. Even ifboth these streams of
    benefits are counted, however, a number of Southern states will immediately come up short, and
    as the minimum wage increases and the work requirements become more severe, other states will
    join them over time. Allowing states to count the value of other benefits -- child care, housing,
    or transportation -- toward the minimum wage would remove this problem, but this proposal
    raises a number of legal and policy questions. DPC and OMB are currently working through
    these and similar issues with the affected agencies in an effort to apply the minimum wage law to
    working welfare recipients withoutimposing large new costs on states.

             The interagency group also is reviewing what other labor protections apply to welfare
    recipients in workfare or subsidized employment programs. The consensus view is that OSHA,
    unemployment insurance, and anti-discrimination laws will apply in the same way they do for
    other workers. We have yet to get a firm opinion from Treasury as to whether the monies paid to
    these welfare recipients will be subject to FICA and other taxes, as well as eligible for the EITC,
    but we believe they will not. Finally, these workers may well become eligible to unionize.
    Recent newspaper articles have suggested that some unions will undertake large-scale organizing
    efforts targeting welfare recipients, and we probably should expect some of these efforts to
    succeed.

            Recommendation: As the President has agreed, you should not raise the minimum wage
    issue at the AFL meeting. Announcing a position favorable to the unions in this context would
    make the decision look entirely political and increase the risk of a negative reaction from the
    governors and Congress. When asked about the issue, you should make a strong statement of
    principle that workers shouldn't be paid a subminimum wage, whether or not they come off the
    welfare rolls. But you should also be careful to note that the Administration is still in the process
    of developing its final positions on the complex issues arising from the intersection of the labor
    laws and the new welfare law.

    2. Privatization of welfare functions

            Another issue that may arise at the AFL meeting concerns efforts by some states to
    privatize their welfare operations. Texas has had a waiver request pending at HHS and USDA
    for months that would allow it to contract with private parties to do all eligibility determinations
    for food stamps and Medicaid. (The new welfare law specifically grants states the right to
    privatize TANF operations.) Wisconsin has a more limited waiver request pending. We
    probably have legal authority to grant such waivers.

            This issue is of obvious importance for unions with large numbers of public sector
    employees, because a waiver means a loss of jobs for their members. As of now, however, the
    unions are not pressing us for a decision, perhaps because they expect us to allow at least some
    privatization. We have been getting pressure from Governors Bush and Thompson, but the
    interagency group is still not ready to make a recommendation.


                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion
