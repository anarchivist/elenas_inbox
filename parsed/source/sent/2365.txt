TEXT:
actually, if the fallback is necessary, I'd say:  "A racially neutral
criterion . . . is permissible, but only so long as there is ... " That
way, you at least get the broad statement of admissibility standing by
itself (before the comma), separate from the qualfiying phrase.   Not much
of a difference, but perhaps worthwhile.
