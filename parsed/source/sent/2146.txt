MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bruce Reed
               Elena Kagan

RE:            DPC Weekly Report


         Crime -- School Safety: The Department of Education is preparing to release a report on
the impact'ofthe Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) during the 1996-97 school year. As you know,
the GFSA generally requires all states receiving fun,ds under the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act to expel students who bring a firearm to school for a period of at least one year.
The report found that 7,326 students were expelled during the 1996-97 school year for bringing a
firearm to school, an increase of about 10%. Colorado reported the highest number (1,873) and
rate (2.573 per 1,000 students) of expulsions. Other high-expulsion states include: by overall
number, Ohio (937), California (723), Texas (532), Missouri (318) and Illinois (250); and by
rate, Ohio (.449 per 1,000), Missouri (.310 per 1,000) and New Mexico (.195 per 1,000). DC,
?awaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and, Wyoming reported no expUlsions. The lowest rates were
reported by North Dakota (.008 per 1,000), Minnesota (.019 per 1,000), Mississippi (.020 per
1,000) and New Jersey (.028).

        Of the 3,246 expulsions where the type of firearms was identified, 58% involved
handguns, 7% involved rifles and the remaining 35% involved some other type of firearms
(bombs, grenades, starter pistols, rockets). The report also found that High Schools students
were the most likely to carry a firearm: Of the 5,352 expulsions where the student's school level
was reported, 57% were in high school, 35% were in junior high and 8% were in elementary
school.

        Crime -- Missing Children: On Thursday, the Justice Department launched a missing
and exploited children web site. The site tells kids where to go if they are lost or need help, and
provides tips on how to they can avoid being exploited on the Internet. The site provides
information to parents on how to best protect their children, and steps they can take if their child
is missing. In addition, the site includes information on available law enforcement training for
investigating child kidnaping and abduction cases, and links to missing children web sites in
other countries.

       Drunk Driving -- .08 BAC Report: Next week, the Transportation Department will
transmit a report prepared in response to your March 3 directive to promote the adoption of .08
BAC as the legal limit for impaired driving. The Transportation report recommends that the



                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
the legal limit to .08 BAC on military installations, national parks, and waterways. It also reports
that Defense will transmit legislation to Congress to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice
to provide for the punishments for violating a .08 limit on military bases.

       Tobacco --Senate Strategy: In order to take advantage of the momentum created by
the vote in the Commerce Committee two weeks ago, Erskine, Larry and I plan to meet
with key Senators when they return to town next week. We will meet first with Senator
Daschle and then, separately, with Senator McCain, to discuss how to negotiate
improvements to the McCain bill, hopefully before it goes to the floor, and to devise an
amendment strategy. We will also meet individually with Senators Breaux, Conrad,
Durbin, Lautenberg, and Kennedy, to address their concerns and enlist their help in
advancing the key improvements we seek in the bill. \Ve will strcss to all our commitment
to enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation this year, and will try to impress upon them
that we should be reasonable in our demands,. lest the entire legislative effort should fall
apart. We also plan to meet with key public health leaders --we met with Dr. Koop on
Thursday, and plan to meet soon with Dr. Kessler, and with members of the coalition of
public health groups working hardest to enact legislation (American Cancer Society,
American Heart Association, and Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids).


        Education -- Mayor Daley's Proposed Tax Breaks for After School Programs:
During your recent trip to Chicago Mayor Daley raised with you his idea of tax-credits for
after school programs. Presently, after school programs in the Chicago public schools
(which are an essential part of the city's efforts to end social promotions) are financed
solely with public funds. There are no fees charged to parents, and no tax breaks of any
kind. Last year the Mayor asked his staff to explore whether some form of tax credits to
help parents cover the cost of after-school programs could be developed as a reasonable
middle-ground position in the debate over vouchers and tax savings for private school
tuition. However, his staff have been unable to develop a workable proposal since Chicago
parents are not charged fees for participating in the programs. While the Mayor remains
interested in this idea, there are no plans for proceeding with it locally.

        We believe the Mayor's idea to incorporate tax savings for after school programs
into the Coverdell proposal raises several concerns: first, it could undermine your $200
million appropriations request for after-school programs; second, it would undercut our
strategy for defeating Coverdell, which has been to urge Democrats to resist adding
amendments that would make the bill more attractive in light of an expected veto; finally,
since Senators Lott and Daschle have already agreed to a specific set of floor amendments,
it would be difficult to gain Democratic support for reopening those negotiations on behalf
of Mayor Daley's proposal.

working closely with the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and our
allies in Congress to ensure that Representative Goodling's provision to end federal
funding for the Board is stripped from the Higher Education Act before Congress
completes action on that bill. The bill reported by the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee contains no such provision, and we believe there is little chance that a similar
provision will be added on the Senate floor. The House is likely to take up the Higher.
Education Act in late April or early May; where it is expected to pass by a wide margin.
The National Board has urged that you hold off on a veto threat until the bill goes to
conference. We lack the votes to defeat Goodling on the floor, and the Board does not want
to precipitate a recorded vote against it in the House. However, we believe that you should
use the April 24 National Teacher of the Year Event to express your deep concern over this
provision and pledge to work with Congress to remove it before the bill crosses your desk.

        Community Empowerment -- Fair Lending: The Federal Reserve Bank has issued an
advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that asks for comment on whether Regulation B (which
carries out the provisions of the ECOA) should be amended to permit lenders voluntarily to
collect infonnation about the race and gender of applicants for non-mortgage credit. The
prohibition on collection of this data inhibits monitoring by regulators, self-testing by the
financial services industry, and enforcement by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade
Commission, with respect to discrimination in the non-mortgage lending markets. Amending
this prohibition is one ofthe top priorities for community groups. We are working closely with
Treasury, Justice, and the NEC on drafting a letter by May 29 in support of a rulemaking.

        Health Care -- Kennedy Employer Mandate Legislation: Next Wednesday, Senator
Kennedy is scheduled to introduce a health care employer mandate bill. This bill, which
has the strong support of the labor community, would require that all firms with 50 or
more employees provide coverage that is equivalent to the Federal Employees Health
Benefit Blue Cross/Blue Shield standard plan. Employers would be required to contribute
approximately 75 percent of the cost of coverage with the remainder coming from the
employee. While this legislation will not go anywhere in this Congress, Senator Kennedy
would like to force a Senate vote on this bill sometime this year. 'Although any employer
mandate would significantly expand coverage, this legislation would not affect the over 20
million. uninsured Americans who have workers in firms with less than fifty employees and
could have the adverse effect of encouraging firms to split or subcontract out in order to
avoid the mandate. Moreover, the absence of subsidies may make it difficult for some
employees to afford the premiums, even though employers would have to contribute 75
percent. Senator Kennedy's office had initially requested that the First Lady or some
representative from the Administration consider attending this event, but now is now
willing instead to accept a genenilly positive statement from the White House. We
recommend such a statement commend Senator Kennedy for his longstanding commitment
to coverage expansion without giving an all-out endorsement. Implicit in our comments will

enacted by a Republican Congress.

       Welfare Reform --New York Results: Last month you asked whether we had any
explanation for the recent report that only 29 percent of the cases who left the rolls in New
York State in March of 1997 were working in the next quarter, compared to rates of 50 to
60 percent in other states. (other leave due to marriage, their youngest child turning 18, an
increase in child support, receipt of SSI, increase in earnings by another family member, or
 sanctions).

        Our review uncovered several problems with these data, which were gathered from
the state's wage reporting system. First, the data were incomplete --not all employers had
reported for this quarter at the time the data were compiled. Looking at data from March
of 1996 -- which found 39 percent showed earnings in at least one of the three quarters
after leaving welfare -- produces figures that are somewhat closer to the experience in other
states. In general, there appear to be lags in reporting new employees and employer
reporting may also be worse in New York because the state's wage reporting system is not
directly linked to the unemployment insurance system the way it is in most places.

       This system also undercounts employment, though we do not know by how much. It
ignores some self-employment, "off the books" wages, and work in other states. The
statewide figure also masks variation within the state: for cases closed in March 1996, 31
percent had wages reported in a subsequent quarter in'New York City, compared to 47
percent in the rest of the state. Apparently NYC historically has a high level of
"administrative churning", i.e. cases closed due to various errors then reopened, which we
wouldn't expect to have earnings in a later quarter.

        Immigration -- RIB visas: Representative Lamar Smith, Chair of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Immigration, has made an offer to Representative Mel Watt (ranking member)
to develop a bipartisan bill to temporarily raise the cap on HIB visas for highly skilled temporary
foreign workers that, unlike the Abraham-Hatch bill in the Senate, iricludes reforms to the HlB
program that target their use to employers that are experiencing genuine skill shortages, We are
having discussions with members of Congress to develop reform language that is consistent with
the Administration's objectives, Representative Smith is holding a hearing on this issue on
Tuesday, April 21 st.

        Child Care -- Rose Garden Event: We are planning Rose Garden event on Thursday,
April 23 with you and the First Lady to place pressure on Congress to take action on your child
care, That day, Secretary Rubin's Working Group on Child Care will issue a final report on
private sector investment in child care and best practices, In addition, the Department of Labor
will issue its report on child care, focusing on corporate models gleaned from the Women's
Bureau's Honor Roll.
