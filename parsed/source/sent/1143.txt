TEXT:
Have you read the Shalala memo on state use of "excess" TANF funds?   I
think it's pretty interesting.   I was thinking that we should send it in
with a cover note advising the President to do a major address to a state
legislature on this issue -- what states should do to make welfare reform
work, what they shouldn't do, etc.   I think it would get quite a lot of
attention -- and I think it's something we should be doing to encorage
states, to the' extent we can, to adopt appropriate policies.  What do'you
think?
