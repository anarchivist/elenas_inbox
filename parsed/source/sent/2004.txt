Subject: Jeffords tobacco bill

Senators Collins and Enzi cosponsored the Jeffords bill. You can call up
the text of the Jeffords and Conrad bills at Congress's web site:
http://thomas.loc.gov   The Jeffords bill is S. 1648; Conrad is S. 1638.
You can find the bill text by starting at the Thomas home page, and
clicking under "Bills" either "Bill Summary and Status" or "Bill Text"
for the 105th Congress.  From there it is self explanatory.  Happy hunting.
