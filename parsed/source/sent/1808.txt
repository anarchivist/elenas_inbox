Bob Barr, in today's Freeh hearing, suggested that it was a security
threat to permit welfare hires to work at the White House.  Apparently,
Dems went after him pretty good.  I've told Reuters that people hired here
undergo the same rigorous clearance process and drug testing regardless of
circumstances, and to suggest that single mothers trying to raise their
children and make the transition from welfare to work are inherently a
greater security threat is offensive.  (We need Mr. Barr on stage in the
next race town hall.)
