Excellent first e-mail.     You're a natural.

I'm happy to meet with you Friday.   Ask Cathy to set it up. Down the
road, we should have those mtgs. earlier, so that we can put new ideas
into the weekly which is due Friday.

                P61(b)(6)              Thanks for being so understanding.

You're doing a great job.
