Here's what happened, far as I can tell.  Cynthia e-mailed me the correct
version; I forwarded it to our typing folks; typing somehow printed out
the old version and handed it off to me in the hallway; I ran it up to the
Oval and missed the mistake; Bruce and Rahm walked it in the Oval; Bruce
brought it back down unsigned, saying the President had approved it; we
signed it and faxed it to Elena; apparently, Elena caught the problem and
told Bruce; he and I sat down and put a correct version together and faxed
it off again; we then created new, signed originals and a press stencil
and got everything out the door.

Bottom line is - - I take responsibility for the screw up; I'm the guy
whose job it is to catch stuff like this and I didn't.  Fortunately, DPC
prevented what could have been a much more serious error.
