This is wacky! Keith, pardon my ignorance of pre-8/96 history, but under
what circumstances was the 96 draft put together? Did it get a lot of
scrutiny and debate, or did we just throw it together? And why the big
shift from 94 position?

Jeff Farkas found basically that our '94 bill kept worker protections for
workfare protections while our '96 bill did not (see below).  This will
make our roll-out even more tricky.

Subject: FLSA in 94 and 96 Administration WR Bills

Here is some information on the FLSA-related provisions of the
Administration's 1994 and 1996 welfare bills (in the sections related to
cash assistance work programs).  Please let me know if you have any
questions.

The WORK program in the 1994 bill incorporated a comprehensive set of
workfare protections, including minimum wage (FLSA), workers compensation,
working conditions, and FICA taxation. The bill did not provide
unemployment compensation coverage (at the Federal or State level), and
did not allow the EITC for earnings from WORK positions.

The 1996 bill is much less specific than the 1994 bill. It would extend
FLSA coverage for work supplementation programs (the language is nearly
identical to the work supp provisions in the JOBS statute, where FLSA
applied), but not for workfare positions.     Under workfare, participants
in community service jobs were required to work a designated number of
hours (reaching 30 per week in the out years) and to be paid at a rate
which is "100 percent of the maximum amQunt of assistance that may be
provided under the State plan ... to a family of the same size and
composition with no income."   In many instances this level would be
sub-minimum wage.  In addition, the bill provided that "wages paid under a
workfare program shall not be considered to be earned income for puposes
of any provision of law." This would seem to preclude application of FLSA.
