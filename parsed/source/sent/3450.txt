TEXT:
DOJ is supposed to get me a memo today.  Of course, it was supposed to be ththen
friday, etc.
meantime, dodd's person on the issue called john angell who referred him to me.
he had heard rumors that we were thinking of doing this and wanted to get some
indication of where we were.  (i basically told him we were nowhere.)  i think
he thinks we're nuts -- first we veto the secutiry bill, then we take on an
issue that will make the nader-types angrier than anything that was in that
bill. he said that in earlier discussions dodd had decided to stay away from it
with a 10-foot pole.
