'1 also ask this Congress to support our efforts to enlist colleges and universities to reach out to disadvantaged children
starting in the sinh grade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they, too, will be
able to go on to college.fI


                                                                 --President Clinton, State of the Union address, January 27,
1998

The Higher Education Amendments of1998 launch GEAR UP, a new national effort to encourage more young
people to have high expectations, stay in school and study hard, and go to college.
·      High-achieving students from low-income families are five times less likely to attend college than high-
       achieving students from high-income families [NELS 1998].
·      In a recent survey, almost 70 of parents indicated that they have little information or want more
       information about which courses their child should take to prepare for college, and 89 of parents want
       more information about how to pay for college, including the use of tax credits [Gallup, Sept. 1998].
The President's High Hopes Proposal. Earlier this year, President Clinton proposed the High Hopes for
College initiative to create a national ethic that every college should partner with at least one middle school in
a low-income community to help raise expectations and ensure that students are well-prepared for college. In
the new HEA law, the High Hopes proposal and the National Early Intervention Scholarship and
Partnership (NEISP) program are joined, as two different types of grants, under the new GEAR UP
program.
GEAR UP (Gaining Earlv Awareness and Readiness fOr Undergraduate Programs J. This new competitive grant
program, authorized at $200 million in FY99, supports early intervention and college awareness activities at
both the local and the state level. The Senate's FY99 Appropriations bill allocates to GEAR UP $75 million
of the $140 million the President requested for High Hopes. The House Appropriations bill did not include
funding for GEAR UP. The final appropriations legislation is now pending in Congress. GEAR UP
funding will be split between Partnership grants and State grants, with at least one-third allocated to each.
GEAR UP Partnership grants. As outlined in the President's High Hopes for College proposal, this initiative
will award multi-year grants to locally-designed partnerships between colleges and high-poverty middle
schools, plus at least two other partners such as community organizations, businesses, religious groups, state
education agencies, parent groups, or non-profits, to increase college-going rates among low-income youth.
To be most effective, partnerships will be based on the following proven strategies:
·      Informing students and parents about college options and financial aid, and every student will receive a 21'1
       Century Scholar Certificate -- an early notification of their eligibility for financial aid;
·      Promoting rigorous academic coursework based on college entrance requirements;
·      Working with a whole grade-level of students in order to raise expectations for all students; and
·      Starting early, with 6"' or 7' grade students, and continuing through high school graduation with
       comprehensive services including mentoring, tutoring, counseling, and other activities
       such as after school programs, summer academic and enrichment programs, and college visits.
GEAR UP State grants. These grants are based on the current National Early Intervention Scholarship and
Partnership (NEISP) program and will be awarded to states to provide scholarships, college information and
early intervention activities. State programs will target services to low-income students and will provide
college' scholarships for participating students. College and community partnerships are not required but are
encouraged, and many NEISP programs involve local organizations. Nine states received NEISP grants in
FY98, totaling $3.6 million. These NEISP programs provide a variety of early intervention services and
                                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion

We anticipate that GEAR UP grant applications will be available in the beginning of next year. You can
send questions or request more information bye-mailing gearup@ed.gov.
                EXAMPLES OF MENTORING AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS


Many states education agencies, colleges, and secondary schools have had success working together to
increase college enrollment rates among low-income students. To this end, the new GEAR UP program will
support early intervention initiatives with elements of the successful practices described below.

       Early Identification Program (Fairfax, Virginia): George Mason University (GMU) and the Fairfax
       County Public Schools developed the Early Identification Program (EIP) in 1987 to increase the
       number of minority students who enter college. Since then, additional school districts and new
       partners have joined the effort, including Booz Allen and Hamilton, Mobil Corporation, NationsBank
       and Crestar Bank. The program works with minority students that demonstrate academic potential
       and provides year-round tutoring, mentoring and other support throughout high school, including
       weekend and summer academic programs, special projects in math, science, English and computer
       science, campus visits, and workshops for parents. The program reports that they have graduated 6
       classes from high school, and have a 71 percent retention rate. Of those who completed 4 years in
       EIP, 95 percent go on to college.

       Pace Hispanic Outreach Program (White Plains, NY): The program is a unique tutorial initiative for
       Hispanic immigrant students at the White Plains High School that is run through a collaborative
       effort involving the White Plains School District, Pace University and Centro Hispano. One-to-one
       tutorial sessions are held during study hall periods and are designed to complement and reinforce
       classroom instruction in English, mathematics and social studies. In addition, the program enlists
       high school counselors to provide weekly clinics to help high school seniors prepare college
       applications, financial aid forms and essays. Active community support and parental involvement has
       helped build confidence among participants by reducing the sense of powerlessness that language
       barriers cause in some Hispanic families.

       Passport to ColJege (Riverside, California): At the core of this effort is a partnership between Riverside
       Community College in California, the local school district, and a number of schools and local
       businesses, and its purpose is to encourage disadvantaged students to continue on to college. The
       program works with and entire grade of students, beginning in 5th grade, and follows them through
       high school graduation. Currently, 11,500 students are participating. Volunteers work with the
       students, teachers and parents in activities, including: campus tours, classroom presentations, teacher
       training workshops, parent meetings, and financial aid workshops. All participating students who
       graduate from high school are guaranteed admission to Riverside Community College.

       Project GRAD (Houston, Texas): Project GRAD (Graduation Really Achieves Dreams) is a school-
      community collaboration to improve the instructional quality and school environment for children in
      Houston's inner city schools. This effort combines research-based curricular reform in math, reading
      and language arts with comprehensive services, including tutoring, mentoring and counseling, for
      children starting in Kindergarten through high schoo!. The project works with whole networks of
      schools -- elementary through high school -- to develop a consistent emphasis on high standards for
                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
if they reach basic academic standards. Currently, 24 schools in Houston and over 17,000 students
are involved with Project GRAD. This massive effort is supported by a partnership of school,
corporate, and community-based organizations and foundations.




                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
                              BY LOWERING STUDENT LOAN INTEREST RATES
                      Wefl into this Year, Many Doubted That Student Loan Interest Rates WouJdDrop
 "This summer, the interest rate on federaJJy backed student loans is set to drop fiom the current 8.25 percent. ...
But chances that students wiJJ ever see those savings are about as slim as finding a campus parking space during

1998

The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 adopt the Clinton Administration's proposal to slash student
loan interest rates. Specifically, the new law:

Cuts Interest Rates on New Student Loans bv Almost a Full Percentage Point -- Saving Students $11 Billion Over
the Life of Their Loans. The new law extends for 5 years the low student interest rate on new loans first won
in the 1993 budget, proposed again in February by Vice President Gore, and available on a temporary .basis
since July 1. This lower student rate is set at the 3-month Treasury Bill + 2.3 (currently 7.46 ), a substantial
drop from the pre-July 1 rate of T -Bill + 3.1 (about 8.25 ) on new student loans. The low rate is now
available on all new student loans in the Direct Loan and Government-Guaranteed Loan (FFEL) programs.
Students will save roughly $50 per $1,000 of debt, over a ten-year repayment period, as result of the interest
rate reduction.

Allows Borrowers to Refinance Outstanding Loans at the Lower Rate. The new law extends for four months
the current 7.46 interest rate on Direct Consolidation Loans. Mter four months, the interest rate on Direct
Consolidation Loans will rise to the weighted average rate of the· underlying loans, rounded up to the nearest
one-eighth and capped at 8.25 .

The Administration is disappointed that the law contains an unnecessary new lender subsidy, and that it does
not extend the low Direct Consolidation Loan rate for a longer period of time or ensure that it is available to
borrowers who consolidate their student loans through private lenders in the FFEL program. The
Administration hopes Congress will revisit these issues in the future.

Helps Millions of Americans Pav for College.

More than half of all undergraduates have to borrow money to pay for college today, and more than half of
those with student loans have incomes under $30,000.

·       An elementary school teacher in Boston, who earned a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education
        and is struggling to repay $43,000 in student loan debt on her $16,000 annual income, can save
        about $3,500 in interest from the new low interest rate; and

·       A young married couple, trying to pay back $160,000 in loans from law school while working in
        public interest jobs, can save almost $25,000 in interest from the new low interest rate.

Builds on Clinton Administration Initiatives to Make College More Affordable for Students and Families. These
include: the historic higher education tax cuts enacted last year -- the HOPE Scholarship and the Lifetime
Learning Tax Credit, the flexible repayment options available through Direct Lending, the expansion of
College Work Study, AmeriCorps, and the increase in the maximum Pell Grant.

the financial services industry. Customer service will improve, and the public's confidence in the
administration of student aid programs will grow.
Context for Change. Under the leadership of Vice President Gore, the National Partnership for
Reinventing Government developed model legislation for establishing PBOs in federal offices. The new
HEA law is the first legislation to formally establish a PBO in the federal government. During the past 15
years, numerous state, local and foreign governments have implemented similar performance-based models
to improve services and reduce costs.
Reinventing for Results. A PBO is a new way of getting things done in the public sector -- a results-driven
organization created to deliver the best possible services -- by establishing incentives for high performance
and accountability for results, while also allowing more flexibility to promote innovation and increased
efficiency.
Specifically, the PBO will be held accountable for performance objectives that include: improving
customer satisfaction; providing high quality, cost-effective services; enhancing the ability to respond to the
rapid rate of technological change; implementing a common, open, integrated system for student financial
aid delivery; and providing complete, accurate and timely data to ensure program integrity.

Establishing New Flexibilitv and Accountabilitv. The new HEA law that creates the PBO includes the
following major provisions:
Leadership. The PBO will be led by a chief operating officer (COO) with a strong background in
     information technology and management, who is employed through a performance-based contract
     and reports directly to the Secretary;
Procurement flexibility. The PBO will have increased flexibility in procurement, with an emphasis on
     performance-based contracting;
Management and personnel flexibility. The PBO will have limited new flexibility in personnel
     management, including hiring and evaluating senior managers, and recruiting technical personnel;
     and
Accountability for results. The COO and employees of the PBO will have specific, measurable
     perforrnance goals, ensuring accountability for defined results.

The Secretary will continue to be responsible for setting federal student aid policy.

The PBO will complement and strengthen reinvention initiatives already underway within the Department,
including Project EASI (Easy Access for Students and Institutions) and other efforts to modernize student
aid programs.                                                                              .

Title II of the new law authorizes a $300 million investment in teacher preparation and recruitment in the
upcoming fiscal year. The House's FY99 Appropriations bill allocates $2.2 million for teacher
recruitment, and the Senate's Appropriations bill allocates $77.2 million for the following HEA initiatives:
Teacher Preparation Partnerships. This new initiative will provide grants to partnerships -- based on the
Administration's proposed Lighthouse Partnerships -- between teacher preparation institutions and local
school districts in high-need areas. To ensure that new teachers can meet the many challenges of today's
classrooms, the partners will work to strengthen teacher education through activities such as:
Implementing reforms that hold teacher education programs accountable for preparing high-quality teachers.
Improving the academic content knowledge of prospective teachers through increased collaboration between
   faculty at schools of education and departments of arts and sciences;
Ensuring that teachers are well-prepared for the realities of the classroom by providing strong hands-on
   classroom experience and strengthening links between university and K -12 school faculties;
Preparing prospective teachers to use technology as a tool for teaching and learning;
Preparing prospective teachers to work effectively with diverse students; and

Recruitment Partnerships. Modeled after the highly successful Dewitt Wallace Reader's Digest Foundation's
"Pathways to Teaching" program, this new recruitment initiative will provide grants to states and to
partnerships between high-quality teacher education programs and local schools in high-need communities
to recruit new teachers. Prospective teachers who agree to teach in high-need areas for a set number of
years will receive scholarships and other support during their preparation and first years of teaching.

State Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants. These new grants encourage states to improve the quality of
their teaching force by:
Strengthening their teacher certification standards to ensure that new teachers have the necessary teaching
   skills and academic content knowledge;
Implementing reforms that hold institutions of higher education accountable for preparing teachers who have
    strong teaching skills and knowledge of their content areas;
Establishing or strengthening alternative pathways into teaching for highly qualified individuals, including
    mid-career professionals and former military personnel; and
Recruiting new high-quality teachers.

Accountabilitv. The new law helps ensure accountability in teacher education by requiring states and
institutions of higher education to prepare "report cards" on the quality of teacher preparation, including
their students' performance on teacher licensing examinations.

The new HEA teacher preparation and recruitment initiatives will promote partnerships and teacher
preparation activities similar to the award-winning projects described below.

       Massachusetts: Samuel Mason Elementary School in Roxbury, Massachusetts, had a great need for
       teachers qualified to work with children who need special education services, because 25 of these
       students were fully included in regular classrooms. The school solved its problem by partnering
       with Wheelock College to develop a teacher preparation program that provides new and
       experienced teachers with dual certification in special education and regular education.

       Pennsylvania: In Philadelphia, Drexel University has partnered with the Philadelphia Public
       Schools to recruit a diverse teaching force to serve as early childhood, math, and science teachers.
       Also in Philadelphia, Temple University is working with the local school district to recruit and
       prepare returned Peace Corps volunteers to be early childhood, elementary, math, science, and
       ESL teachers.

       Texas: The teacher preparation program at the University of Texas at El Paso is designed,
       implemented, and evaluated through a collaboration of elementary and secondary school teachers
       and administrators, university facuity, the staff of the regional Texas Education Service Center, and
       community members. The curriculum emphasizes bilingual and cross-cultural education to
       prepare students to teach effectively in predominately Hispanic elementary and secondary schools.
       The program also uses a strong clinical model in which students work intensively in 18
       professional development schools committed to school improvement.
       Virginia: Capitalizing on the nearby military base, Norfolk State University in Virginia has
       collaborated with Old Dominion University and Norfolk Public Schools to recruit and prepare
       paraprofessionals and retired military personnel to become successful teachers. The program offers
       both financial and academic support for prospective teachers through a grant from the DeWitt
       Wallace Reader's Digest Fund.

       Wisconsin: Alverno College in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, works with local schools to provide an
      innovative, performance-based teacher preparation program. Students are expected to demonstrate
      their mastery of a variety of skills essential to good teaching, such as: problem solving, involving
      the community in education, and integrating content knowledge with classroom practice. Upon
      completion of their extensive student teaching experience, the clinical preparation of Alverno
      students is assessed by a panel of Alverno faculty and teachers and administrators at their
      elementary or secondary schools. Currently, faculty and administrators at the College are working
      with three other institutions to improve their teacher preparation programs by adopting elements of
      the Alverno model.

    Distance education can help all Americans -- including workers, parents, people in rural
    communities and people with disabilities -- go to college by removing barriers of time and place
    through innovative uses of technology.
    While colleges and universities have been exploring the uses of technology, its capacity for
    increasing access to higher education has been limited because of restrictions on financial aid
    availability for distance learners. Only about one-third of all higher education institutions offered
    distance education in 1995, and they served fewer than one million students.

    Distance Education Demonstration Programs. The new law authorizes Demonstration Programs to
    increase sUldent access to higher education and to determine the best way to deliver quality
    education through distance learning. Because the current eligibility requirements for higher
    education institutions do not address the special needs and circumstances of distance learners, needy
    students are sometimes ineligible for financial aid. The Demonstration Programs will expand
    student aid eligibility for distance learners by allowing the Secretary to waive specific statutory and
    regulatory student aid requirements for participating institutions. Among the requirements that may
    be waived are those regarding measures of an academic year, minimum hours spent in the
    classroom, and the percentage of an institution's students that may be served by distance education.
    This change will provide new flexibility for institutions to offer high-quality distance education
    programs. Up to 15 degree-granting institutions, consortia, or systems of institutions may participate
    in Distance Education Demonstration Programs the first year, and up to 50 may participate in the
    third year.
    Learning Anytime Anywhere Partnerships CLAAP). The new law authorizes the LAAP program,
    which will provide competitive grants to partnerships to ensure that high-quality learning
    opportunities are available to distance education students. The partnerships will develop and assess
    model distance education programs and educational software and find innovative measures of
    student achievement that are appropriate for distance education. Eligible partnerships will include
    two or more independent organizations, such as: colleges, community-based organizations,
    technical institutes, adult education programs, school districts, and businesses. LAAP grants will
    encourage'institutions and their partners to work together to provide high-quality distance education
    programs that challenge traditional geographic and institutional boundaries. The new law
    authorizes this program at $10 million in FY99, and the Senate,' but not the House, FY99
    Appropriations bill provides the full $10 million,
