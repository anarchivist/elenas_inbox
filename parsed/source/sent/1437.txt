TEXT:
I read the draft this weekend and agree.  Mike Cohen wrote a much more
interesting outline, from an "educator's perspective," which I will send
you. But in the end, I think we should let the EEOC (and Wade) know that
we will not be filing a brief.  I'll try to grab you for a minute or two
on Monday to discuss how best to convey that message.

I have reviewed the EEOC draft and, wholly apart from the views expressed
in the note, continue to believe that a US brief will not fly -- certainly
not in the form suggested by the EEOC.  Let's discuss how to proceed.
