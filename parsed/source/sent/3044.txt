TEXT:
This looks great. Here are just a couple of comments.
1. On several occasions, you suggest that the "emergency exception" is the only
exception to the general rule against obligating the govt in the absence of an
appropriation.   But as I understand it, there are a couple of others.  Most
important, activities essential to the President's constitutional role
 (principally foreign affairs and national security) can go on, even if there is
no emergency.   In addition, employees responsible for implementing the shutdown
and maintaining activities that have multi-year or permanent appropriations may
work, again even if there is no emergency situation under the standard used in
the OLC memo. This comes up in the last full para on p.3, the first full para
on p.4, and the answer to question 4 (although there your phrasing is broader) .
with respect to the last, sa substantial number of White House employees could
be exempt from furlough not because of the emergency exception but because of
the executive function exception.
2. Bob Damus, Chris Schrader, and I still have to talk about whether "current
law permits furloughed white house employees to volunteer." I take it there is
currently some disagreement on the subject.
3. Much less important, the estimates of cost on p.5 implicitly assume that
furloughed employees will eventually be paid.    Perhaps we should assume that; I
just note the assumption.
4. And finally, I take it our answer to question 1 is the same even if Members
don't get paid?    I have to believe that Members will waive their pay, so that
we eventually won't have this line of argument open to us.
