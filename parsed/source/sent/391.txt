MEMORANDUM FOR SYLVIA MATHEWS AND MARK PENN

FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                         ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                 IDEAS

        Because Bruce will miss this week's political meeting, we thought the following status
report on ideas for executive action might prove useful.

Ideas from last week

Aids Vaccine: We are still vetting the proposal for the President to issue a challenge on
developing an AIDS vaccine. Elena may know more tomorrow, and will fill Sylvia in.

Race Commission: We are currently reviewing a proposal to establish a President's Commission
on Racial Reconciliation. We will have a recommendation ready within the next week or two.

Consumer Bill of Rights/Quality Commission: The counsel's office is currently vetting our
nominations for the Quality Commission, which will be charged with developing a patient Bill of
Rights. We have been told that the nominations will not be ready for announcement until the
week of March 10. Announcement of the Commission can be combined with the release of a
HHS regulation thilt would guarantee an expedited appeal whenever a plan proposes to deny care
that a Medicare patient believes is urgently needed.

Home Health Care Regulation: After reviewing the home health care regulation, DPC and
HHS concluded that it was not substantive enough to warrant a presidential event. As a result, it
will be released next week during HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck's congressional
testimony. We have asked HHS, however, to review more substantive regulatory or legislative
proposals that we could announce in the future. One such proposal, which will not be ready for
at least several weeks, would require criminal background checks for home health providers
participating in Medicare.

New ideas you asked about

Ban on Human Cloning: Congress has banned the use of federal funds for cloning, but privately
funded research is not similarly restricted. The President could call on the scientific community .
to institute a moratorium on human cloning research -- at least while the National Bioethics
Advisory Committee implements the President's request to study the issue over the next 90 days.
 We will make a recommendation next week on this possible action.

                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion


Extradition of Child Pornographers: We are still discussing this issue with the Justice
Department. We will have a better sense of possible actions next week.

Tobacco Advertising: We are reviewing a proposal for the President to make a statement
regarding tobacco companies' use of the internet and other fora to get around our tobacco rule.
To mitigate First Amendment concerns, our rule focused on the particular kinds of tobacco
advertising that are most likely to reach children. Notwithstanding this focus, our rule faces a
stiff legal challenge in the courts. Any statement now on other tobacco advertising may
compromise our efforts to defend the rule's carefully drawn provisions. We are discussing this
concern with the Justice Department and FDA. Preliminary discussions suggest that the
President should not make a statement this Friday.

Testing in Military Schools: We are currently looking into securing the commitment of the
Department of Defense to give students in its schools our proposed 4th and 8th grade tests. (We
believe it would be preferable for DOD to volunteer to give these tests than for the President to
order the Department to do so.) We should know next week whether DOD will agree.

Advisory Panel for Education Tests: The Education Department is putting together a panel of
teachers and other trusted educators to advise on the development of our 4th and 8th grade tests.
We are attempting to press this forward as soon as possible, but need at least a few weeks to
determine the best structure for the panel and to vet potential appointees.

Other ideas

Medicare fraud legislation: We are working with HHS to finalize a new package of fraud and
abuse initiatives for unveiling the week of March 10. Since Florida is the "fraud and abuse
capitol" of the nation, we believe the President's visit there would provide an excellent
opportunity to announce the new package. Governor Chiles would give the package a strong
endorsement.

Governmental hiring of welfare recipients: Weare currently putting together a package of
proposals to facilitate the federal government's hiring of welfare recipients. We think that this
package will include an executive order establishing a separate hiring track for welfare recipients
and providing nonfinancial incentives to federal agencies to make use of this new hiring
authority. We hope to be ready to go by the end of next week.

Classified research with human subjects: In response to recommendations ofthe President's
Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, we have prepared (1) an Executive
Order strengthening protections for human subjects of secret research; and (2) legislation
expanding compensation for Cold War-era uranium miners. With one week's notice, we can be
ready to announce these policies and release a summary report detailing the Administration's full
response to the Committee's 18 recommendations.

Seat Belt Study: The Department of Transportation will give the President a report on March 10
on ways to increase seat belt use. DOT's report is likely to include ideas for presidential
challenges to states and business groups, as well as a proposal (consistent with our budget) to
offer financial incentives to states to improve and enforce seat belt laws.

Children's Health EO: The DPC, NEC, CEQ, and OSTP are working on an executive order
designed to ensure that the federal government considers the special needs of children when
taking regulatory action. The executive order requires every agency to determine whether a
regulation may impose disproportionate risks on children and, if so, to evaluate the specific
effects of the regulation on children. The order may be ready within a few weeks, but with
interagency discussions still going on, there is some possibility of a last-minute hitch.

Welfare-to-Work Transportation Plan: We can announce at any time our Access to Jobs
proposal, which would allocate $100 million ofISTEA funding to improve transportation
systems so that welfare recipients and other low-income workers could get to work more easily.
Lack of convenient and affordable transportation is currently an obstacle to getting people from
welfare to work, and this proposed program is a very serious attempt to address this problem.

Service Summit: We could announce "commitments" from the federal government to the
service summit -- proposals for how the federal government can support service and voluntarism
to help youth. We could be ready to make such announcements in 2-3 weeks if necessary.
