    TEXT:
    Could we also mention (in the part of tpe speech that lists the things we
    need to make standards work) ways to hold schools accountable -- e.g. by
    taking over failing schools and/or tran'sforming them into charters. We
    probably should mention here that Rosa/parks is trying to start a charter
    school in Detroit.
