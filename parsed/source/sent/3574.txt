TEXT:
I just got a call from Mike Small, who tells me that all of DOJ made a mistake
and that the Aguilar brief is really due on October 29 (not November 8).  In
addition, while talking with David Ogden this morning, I put in a request to see
an advance copy of this brief. Now that the due date is so near, I think we
should press this request ASAP. Agree?
