TEXT:
Bruce Reed asked me to talk to you about getting me into tomorrow's welfare
meeting. Bruce thinks it might be a good idea to have a lawyer in the room for
all the times the HHS folks say that something can't legally be done.   Let me
know if it's OK for me to attend -- and if so, when the meeting is.   Many
thanks.
