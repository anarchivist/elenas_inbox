  TEXT:
  I agree with Bruce about what's needed here.  I think we should push for
  the addition of a first chapter that tries to link community policing
  strategies with the reduction of crime -- that shows that these strategies
  actually work.  In effect, the new chapter would back up the third
  paragraph of the foreword, which makes some quite broad (and good!) claims
  about community policing and its link to controlling crime.   ("The crime
  data confirm that those agencies most committed to community policing .
  . are the ones that experience the largest decreases in crime.")   I'm
  assuming that we won't be able to "prove" this beyond a shadow of a doubt;
  still, I think it's worth making the effort.  One way to do it it just to
  compare the crime reduction statistics of these communities to those of
  comparable communities that haven't put community policing strategies into
  effect. Or compare the statistics of these 10 communities (and others
  using the same strategies?) with statistics nationwide.  There's just got
  to be a way to do this -- maybe not a way that can't be contested by some
  political scientist, but a way that's good enough for the average person.
  Also: why isn't New York in this report?

  The draft report looks fine.  It might have more news value if it focused
  more on crime reduction statistics, or if it came to some conclusions
  about what kinds of new strategies work.  But it's useful propaganda in
  any event.

  It's such a great program, they can't really bungle an account of it.  But
  I was a little surprised to read the Boston chapter, which credits the new
  chief with completely turning the Boston force around when he took over in
  1994 -- completely ignoring the fact that he took over from Bratton, the
  most effective chief of all time.  I assume all the chapters are joint
  press releases between DOJ and the sitting chief.
