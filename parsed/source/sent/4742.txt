We'd like to put together a master list of action/event ideas -- things

the

President can do in all the areas we work on.     Please include actions

already

in the planning stage, as well as ideas still on the drawing board (or

entirely

in your own head).     We'd like the first installment by Thursday, but

consider

this a continuing project: as you think up or hear about ideas, please

keep

feeding them in.     Thanks.
