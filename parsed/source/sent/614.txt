TEXT:
I completely forgot to tell you that a week or so ago (after a 7:45
meeting), Craig and Marsha asked me whether we would want the President to
do a meeting with Giuliani and a Democratic big-city mayor focusing on our
legal immigrant package and also addressing welfare-to-work efforts
generally. Apparently, Giuliani has asked for such a meeting, and
Marsha/Craig came up with the idea of adding a Democrat to the mix.  I
said we'd like a meeting like this. Agree?
