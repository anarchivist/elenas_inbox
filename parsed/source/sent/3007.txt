TEXT:
Late in the day, BD lawyer Evans, in response to a question by McCullum, noted
Jahn's testimony that certain tapes reveal that the BDs were spreading fuel and
preparing to set a fire as the gas was coming in. Evans said Jahn's description
of the tapes was accurate and then asked why the FBI agents on the scene didn't
hear the same thing (and if they did hear it, why they didn't react to it).   I
had never heard this criticism before. Unless this is a wholly absurd line of
attack (and maybe even if it is), I wouldn't be surprised if some Republicans
pick up on this in the next few days.
