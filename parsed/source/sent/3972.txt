Subject:         House Judiciary Committee Markup of Volunteer Liability
Legislation

The House Judiciary Committee reported out the volunteer liability
legislation earlier this evening by a 20-7 vote. As expected, the
Committee substituted the Senate-passed language for the underlying Porter
legislation.  The Committee adopted two amendments to the Senate language
during consideration. The first amendment clarified that the bill is only
applicable to those cases filed after the date of enactment.  The second
amendment, offered by Sheila Jackson Lee, ensures that any volunteer who
works for an organization that commits hate crimes is not covered by the
bill's liability limitations.  Committee Democrats also offered amendments
to highlight our concerns with the legislation including amendments to
strike the state preemption language and the limit on joint and several
liability. These amendments were not adopted.

Given that two amendments were adopted by the Committee, the measure now
differs from the Senate bill.  This means the bill must either return to
the Senate (where the amended measure must be passed); sent into
conference with the Senate (unlikely); or stripped of the amendments at
the House Rules Committee and sent to the House for consideration in its
original Senate-passed form.  No indication yet as to which course of
action will be pursued.  FYI.
