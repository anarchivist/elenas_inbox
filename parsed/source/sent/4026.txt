TEXT:
Can you put on a cover memo as follows:  "Attached is a meorandum from
Secry Shalala on state use of TANF monies.  DPC recommends that you use
some of the facts and ideas in this memo in a major speech on welfare
reform sometime this summer (perhaps to a state legislature), where you
would talk about what kinds of state policies promote -- and what kinds
retard -- real welfare reform."
