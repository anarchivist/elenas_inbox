                               . IN THE 21sT CENTURY


       In his State of the Union address tonight, the President will make clear that his number
one priority for the next four years is to ensure that Americans have the best education in the
world. He will issue a 10-point call to action for American education in the 21 st Century to
enlist parents, teachers, students, business leaders, local and state officials in this effort:

       Set rigorous national standards, with national tests in 4th grade reading and 8th
       grade math to make sure our children master the basics. Every 4th grader should be
       able to read; every 8th grader should know basic math and algebra. To help make sure
       they do, the President is pledging the development of national tests in 4th grade reading
       and 8th grade math, and challenging every state and community to test every student in
       these critical areas by 1999. These tests will show how well students are doing compared
       to rigorous standards and to their peers around the country and the world. They will help
       parents know if their children are mastering critical basic skills early enough to succeed in
       school and in the workforce. Every state and school should also set guidelines for what
       students should know in all core subjects. We must end social promotion: Students
       should have to show what they've learned in order to move from grade school to middle
       school and from middle school to high school. We must make sure a high school
       diploma means something.

       Make sure there's a talented and dedicated teacher in every classroom. In addition
       to the talented and dedicated teachers already in the classroom, two million new teachers
       will be needed over the next ten years to replace retirees and accommodate rapidly
       growing student enrollments. We must take advantage of this opportunity to ensure
       teaching quality well into the 21 st Century by challenging our most promising young
       people to consider teaching as a career, setting high standards for entering the teaching
       profession, and providing the highest quality preparation and training. We should reward
       good teachers, and quickly and fairly remove those few who don't measure up. The
       President's education budget will make it possible for 100,000 master teachers to achieve
       national certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards over
       the next ten years.

       Teach every student to read independently and well by the end of the 3rd grade.
       Reading is the key to unlocking learning in all subjects. While America's 4th graders
       read on average as well as ever, more than 40 percent cannot read as well as they must to
       succeed later in school and in the workforce. Research shows that students unable to read
       well by the end of the 3rd grade are more likely to become school dropouts and truants,


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
 nationwide effort to mobilize a citizen army of a million volunteer tutors to make sure
 every child can read independently by the end of the 3rd grade. Parents, teachers, college
 students, senior citizens, and others can all pitch in to give children extra help in reading
 during the afternoons, weekends, and summers. At the same time, schools must
 strengthen the teaching of reading in the school day, and the President's budget invests
 more in programs that address reading achievement in school.

  Expand Head Start and challenge parents to get involved early in their children's
  learning. A child's learning begins long before he or she goes to school. That's why the
  President's budget expands Head Start to cover one million children by 2002. Parents are
  their children's first teachers, and every home should be a place of learning. The
  President and First Lady will convene a Conference this spring to review recent scientific
. discoveries on early child learning and to show how parents, teachers, and policymakers
  can use this new knowledge to benefit young children. And in June, the Vice President
  and Mrs. Gore will host their sixth annual family conference, and focus on the importance
  of parents' involvement throughout a child's education.

Expand choice and accountability in public education. The President has challenged
every state to let parents choose the right public school for their children. Innovation,
competition, and parental involvement will make our public schools better. We must do
more to help teachers, parents, community groups, and other responsible organizations to
start charter schools-innovative public schools that stay open only as long as they
produce results and meet the highest standards. The President's budget doubles funding
to help start charter schools so that there will be 3,000 charter schools at the dawn of the
21st Century, providing parents with more choices in public education.

Make sure our schools are safe, disciplined and drug-free, and instill American
values. Students cannot learn in schools that are not safe and orderly and do not promote
positive values. We must find effective ways to give children the safe and disciplined
conditions they need to learn, such as by promoting smaller schools, fair and rigorously
enforced discipline codes, and teacher training to deal with violence. We should continue
to support communities that introduce school uniforms and character education, impose
curfews, enforce truancy laws, remove disruptive students from the classroom, and have
zero tolerance for guns and drugs. We should also keep schools open later as safe havens
from gangs and drugs, expanding educational opportunities for young people in the
afternoons, weekends, and summers, and providing peace of mind for working parents.

Modernize school buildings and help support school construction. Just as we face
unprecedented and growing levels of student enrollment, a recent report by the General
Accounting Office shows that a third of our nation's schools need major repair or outright
replacement. To keep ~hildren from growing up in schools that are falling down, the
Administration has proposed $5 billion to help communities finance $20 billion in needed
school construction over the next four years.
Open the doors of college to all who work hard and make the grade, and make the



                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                    IieJ(-Pump ConvOlIlon
the 21 st Century, we must open the doors of college to all Americans and make at least
two years of college as universal as high school is today. The President's HOPE
scholarship, a $1,500 tax credit for college tuition, would be enough to pay for a typical
community college tuition or provide a solid down payment for four-year colleges and
universities. The President also is proposing a $10,000 tax deduction for any tuition
after high school, an expanded IRA to allow families to save tax-free for college, and the
largest increase in Pell Grants for deserving students in 20 years.

Help adults improve their education and skills by transforming the tangle of federal
training programs into a simple skill grant. Learning must last a lifetime, and all our
people must have the chance to learn new skills. Adults should take on the responsibility
of getting the education and training they need, and employers should support their efforts
to do so. The President's G.!. bill for workers would provide a simple skill grant that
would enable eligible workers to get the education and training they need.

Connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000 and help all
students become technologically literate. Our schools must now prepare for a
transition as dramatic as the move from an agrarian to an industrial economy 100 years
ago. We must connect every classroom and library to the Internet by the year 2000, so
that all children have access to the best sources of infonnation in the world. The
President is proposing to double the funding for America's Technology Literacy
Challenge, catalyzing private-public sector partnerships to put the Infonnation Age at our
children's fingertips. CEOs of some of America's most innovative technology and
communications finns have already responded to the President's challenge to work with
schools to get computers into the classroom, link schools to the Internet, develop
effective educational software, and help train our teachers to be technologically literate.
