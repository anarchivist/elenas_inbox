TEXT:
in addition to anything else you have, please do entries (as I'm sure you
would anyway.) on each of next week's announcements/events: children's
health; quality; and race/health. Also: do we need to fill him on the
Missouri situation? do you want to say anything about his upcoming
meeting with the medicare commission? And did we ever get him an answer
to his question on malaria? -- he's now asked about this subject twice.
Thanks.
