belt use. I am seeking your clearance of a key proposal in the report. The report will set an
ambitous national goal for belt use (85% by 2000). To reach the goal, DOT is proposing, among
other things, that the Administration send legislation to Congress giving states a stonger
incentive to pass primary seat belt laws (i.e. laws that allow for ticketing soley for failure to use
a seat belt). The NEXTEA bill you announced March 12 includes financial incentives (grants)
for states to adopt primary seat belt laws. The new porposal would add a "soft sanction" -- states
that do not pass primary laws or achieve 85% belt use by October, 2002, would have 1.5% of
their federal highway funds (3% in subsequent years) transferred into their highway safety
programs.

The proposal is likely to be effective, since primary belt laws significantly increase belt use and
sanctions have effectively moved states to enact safety laws (e.g. zero tolerance laws). Eleven
states and DC already have primary seat belt laws, covering a third of all Americans. Belt use in
these states is 15% higher than in states with secondary enforcement laws. NHTSA estimates
that enactment of a primary law by the remaining 39 states would save 1,800 lives in the first
year alone.

The NGA and the governors'safety offices oppose the proposal (Governors Voinovich and Bob
Miller sent a letter to Frank Raines) as they have opposed other sanctions. The National
Mortorists Association, individual liberties groupus, and conservative and western Members of
Congress who allied to repeal sanctions in 1995 are also expected to oppose it. A broad
coalition will support the proposal, including auto maufacturers, insurance companies, safety
advocates, health groups, law enforcement officials, and the National Urban League. DOT
believes the proposal has a very good chance of getting congressional approval, particularly
because the air bag issue has focused public attention on the importance of seat belts.

Given your and Secretary Slater's commitment to improving auto safety and the expected benefits
of the proposal, I recommend you support it.
