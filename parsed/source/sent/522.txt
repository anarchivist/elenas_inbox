TEXT:
I don't have it on e-mail.  The only person who has the latest draft of
the press materials is Kathy McK because we changed a couple of things in
the morning while speaking with her on the phone.  If you get copies from
her, I'd be grateful if you made me a set. And come by my office anytime
and I'll see if I can fish out the directive.
