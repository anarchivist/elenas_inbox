TEXT:
Per our conversation, what I'd like to see is some language referring in policy
terms to Congress's grant of authority to states to deny benefits to legal
immigrants.  That would allow me to tag on something like the following:
"Moreover, particular state actions respecting legal immigrants, even if taken
pursuant to this congressional grant of authority, may run afoul of
constitutional standards.   If states wish to avoid protracted litigation over
whether they have sufficient justifications for such actions, then states will
decline to exercise this authority."
