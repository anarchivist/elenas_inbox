TEXT:
This looks great. Just a couple of comments:
1. The ban in fact does apply pre-viability, so perhaps the language you use
("could apply") is a bit weak -- even though many if not most of d&x abortions
are done post-viability.
2.  I would add after the word "finally," the following phrase: "I think the
bill makes a real mistake in picking and choosing among different kinds of
procedures." Then, go to .what you say -- "it is a physician's job" etc. --
except instead of just saying "the most medically appropriate method," say "the
safest and most medically appropriate method." I'd like to get in something
about safety here, and the "picking and choosing" language may make the point a
bit more punchy.
