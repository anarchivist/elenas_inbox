                                           July 22, 1998

          Dear Representative Greenwood:

                I am writing to express my c'oncern over Congress's plans to
          override my veto of H.R. 1122, a bill banning so-called partial
          birth abortions, rather than to/pass the legislation I have
          called for to prohibit this pro~~dure except when necessary to
          save the life of the mother or prevent serious harm to her
                                                    I
          heal th.  In taking this approac)1', Congress is jeopardizing the
          safety of women and using this p'ainful issue as an opportunity to
          score political points, rather than to pass needed legislation.

               The procedure addressed in H.R. 1122 poses a difficult and
          disturbing issue.   I strongly believe that we generally should
          prohibit the use of this procedure.   I have insisted, however, on
          exempting those few but tragic cases in which this procedure is
          necessary to save a woman's life or to protect her against
          serious injury.   I again call upon Congress to add such a narrow,
          tightly drawn exception to this bill, so that I can sign the
          legislation and put an end to,~ll other uses of this procedure.

               The legislation that you have sponsored with Representative
          Hoyer -- which prohibits all late-term abortions, except those
          necessary to save the life of a woman or prevent serious harm to
          her health -- is also consistent with my principles. As you
          know, I have long opposed late-term abortions, and as Governor of
          Arkansas, I signed into law           a
                                        bill that banned them, with an
          appropriate exception for th~ life or health of the mother.   If
          Congress were to pass your hill, I would sign it immediately.

                Congress's refusal to consider such constructive proposals -
          - proposals that would put        an
                                         end to inappropriate abortions
          while protecting women from death or serious injury -- prevents
          us from resolving these issues and moving forward.   Similarly,
          Congress's recent votes restricting safe medical choices and
          access to family planning ih~ormation and services stand in the
          way of progress on these isJues.I urge Congress once again to
          move beyond ideology and po~itical maneuvering, to protect
          women's lives and health, artd to reduce the need for abortions.
                                           if
                                           , Sincerely,



          The Honorable James C. Greenwood
