TEXT:
Food Safety -- As noted in the DPC weekly, USDA is currently working on
food safety legislation that would give the Secretary of Agriculture the
authority to recall contaminated food and to assess civil penalties for
noncompliance with safety standards. USDA should have the legislation
ready by next Tuesday.  Secretary Glickman (and perhaps the Vice
President) will announce the new legislation next week.  They will also
call for full funding of our food safety initiative in the Agriculture
appropriations bill; the current version of that bill is now about $4
million short of our request.
