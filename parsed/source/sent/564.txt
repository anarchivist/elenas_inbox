TEXT:
1.  I've talked with Barney Frank and Elizabeth Birch about the federal
employee benefits legislation Frank is introducing. He'd like us to sign
on at the beginning, and is willing to wait a few weeks for us to decide
whether we want to.  If we're not interested at all, he'd like to know
now, so he can introduce the bill next week.  What kind of process do you
think makes sense on this?

2. You told me a few weeks ago that you thought we should let sleeping
dogs lie on the question of unionizing the uniformed division of the
secret service.  I think you,Rahm, and I should discuss this matter,
because my best information is that the dogs aren't sleeping.  Let me know
when you want to talk.

3.  I'm still waiting for Justice to tell me something sensible on the
AFSCME Juvenile Justice question.  Sorry this is taking so long; I'll try
to step it up.
