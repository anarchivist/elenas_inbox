TEXT:
Looks good.  I would take out the 4th paragraph (beginning "policy
recommendations ... ). It's a kind of meaningless (and much too long)
list. The real -- or at least the comprehensible -- agenda is in the next
paragraph; if anything very important is missing from that paragraph, you
should just put it in.   Thanks.

PS -- Do you want me to call the press office?
