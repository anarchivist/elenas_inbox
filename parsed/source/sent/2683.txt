      I like this.  It's also very consistent with the way Joe said he was going
      to pitch it.

      Yes, definitely toughen up that paragraph about the vote.      Here's one
      idea:

      Last October, just before the November election, Republican members of
      Congress joined us in promising the American people more teachers and
      smaller classes. Now, just four months later, Republican leaders won't
      even allow a vote to reduce class size. This is the first big test of
      whether this congress is willing to work together to get things done, and
whether this Congress is serious about education. The choice is simple:
Are we going to give Americans smaller classes, or more partisanship?
