TEXT:
After reviewing the draft stat~ent and talking to OLC (Randy Moss because
Dellinger wasn't in), I suggest changing the second paragraph to read as
follows:
"The Resolution repeals two paragraphs relating to the Tongass National Forest,
which were mistakenly not deleted when the operative language was moved to
another section."
The paragraph as it now stands seems to me a tad too defensive: in particular,
the reference to the legislative history makes it sound as if we're making an
argument, rather than just stating a fact.  I also don't much like the reference
to the supsension provision, which has no real reason to be there. OLC agrees.
