                             SCHOOLS

In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton called on all states and school districts to
identify·and tum around their worst-performing schools -- or shut them down. In a visit to the
Jackson/Mann Elementary School in Boston, President Clinton announced a $200 million
initiative in his FY 2000 budget that will require states and school districts to take corrective
actions to improve low performing schools, and give them the resources to get the job done.

$200 Million to Turn Around Low Performing Schools. The President's FY2000 budget
includes a $200 million in new funds for the Title 1 program, to be set aside for intervening in
low performing schools. The President's proposal will require states and school districts to
identify the schools with the lowest achievement levels and the least improvement, and take
corrective action to tum them around. These corrective actions, based on a careful assessment of
each school's needs, would include steps such as intensive teacher training, support to improve
school discipline, and the implementation of proven approaches to school reform. If these
actions do not result in improved student achievement within two years, the President's proposal
would require states and school districts to take additional corrective actions, such as permitting
students to attend other public schools; reconstituting the school, by fairly evaluating the staff
and making staff changes as appropriate; or closing the school and reopening it as a charter
school or with an entirely new staff. The funds provided in the President's budget will be used
to support these interventions.

An approach that works. Experience demonstrates that when these interventions are carefully
implemented, are accompanied by the resources to support change, and are part of a broader state
and district strategy to raise academic standards, upgrade curriculum, strengthen teaching, keep
school safe and disciplined and implement proven practices, schools improve and student
achievement increases. For example, in the Fall of 1995 Florida identified 45 critically low
performing schools in Dade County. The Miami-Dade School District responded with Operation
Safety Net which requires schools to implement a school wide reading program, and provides
them staff assistance, improved technology and other resources. These schools are given 3 years
in which to make adequate progress or be subject to further action. After 3 years, Dade County
removed each of the 45 schools from the state's list of low-performing schools. New York City
has created the Chancellor's district, to provide low-performing schools with special intervention
to redesign the school, set instructional priorities, identify staff training needs and take other
steps improve student performance. In 1966, the Chancellor's District identified and took over
10 of the city's lowest performing schools, and by 1998 half had made enough improvement to
be removed from the Chancellor's direct control. In one successful school, P.S.154 in Harlem,
staff redesigned the school, chose a concentrated reading program, organized an education plan
around it, and trained all teachers to implement the plan. In the first year, the number of third-
grader students meeting state standards increased 20 percent, and student reading scores on a
statewide assessment have improved significantly. In 1992, Houston identified 68 low
performing schools, and as a result of the school district's intervention all of those schools have
increased achievement and are no longer considered low performing.

results, providing extra help to schools that need it, and closing down those that don't improve, is
a common sense approach to strengthening public education. President Clinton's proposal will
dramatically speed up the pace at which states and school districts begin to tum around low
performing schools. In March 1996, President Clinton challenged every state and school district
to take responsibility for intervening in low performing schools. According to a recent Education
Week study, nineteen states currently have policies and strategies in place to help improve low-
performing schools. More than half of these schools are in urban areas, and a growing number of
urban school systems, including New York City, San Francisco, Dade County, Philadelphia and
Chicago are taking similar steps, including the implementation of comprehensive school
improvement plans, after-school academic help to students, and intensive teacher training. The
Boston Public Schools have begun to implement an accountability plan that requires every school
to implement a school improvement plan, and that targets help and intervention to the lowest
performing schools. Under current Title 1 requirements, states and school districts participating
in Title 1 must begin to take corrective actions for low performing schools by school year 2003-
2004. The President's proposal will accelerate these efforts, and will ensuring that every state
and every school district with the lowest performing schools will start immediately to tum those
schools around.
