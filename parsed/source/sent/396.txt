Subject:         disability and naturalization update

.INS reports that OMB has the reg. for clearance. There weren't many
 modifications, so this should not be difficult to finalize.

INS hopes for the following schedule, if possible:

Monday -- The reg would be forwarded to the Fed. Register

Wednesday -- Posting

Thursday -- Publication



Also,  it appears that OLC is near to deciding that it is not possible
pursuant to existing law for a proxy or guardian to assent to the
naturalization oath on behalf of the disabled. Because of that likely
outcome,  Jamie Gorelick will probably have a DOJ internal meeting on
Monday to discuss various considerations/options regarding whether the
Administration should offer/support legislation that would allow this.
They would then brief us and we should try to be in a position to get that
issue decided fairly quickly at that point.   Different agencies are
likely to have different views.   HHS would probably urge yes.
Inteiestingly, the Department of State would probably say no (due to
concerns that a precedent allowing a proxy to renounce another's citiz
enship might be abused by some other countries to permit stripping of
citizenship without consent of a U.S. citizen who is in their country.)
INS is probably strongly divided.
