    Elena, you had asked me to forward to you a list of the administration
    people to include in the next meeting on child care -- this one, as we
    discussed, would focus specifically on the Conference.  If possible, it
    would be great to have this later this week, but I'll follow up with Laura
    about times. Thanks.
