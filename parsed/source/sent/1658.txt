                   SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE

SUBJECT:                        Initiative to Ensure the Safety ofImported Fruits and Vegetables


        During my Administration, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our entire food
safety system, including expanded research, education, and surveillance activities. We also have
put into place enhanced safety standards relating particularly to meat, poultry, and seafood
products. These measures are greatly improving the safety of the nation's food supply.

         We need to build on these efforts, and today I ask you to do so by focusing on the safety
of fruits and vegetables. Although the produce i\mericans eat is very safe, we can and must do
even better, particularly with respect to produce imported from foreign countries. Last year, 38
percent of the fruit and 12 percent of the vegetables consumed by Americans came from
overseas. We must ensure that these fruits and vegetables are produced under safety systems
equivalent to those existing in the United States, at the same time that we upgrade our own
domestic standards.

        As you know, I am introducing legislation in Congress that will help accomplish this task.
 This legislation will authorize the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to halt imports of fruits,
vegetables, or other food from any for~ign country whose food safety systems and standards are
not on par with those of the United States. This authority, which is equivalent to authority the
USDA now has to halt the importation of meat and poultry, will enable the FDA to prevent the
importation of potentially unsafe foreign produce. In addition, I will provide the necessary funds
in my Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to expand dramatically its international
inspection force. With this greatly increased ability to inspect food safety conditions abroad, the
FDA will be able to determine when to halt the importation of fruits and vegetables from foreign
countries.

        At the same time, I direct you to take administrative actions that will better ensure the
safety of fruits and vegetables coming from abroad, while continuing to improve the safety of
domestic produce. You should accelerate whatever food safety research is necessary to support
these actions.

         First, I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in partnership with the
 Secretary of Agriculture, to report back to me within 90 days with a plan on how to improve the
 use of existing and projected resources to monitor agricultural and manufacturing practices
abroad, assist foreign countries to improve those practices, and prevent the importation of unsafe
produce, including by detecting un~afe food at the dock or border. I especially urge you to
·consider the best ways to target inspection and testing resources toward those areas where
problems are most likely to occur.

       Second, I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in partnership with the
Secretary of Agriculture and in close cooperation with the agricultural community, to issue



                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion


     within one year guidance on good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for
     fruits and vegetables. This guidance should address such matters as sanitation, worker health,
     and water use, should take into account differences in both crops and regions, and should address
     potential food safety problems throughout the food distribution and marketing system. By
     providing the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and vegetables, the guidance will
     improve the agricultural and manufacturing practices of all those, foreign and domestic, seeking
     to sell produce in the U.S. market. To ensure that this guidance has the widest possible effect, I
     also direct the development of coordinated outreach and educational activities.

            These steps, taken together and in coordination with the legislation I will send to
     Congress, will ensure to the fullest extent possible the safety of fruits and vegetables for all
     Americans. I will also direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the
     Secretary of Labor to provide you with assistance in achieving this goal.




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
