     National Tests: Secretary Riley has received a letter from Governor Knowles expressing
     Alaska's commitment to participate in the national tests in 1999. In addition, in the past week
     we have received verbal confirmation that Gov. Romer, Gov. Carnahan and most likely Gov.
     Carper will sign on to participate in the tests. We also have verbal commitments from local'
     superintendent's in Broward County (FL), Cincinnati, Long Beach'and Philadelphia, in addition
     to the superintendent from San Antonio who announced her commitment at the family
     Conference. In anticipation of an announcement event on July 25, we are working to firm up
     these verbal commitments, and secure commitments from additional states and cities.


     Agostini v. Felton Decision Follow-Up
     Last Friday the Education Department wrote Chief State School Officers regarding the Supreme
     Court's Agostini v. Felton decision, making clear that public school teachers may now provide
     Title I supplementary instructional services to eligible children in religiously-affiliated private
     schools. The letter emphasized the Department's expectation that school districts will meet with
     local private school officials to examine whether they can arrange to take advantage of the
     Supreme Court's decision for the upcoming school year. Question and answer guidance will go
     to the field in mid-July, and meetings with both public and private school officials (including
     state Title I directors and the U.S. Catholic Conference) are being planned over the next month.
