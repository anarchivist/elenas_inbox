  Subject:         Religious Liberties Protection Act

          We have received word that Rep. Canady intends to move quickly on
  RLPA, the Religious Liberties Protection Act. In general, RLPA would
  create a religious free exercise defense to many state laws that are
  inconsistent with the religious beliefs or practices of individuals. In
  order to apply the law, the government would have to show that it was
  particularly important to apply the law to the individual with religious
  objections. You may recall that RLPA is a sequel to RFRA, the Religious
  Freedom Restoration Act. RFRA became law a few years ago but was largely
  struck down as beyond Congress's power. RLPA is intended to restore the
  major part of RFRA that was held unconstitutional.

          The President strongly supported RFRA, and it was widely supported
  in Congress. However, some of the potential implications of the bill are
  now better understood. In particular, RLPA could provide a religious
  liberties defense to many state laws, including some civil rights laws,
  such as fair housing laws that prevent discrimination against gays and
  lesbians and unmarried persons. This result is not certain, but it is
  certainly possible, at least in some states. As a result, the gay
  community,  supported by many civil rights groups, oppose RLPA as
  currently drafted. Last year, no Democrats on the House Constitution
  Subcommittee supported the bill after they heard from this community.
  Canady wants to move this bill quickly, and the Administration is going to
  have to decide how to respond. We will discuss the Administration's
  response to this bill on Monday at 1:00 in 472 OEOB. Representatives of
  DOJ will also attend. Can you come or send someone? Thanks.
