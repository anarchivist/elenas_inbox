 Subject:         Shays Hearing

 FYI

 Congressman Shays has scheduled a hearing for this Thursday regarding HHS
 and their informed consent procedures.  Testifying for HHS will be Harold
 Varmus (NIH), David Satcher (CDC) and others. Shays will touch upon
 different studies, such as the recent news regarding ethical concerns
 raised by Public Citizen over the use of AZT.

 The Committee will brief HHS later this week. At this time, HHS does not
 have major concerns with the hearing.  However, they will watch it closely
 to report if it has any negative implications for the President's Tuskegee
 announcement scheduled for May 16.
