Jane Lay of OGE is going to call you (Jack)    -- or may already have done

so.    I

think she will try to persuade you to abandon the idea of extending the

executive order prohibiting earned outside income to all political

appontees.

Per your last note, I asked Beth Nolan and Jane to prepare the language

amending the EO (and the accompanying OGE regs) in this way.     I take it

that

Jane wants to make a last stab at changing your mind before she gives us

the

language.     (Recall that we are acceding to her view that a ban on all

earned

income is better than a ban on honoraria alone; but she would prefer that

we

take neither action.)
