Subject:         Cloning

concerns
 if we receive a bill that impedes research but has a grandfather clause
or someother type of softener, do we sign?   this would be a frist/bond
bill w/changes.  in a war of words, what is an embryo, we lose. when is
an embryo an embryo (we lose).  i'm beginning to think, if there is no
middle ground and i don't think there is, we should consider a clean
fight.

i keep hearing from the hill that the repubs are trying to peel off the
research community.  if this is the case, we need to regroup.

rachel levinson will be back on friday.     can we regroup then?   elena,
what's a good time?
