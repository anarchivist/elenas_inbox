            The Hon. Henry Hyde
            Chairman
            Committee on the Judiciary
            U.S. House of Representatives
            Washington, D.C. 20510

            Dear Mr. Chairman:
,t i       1\RMS Email System                                                                     Page 2 ofll
           As you know, yesterday I unveiled a comprehensive proposal to strengthen
           our federal firearms laws in four important ways:  by (1) expanding the
           successful Brady Law; (2) further restricting youth access to guns; (3)
           cracking down on illegal gun traffickers; and (4) strengthening the ban on
           assault weapons.  In the coming days, I will transmit this legislation to
           Congress.  I believe that Congress should be able to pass within weeks or
           months everything in this legislation, which builds on efforts that have
           proved highly effective in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and
           youth. Consider some of the billD,s specific provisions:

           My legislation will extend Brady background checks to all gun show sales,
           as well as to the purchase of explosives. Justice Department studies show
           that Brady background checks have stopped hundreds of thousands of illegal
           handgun sales. Extension of the background check requirement to gun shows
           and explosives will strengthen our ability to keep dangerous weapons out
           of the hands of criminals.

           My legislation will raise the age of the current youth handgun      ban from 18
           to 21 years of age. With ATF gun trace data showing that more       crime guns
           are traced to 18 and 19 year-olds than to any other age group,      this
           proposal is an obvious way of reducing gun violence across the      country.

           My bill will also ban youth possession (again, until the age of 21) of all
           semiautomatic assault rifles and large capacity ammunition clips with more
           than 10 rounds of ammunition.  In 1994, you and other Republicans stood up
           to the gun lobby and supported the original ban on assault weapons, which
           applied to newly manufactured weapons. My legislation will prevent
           juveniles from owning these weapons regardless of the date of manufacture.

           And my legislation will limit handgun sales to no more than one per month
           per person, so that gun runners, hiding behind straw purchasers, cannot
           buy handguns in bulk and divert them to the street.  It will also help law
           enforcement to trace more crime guns to their source, and to crack down on
           gun dealers involved in illegal gun trafficking.

          For more than six years, we have made great progress in reducing
          gun-related crime and violence in America.  In fact, the number of violent
          crimes committed with guns has dropped by more than 25 percent during that
          time. Gun violence, however, remains a serious problem in our nation, and
          much more needs to be done.  Passing comprehensive firearms legislation is
          one thing we can and must do to address this important issue.  I ask that
          you bring these common-sense measures to a vote as quickly as possible.
