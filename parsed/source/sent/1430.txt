TEXT:
At a recent COS scheduling meeting, the powers-that-be suggested that
someone from DPC get together with you semi-regulalrly to go over a list
of upcoming regs.  I think that means me.  Could you call me so we can
figure out how it makes best sense to do this?

Also: what's happening with the "racial classification" issues for the
census. We were' supposed to hook up on this a while back, and never did.
