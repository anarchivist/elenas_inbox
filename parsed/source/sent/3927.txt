 TEXT:
 I just looked at the bill and it seems to me, notwithstanding the
 suggestion here, that the statute of repose provision continues to be
 one-way.

 JUDICIARY
 New Product Liability Bill Unveiled; Thursday Markup Set
    Senate Commerce Chairman McCain -- along with Senate Majority
 Leader Lott and Sens. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., and Slade Gorton, R-
 Wash. -- late Thursday night introduced a new product liability
 bill that is scheduled to be marked up by the Commerce Committee
 next Thursday. In introducing the measure, S. 648, Gorton said
 his goal was to obtain bipartisan support for a product liability
 measure. "I cannot say the bill I am introducing tonight
 accomplishes that," Gorton said, but added, "it comes very
 close." The bill most notably lacks the support of Sen. Jay
 Rockefeller, D-w.Va., who worked with Gorton in the 104th
 Congress and again this year to craft legislation that President
 Clinton would sign. Gorton said he was introducing the new
 measure to "get the process started" and pledged to continue

working with Rockefeller to enact reform legislation this year.
   Some industry sources complained today that the new bill makes
only "cosmetic" changes to a product liability measure introduced
earlier this year by Ashcroft that was virtually the same
legislation Clinton vetoed last year. The latest proposal would
expand the statute of repose or deadline for plaintiffs to sue
manufacturers to 18 years and pre~empt all· state statutes of
repose; exempt silicon breast implants from liability limits for
biomaterials manufacturers; explicitly prohibit protections for
those who sell guns to convicted felons or alcohol to people who
are intoxicated; and clarify that product liability protections
apply to all goods, rather than just durable goods protected in
last year's legislation.
