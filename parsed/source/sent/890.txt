TEXT:
Of course no problem.  Jim Kohlenberg has come to all our meetings on
getting ready for the NC decision.  If there's someone else who should be
there, just let me know. And whenever we figure out how to playa role in
the settlement issue, we will most assuredly let you know!  (Bruce R. and
I are meeting today with Bruce L to discuss the need to set up a
process.)  We want to work closely with you guys on this.
