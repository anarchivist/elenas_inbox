We did, and then we unaccountably let it slip.  It seems as if someone
canceled a meeting on the subject (to be attended by DPC, HHS, and Waters
staff) and then it was never rescheduled. We will make sure to make
contact her office again on Tuesday. As you know, both we and HHS have
substantial policy concerns about her proposal, but we should be giving
her every opportunity to make her case.

I hope by now Elena has made contact with her office.  I remember
forwarding two e-mails asking her to follow-up even if there was no
resolve.  Please check with her. Let me know if you find out anything.        I
haven't heard one way or the other.

On the note of the children, thanks for pushing me to do that. Boy were
they excited.  I will definitely show you the pictures.
