TEXT:
Jane Lay of OGE is going to call you (Jack) -- or may already have done
so.   I think she will try to persuade you to abandon the idea of extending
the executive order prohibiting earned outside income to all political
appontees.   Per your last note, I asked Beth Nolan and Jane to prepare the
language amending the EO (and the accompanying OGE regs) in this way.   I
take it that Jane wants to make a last stab at changing your mind before
she gives us the language.   (Recall that we are acceding to her yiew that
a ban on all earned income is better than a ban on honoraria alone; but
she would prefer that we take neither action.)
