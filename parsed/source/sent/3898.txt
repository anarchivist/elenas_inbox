TEXT:
Attached is a memo on products laibility I drafted for submission to the
President. Bruce Lindsey thinks it's what we need to (1) remind the
President of where we are and (2) get some indication from the President
of how much (if at all) he wants to give on the issue.   I take it that NEC
doesn't want the memo to go in; apparently, it wants to start some kind of
interagency policy process.  In any event, I thought you might want to see
this draft memo; I'd of course appreciate any suggestions.
