TEXT:
You haven't told me much about the seatbelt issue Jerry is working on
 (complaint alert!!!), but is it inconsistent with what's said in the first
bullet of this SAP -- that we want to retain the unbelted crash testing
requirement?
Also, are you comfortable with the reference in the fourth bullet on
"hiring preferences" for welfare recipients?

DRAFT --NOT FOR RELEASE
October 8, 1997
              (Senate)

S. 1173 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997
(Warner (R) virginia and 16 cosponsors)

Reauthorizing the NationD,s surface transportation programs is the
AdministrationD,s top transportation priority for this session of
Congress.  S. 1173 is a 6-year bill that addresses many of the President's
priorities, as reflected in the Administration's proposal to reauthorize
the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA).
While the AdministrationD,s preliminary review of the CommitteeD,s bill
indicates that it is not fully consistent with the Bipartisan Budget
Agreement (BBA) , the Administration understands that it is the managersD,
intent that the bill remain within the bounds of the carefully crafted
Agreement. The Administration supports this goal and urges the Senate to
craft a bill that is fully consistent with the Agreement. [The
Administration would strongly oppose amendments to the bill which would
further increase funding levels above those agreed upon in the BBA. --


clear this sentence w/ WH/LAl

The Administration commends the Senate for retaining ISTEAO,s
disadvantaged business enterprise goals and uniform certification
provision for highway projects, and would strongly oppose any amendment to
repeal or weaken these provisions.    In addition, the Administration would
oppose any amendments to weaken: the National Environmental Pol.icy Act,
the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (including
allowing single occupancy vehicle projects to receive funding under the
Program), or the Clean Air Act. The Administration is also committed to
retaining ISTEAO,s labor standards. and employee protection requirements
afforded working peop'le on federally assisted projects (including those
assisted by State infrastructure banks), and would oppose any amendments
repealing or limiting these protections. The Administration would oppose
changing the transit formula by adopting any form of minimum allocation
for transit.

S. 1173 is a significant intermodal transportation mea~ure, and the
Administration supports Senate passage if it is amended to:

  o      Make the bill fully consistent with the Bipartisan Budget
Agreement.

   o    Strengthen its safety provisions by -- retaining the unbelted
crash testing requirement; penalizing repeat drunk driving offenders at
the same blood alcohol level as first offenders; including the
AdministrationO", s criteria in the seat belt incentive program for States
to increase seat belt use rates; and eliminating the special exemption
from the Federal seat belt use law for New Hampshire.

  o     Authorize the full $2.2 billion requested by the
Administration for the Appalachian Development Highway System, and the
full $161 million requested for National Park roads and parkways.  The
funding levels currently authorized in S. 1173 are inadequate to support
these important programs.

  o     Provide additional flexibility to State and local governments
in establishing hiring preferences for in-State welfare recipients, in
order to meet the aggressive targets included in the recent welfare reform
law.

  o     Expand its intermodal focus by permitting State and local
governments to use Surface Transportation Program (STP) funds for publicly
owned freight rail infrastructure.

  o     Retain the current 10 percent set-aside of STP funds for
transportation enhancements.

  o     Delete Section 1115 which would unnecessarily expand Federal
Lands Program eligibility.

   o    Delete two provisions that would dilute the effectiveness of
the Hazard Elimination program by unnecessarily extending the program to
the Interstate System (which is already our safest system of roads), and
unnecessarily expanding program eligibility to include traffic calming
projects.

   o    Prevent confusion and duplication by deleting the provision
that would give States the option of using or not using the metric system
in connection with highway construction contracts.

   o   Delete the proposed Magnetic Levitation (MAGLEV)
Transportation Technology Deployment Program that calls for the Federal


Government to select and fund a MAGLEV demonstration project.  MAGLEV
projects should be advanced by individual States that deem MAGLEV a
priority, and the bill would allow States to use STP funds for this
purpose.

  o     Further expand the definition of capital to make paratransit
services for elderly Americans and individuals with disabilities an
eligible expense.

  o     Advance transportation projects more quickly and leverage
private and non-Federal investment by substituting the AdministrationO,s
State Infrastructure Bank and Credit Enhancement proposals for the billO,s
current Innovative Infrastructure Finance provisions.

Finally, the Administration supports the use of alternate fuels to improve
our nationO,s air quality, and therefore strongly supports the extension
of the excise tax exemption for ethanol (but without phasing down the
rates of the benefits) .


Pay-As-You-Go Scoring

.S. 1173 as reported would increase direct spending; therefore it is
 subject to the pay-as-you-go requirement of the Omnibus Budget
 Reconciliation Act of 1990. Therefore, if the bill were enacted and these
 costs are not offset during the remainder of this Congressional session, a
 pay-as-you-go sequester would be triggered at the end of the session.
 OMBO,s preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the
 table below.  Final scoring of this legislation may differ from these
 estimates.
