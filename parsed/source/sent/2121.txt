MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    Bruce Reed
                         Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 Tobacco Update

        Senator McCain announced a comprehensive tobacco bill today for mark-up on
Wednesday in the Senate Commerce Committee. The bill is not perfect, and we will continue to
seek improvements. But it represents real progress (see the attached chart comparing. the McCain
bill with the June 20th settlement and your positions), and it should enhance the prospects for
enacting comprehensive tobacco legislation in this session of Congress.

        The Commerce Committee is likely to pass the bill this week with bipartisan support.
Among Republicans, Senators Stevens, Gorton, Hutchison, Snowe, and Frist are likely to vote
yes; Senators Bums and Ashcroft are likely to vote no; Senators Abraham and Brownback are
undecided; and Senator Lott probably will recuse himself. Among Democrats, Senators
Hollings, Wyden, Breaux, and Kerry are likely to vote yes; Senators Rockefeller and Dorgan will
vote no; and Senators Bryan, Inouye, and Ford are undecided. The mainstream public health
groups (Heart Association, Cancer Society, etc.) called the bill an encouraging step forward, but
Drs. Koop and Kessler probably will criticize the bill because it contains some liability limits and
increases the price of cigarettes less than they would like. The industry responded to McCain's
announcement by saying that it would not agree to the legislation, but many observers believe
that the industry has taken this position only to prevent the price from increasing still further.

        Erskine gave the Administration's response to the bill in your absence. At a previously
scheduled speech at the Center for National Policy (given before McCain made the liability
provisions of the bill more acceptable to the public health community), Erskine said that the bill
laid a good foundation for future efforts, but had room for improvement. In addition to praising
Sen. McCain's leadership and process, Erskine lauded the legislation for raising the price of
tobacco products substantially, giving the FDA full authority to regulate tobacco products, and
including a strong plan to protect tobacco farmers. Erskine criticized the bill for having
inadequate lookback penalties, and noted that it did not contain a comprehensive plan for using
tobacco revenues to protect the public health and assist children. Erskine said he would not
address the liability issues because the rest of the legislation did not yet meet your principles.

       The bill emerged from a weeks-long process in which McCain consulted with the
Attorneys General, Wall Street analysts, public health leaders, and the Administration. As noted
above, at the last moment, McCain changed the liability provisions of the bill -- removing the bar


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                           2

       on class actions and probably on punitive damages -- to get the support of at least some members
       of the public health community. The final bill, which we summarize more fully below, addresses
       many of your concerns and offers   an
                                           opportunity for bipartisan accomplishment.

               1. Funding and Per-Pack Price Increase. The McCain bill essentially uses your budget
       numbers, raising approximately $70 billion over five years (including a $10 billion up-front
       payment) and generating a $1.10 increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes by 2003. The bill
       prevents the real price of tobacco products from increasing after the fifth year by including a
       volume adjustment on annual payments. Some in the public health world, as well as a number of
       liberal Democrats, will criticize the price rise as insufficient, arguing that an almost immediate
       $1.50 increase is required to reduce youth smoking dramatically. Your own plan, however,
       contains the same price increase, and we have estimated that it will help reduce youth smoking
       by over 40 percent in five years.

               2. FDA Regulation. The bill provides full authority to the FDA to regulate tobacco
       products. To respond to concerns from pharmaceutical companies about the effect of regulating
       tobacco under normal "drug and device" authority, we agreed to set up a separate chapter in the
       Food Drug and Cosmetic Act for tobacco products. We managed to do so, however, without
       ceding any of the authority the FDA has claimed over tobacco. This victory was hard-fought--
       Senators Hatch and Jeffords argued strenuously for language defining the FDA's authority more
       narrowly -- and will be subject to challenge on the floor. Senators McCain and Frist, however,
       have committed to fighting off weakening amendments, so we are in the best position possible
       (given a Republican Congress hostile to the FDA) to emerge from the Senate with full FDA
       authority.

               3. Farmers. The bill contains a plan to protect tobacco farmers and their communities,
       which has the support of Senators Hollings, Ford, and Robb. We do not yet know the full details
       of this piece of the legislation, but it is designed to address the concerns of both burley and flue-
       cured tobacco farmers. Needless to say, it will contain funds fully sufficient for these purposes,
       and accordingly meets your demand to protect tobacco farmers.

                4. Lookback Penalties. The bill provides for non-deductible industry-wide lookback
       penalties capped at $3.5 billion per year. The industry will have to pay $80 million for each
       percentage point by which it misses youth smoking targets between 0 and 5 percent, $160 million
       for each percentage point between six and ten percent, and $240 million for each percentage
       point over II percent. The industry will hit the $3.5 billion cap at about a 20 percent miss, so
       any larger miss will be "free." There are no monetary penalties on individual companies for
       failing to meet youth smoking targets. The bill does contain a provision for taking away the
       liability protections of any company that misses the youth smoking targets by more than 20
       percent, but this provision has a very large loophole and probably will have little effect as
       currently drafted.

              As Erskine noted in his speech, the penalty provisions are the weakest part of the McCain



                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

 bill. We have raised serious concerns about both the $3.5 billion cap and the absence of any
 company-specific penalties. We also will try to tighten the provision that makes liability
 protections contingent on success in reducing youth smoking. We assume that such amendments
 should not come in committee, but during debate on the floor.

           5. Liability Provisions. As late as Sunday, Senator McCain intended to include liability
. provisions very close to those in the proposed June 20 settlement. These provisions included a
  $6 billion cap on annual liability payments (with any judgments beyond the cap rolled over to the
  next year), as well as prohibitions on class actions and punitive damages. By Monday morning,
  however, the public health community (including the mainstream groups) had made clear to
  McCain that they would denounce the bill if it contained these provisions. McCain accordingly
  modified the legislation to permit class actions. We think the legislation now allows punitive
  damages as well, but we have not received the new language and are not entirely certain. Drs.
  Koop and Kessler and some liberal Democrats will oppose the bill because of the remaining
  liability limits.

         A simple cap on damages -- without any limitations on class actions or punitive damage
 claims -- is the least objectionable form of liability protection for the industry. We will try,
 however, to raise the cap beyond the level set in the McCain legislation; you should note, for the
 sake of comparison, that the Harkin-Chafee bill's cap stands at $12 billion.

          6. Budget Issues. The biggest issue left unresolved by the McCain bill is how to allocate
 tobacco funds. Although the bill takes care of tobacco farmers, and also provides money for
 smoking cessati'on, counteradvertising, and some research, it leaves other spending issues for the
 Senate floor. Senator Domenici's budget resolution would reserve all tobacco funds for
 Medicare, not even allowing the spending on farming and public health contained in the McCain
 bill. The Senate will take up amendments to this resolution tomorrow to make tobacco funds
 available for class size, child care, NIH, farmers, and other purposes, Many RepUblicans have
 raised concerns about the Domenici approach, but they may decide to vote for it, on the theory
 that as long as they have 60 votes for a tobacco bill, they can waive the budget rules anyway.

        When the time comes to engage in serious negotiations over how to allocate tobacco
funds, we expect bipartisan consensus on 75-80 percent of the spending ($10 billion over 5 years
for farmers; $10 billion for cessation, counteradvertising, and other public health programs; $10-
15 billion for NIH; and $20-25 billion for states). The battle will be over how to divide up the
remaining $15 billion or so. Senate RepUblicans will seek money for Medicare; House
Republicans may push Rep. Archer's proposal for health care tax deductions for small business
and the self-employed; and Democrats will push for everything from child care to school
construction.

        The emergence of the McCain bill is a very positive development. It will attract


                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion



                                                                                                         4

      bipartisan support, and it" is close to meeting your principles. We should continue, however, to
      press for real improvements -- particularly in the bill's penalty and liability provisions.
      Tomorrow, Erskine, Larry, and we will have meetings with Senators McCain, Hollings, and
      Daschle about how to move forward to enact the strongest possible tobacco legislation.
