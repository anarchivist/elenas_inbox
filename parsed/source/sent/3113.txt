TEXT:
1. The suggested change on pp. 12-13 looks great to me.
2.  If you can get DOJ to make the suggested change on p. 9, you're a better
person than I am.   "Caste system" rhetoric is used all the time in equal
protection law; in this part, DOJ means to plug into this well-known legal
tradition (even though the argument here is not, strictly speaking,
constitutional).  I have no objection to deleting this phrase, but I guarantee
you that it will be a battle.    For OLC, as for other constitutional lawyers,
this phrase has real meaning.
3.  I believe I disagree with the suggested change on pp. 3-5. OLe is on shaky
ground with respect to this argument: they know it, and everyone else will as
well.  To have any force or credibility at all, this section has to state the
opposing arguments, and deal with them.     (Otherwise, the whole argument will be
dismissed out-of-hand.)   Also, I don't think it's to our advantage to make a
constitutional argument stronger than it really is in a situation where the
President is likely, in the end, to ignore it.
