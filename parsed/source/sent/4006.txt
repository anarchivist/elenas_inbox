TEXT:
You may have noticed that the President got more press for his internet
v-chip remarks than for anything else he said down in west virginia.
Could you hook in with the VP's office (Don Gips seems the right person)
to find out what we're doing on this issue and whether we should/could be
doing more? thanks.
