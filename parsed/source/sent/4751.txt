Subject: Tuskegee



Looking at the materials on Tuskegee, it seems that we need to make some

decisions to move the process forward:



 1. Exactly what is the substance of this event: that is, in addiiton to

an

"apology" from the President, what are the policy corrections or

announcements
       ,..:."


that would be made and who would be resposnible for implementing them ? I

think

I    remember something going to the Bioethics Commission --what else? Has

DPC

signed off on a package ?



2. What are the options for the President's time? One hour is going to be

very

hard to find. How important is it that the President be there personally,

or

can we find a way to release his letter + policy ? Can we offer a range of

options that make it easier on scheduling ?



    A related question: where are we on announcing the next Surgeon General ?

Could this event be handled --not as part of his announcement          but as a

subject he takes up immediately upon assuming office ?



    3. I raise these questions not because I think the event is less

important but

becaues I do think it imprtant to taek some action and am concerned that

the

constraints on the President's time mean we have to be creatiev in

thinking how

to achieve it.
