TEXT:
FYI: Last week, Senator Domenici and Congressman Kasich requested Director
Rivlin to provide Congress with the shutdown plans of all "Executive Branch
agencies." Appearing before the Budget Committees this morning, Rivlin
explained that the plans were not ready yet, but indicated that she would
provide them soon.  The White House plan did not specifically come up, and I
suspect no one will press for it.   (None of the charts and tables that Rivlin
provided to Congress this morning listed the EOP, and no one commented on the
exclusion.)  But I suppose we should be prepared if Congress, upon recelvlng all
the agency plans, asks for the EOP's as well.   Let me know if you have any
thoughts about what to do in this event.
