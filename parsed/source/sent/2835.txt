Subject:         Civil Rights Coordinating Council

The CRCC is meeting at 5PM tomorrow. At the last meeting, Maria Echaveste
and Chuck Ruff requested a briefing (paper) that would give them an
overview of ESEA (they were particularly concerned with the social
promotions policy) .  I can give them summaries of major sections of the
bill based on draft paper that Education is producing to describe this
bill in plain-language -- but of course, it won't reflect the current
state of play on social promotions.  Is that ok with you?

Also, during the last meeting, Peter Rundlet reported that ED-OCR is
drafting guidance on high-stakes testing.  OCR is still revising their
draft to accomodate whatever changes are made in ESEA regarding the social
promotions policy.   I've asked Peter to make sure that he sends me a copy
of that draft guidance whenever it comes over from Education.
