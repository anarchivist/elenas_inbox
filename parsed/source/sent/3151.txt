TEXT:
Reports from Eugene, Oregon, re today's arguments in front of
Judge Hogan:
o       he didn't rule today; indicated that he will rule next
        week;
o       our attorneys did a terrific job;
o       but Hogan is clearly predisposed against the government;
o       he also ordered additional briefing on the issue of the
        enjoined sales that are before him;
o       unclear about the specifics on this one, but apparently
        enviro plaintiffs filed something in Hogan's court tOday
        seeking information regarding the methods we're using to
        identify the pre-FY 91 sales
