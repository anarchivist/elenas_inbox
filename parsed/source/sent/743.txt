TEXT:
Agree on the first.

On the second: Re Bruce's question: states will only be able to count
housing if the normal FLSA criteria are satisfied -- including that the
state provide the benefit to all employees doing the job.  More generally:
what's really the question here? does omb/hud want to consider
legislative changes prohibiting this practice?
