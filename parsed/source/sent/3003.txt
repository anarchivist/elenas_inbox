TEXT:
I'm sitiing on a number of speaking invitations -- everything from the Sidley &
Austin Summer Associate Speakers Program to a libel conference sponsored by the
Libel Defense Resource Center and the Newspaper Association of America to a
couple of academic conferences. Are there any rules associated with such things
if I don't take money and make clear that views expressed are only my own? Are
there any procedures I need to follow to get appearances approved? etc.
