I think it is more than a few hardliners, first of all. The critics of
the agreement even include public health officials who supported the first
settlement, and many of our allies in Congress.

Secondly, again, I assume our position is that each state should decide
what is best for itself in this regard.  I didn't hear the President on
Monday urge states to approve the agreement.

Third, it is important to point out -- without criticizing the settlement
-- what was not -- and could not have been -- included in it.  Again, the
goal here is NOT to criticize the settlement, but to explain to folks why
the settlement does not end the need for federal action.

Congress is the bad actor, not the settlement. But the settlement is not
a panacea, which I am sure you would agree with. And I would hate to see
us blamed for any "buyers remorse" that emerges from states accepting the
deal. And if state acceptance is inevitable anyway, why squander
credibility with validators whose support we may want for future,
controversial steps we take on this issue -- steps which, unlike this
settlement, that will truly be our own actions.
