         Finally, Senator McCain has provided great leadership in the Commerce Committee to
draft a bipartisan bill that we believe will significantly advance the process of enacting
comprehensive tobacco legislation. Everyone knows the difficulty of putting together legislation
that is so large and complex, but Senator McCain has done so in a way that has been as open and
inclusive as it has been efficient and productive.

         Senator McCain will release his bill later today, and we will need to review it in detail.
But based on what we have heard, I will say this today: We expect to see room for significant
improvement in the McCain bill. Perhaps most important, we want to impose stronger penalties
on companies that continue to sell to our children. And we expect to see some gaps in the
legislation: the McCain bill doesn't try to comprehensively address the question of how best to
use tobacco revenues to protect public health and help our children.

        But we also expect to see a very strong foundation for further action. We believe the bill
will make significant inroads on youth smoking by increasing the price of.a pack of cigarettes
substantially and restricting both the advertising aimed at young people and their access to
tobacco products. And we believe the bill will give the FDA the full authority it needs to
regulate tobacco products. We look forward to working with Senator McCain and others in the
Commerce Committee and the full Senate to strengthen this bill and make it an even more
effective instrument to reduce youth smoking.



Version 2 -- Post-McCain Announcement

         Finally, Senator McCain has provided great leadership in the Commerce Committee to
draft a bipartisan bill that we believe will significantly advance the process of enacting
comprehensive tobacco legislation. Everyone knows the difficulty of putting together legislation
that is so large and complex, but Senator McCain has done so in a way that has been as open and
inclusive as it has been efficient and productive.

        Senator McCain has just released his bill, and we have not yet had a chance to review it in
detail. But based on what we have seen so far, I will say this today: We believe that there is
room for significant improvement in the McCain bill. Perhaps most important, we want to
impose stronger penalties on companies that continue to sell to our children. And we believe
there are gaps in the legislation, as Senator McCain would readily acknowledge: the McCain bill
doesn't comprehensively address the question of how best to use tobacco revenues to protect
public health and help our children.

       But we also believe that this bill provides a very strong foundation for further action. It
will make significant inroads on youth smoking by increasing the price of a pack of cigarettes
substantially and restricting both the advertising aimed at young people and their access to
tobacco products. And it will give the FDA the full authority it needs to regulate tobacco

Committee and the full Senate to strengthen this bill and make it an even more effective
instrument to reduce youth smoking.



Question and Answer on Liability

Question: What is your view of the liability protections for the tobacco industry contained in
Senator McCain's legislation?

Answer: As we have said on many occasions, we would prefer comprehensive tobacco
legislation without liability limits, but in the context ofiegislation that meets all of the
President's principles and dramatically reduces youth smoking, reasonable limits on liability will
not be a dealbreaker. Right now, we're going to focus on the aspects of the McCain legislation
that we think fall short of what the President has demanded: particularly, on the penalties in the
bill to reduce youth smoking. Until we get those right, we won't consider liability protections.

I do want to say, though, that the McCain Bill has a very interesting idea about trying to tum
liability protections into a public health tool. As I understand it, the McCain bill would in some
respects make liability protections contingent on a company's efforts to reduce youth smoking.
That proposal has to be looked at in much greater detail -- we would have to ensure that the
threat of losing liability protections is real, and not just a pretense -- but we believe it is worth
serious consideration.
