             FYI--If we are looking for "good news" or $$ for the POTUS to announce or
             talk about when he's travelling next week, this is a
             possibility.

         You had asked me this morning to check with HRSA to find out when they
         plan to send out the FY 1997 Title II grant awards to States under Ryan
         White.

         HRSA staff advise that they plan to send a "Notice of Grant Award" to each
         State and Territory on March 21st notifying them how much money they will
         receive in FY 1997 from (1) the Regular Title II Formula grant which
         totals $250 million and (2) the $167 million ADAP set-aside.    States will
         then be eligible to start drawing down on these funds on April 1st which
         is the beginning of the FY 1997 grant period.   [You should note however
         that 3 States -- California, Illinois and Florida -- have already received
         up to 25% of their FY 1997 ADAP set-aside award earlier this year during
         the FY 1996 grant period.  You will recall that HHS agreed to make the FY
         1997 ADAP funds available early to States who applied for such funds.]

         HRSA staff also advise that HHS intends to send out a press release on or
         about on March 21st as well announcing this information to the media.

             I will send over to you this afternoon a table that I received from HRSA


.. ,' . r.
    which summarizes how much money each State will receive for both the Title
    II Formula Grant and the ADAP Set-Aside Grant respectively.   Some
    highlights from the table are shown below.    Each State and Territory will
    receive funding under Title II of Ryan White.
