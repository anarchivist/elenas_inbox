TEXT:
I much prefer creating just the advisory board -- not the whole initiative
-- by eo. Only two other questions: (1) can we take out the word crime in
Sec. 2(4)?--I thought that was included in "the administration of
justice."  (2) I'm not keen on the phrase "increasing understanding of the
myriad perceptions of race" --.1 guess I know what this means, but
improving perceptions about perceptions seems a long way from doing real
things, and so could play into criticisms of this initaitive.
