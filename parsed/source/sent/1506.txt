TEXT:
Could we also mention (in the part of the spe'ech that lists the things we
need to make standards work) ways to hold schools accountable -- e.g. by
taking over failing schools and/or transforming them into charters. We
probably should mention here that Rosa Parks is trying to start a charter
school in Detroit.
