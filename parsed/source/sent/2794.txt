Subject: Re: Racial Profiling and Immigration Enforcement



Below from Bob Bach.  The problem is getting them to say what their policy
is. It is hard and unpleasant in either direction, so they want to avoid
letting people know what their policy is. I'm against this on principle.

It is a hard issue. But it is an important issue to a lot of us, especially
the Hispanic advocacy community. I think the President needs to face it.
I'm glad Bach and DOJ are a little ashamed of their unwillingness to
disclaim use of ethnicity as a factor. That's part of my strategy --
pressing to figure out if the enforcement imperative is really worth the
shame and heat. Maybe INS/DOJ should be pushed by someone other than me???


(Someone please forward to Irene Bueno.)

     >Much, much can and should be done to minimize the possibilities of

     >many more and better ways to enforce immigration laws than traffic stops,

     the

     behaviors.

      characteristics

      Mexican or
      >Canadian license plates, etc., and the appearance of the passengers, it
