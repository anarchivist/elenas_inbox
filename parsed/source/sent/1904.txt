TEXT:
I'd try to do it tomorrow even though Rich won't be there.  I don't think
Frank is necessary -- but then again Gene isn't either -- and once you
invite Gene, it's hard not to invite Frank -- and Jack goes to everything
Frank does, doesn't he? -- so I lean toward inviting them both (and
stressing the need for total confidentiality), but I don't feel strongly.
