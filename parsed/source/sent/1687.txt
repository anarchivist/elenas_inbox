TEXT:
george -- your message came through as gobbledygook.  But I completely
agree with your email of last week that DOJ should not be testifying on
the actual terms of the proposed settlement. Anything you guys say should
be framed in terms of general principles that would apply to any tobacco
legislation. And of course we'd like to see testimony framed in that
way. thanks, as always.
