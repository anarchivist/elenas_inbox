TEXT:
Could you and Mary look into this further and see what makes sense? The
POTUS and Erskine both seem to think they're doing great things.  Is there
anything interesting we can announce in the way of policy changes? I'm
going to put in a call to Greg Frazier as well.

in some work with USDA, we've been running into the strong work Glickman
has been doing on race and USDA.    They've put out an interesting report
with 98 recommendations and evidently the POTUS enjoyed their memo on it
very much ... i've got the materials, etc.   but likely i'm old
news ... anyway, they were suggesting a POTUS black famers/rural plural
America event ... happy trails.
