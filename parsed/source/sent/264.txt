        6. Welfare reform and minimum wage

                The AFL will press the Vice President to take a position on whether worker protection
        statutes -- particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) -- apply to welfare recipients
        participating in work activities under the new welfare law. Bruce Reed and Ken Apfel ofOMB
        have been running an interagency process (involving DOL, HHS, USDA, and others) to hammer
        out an answer to this question. The trick is to figure out how to apply the minimum wage law to
        workfare participants without imposing large new costs on states. Bruce and Ken are confident
        that a solution can be worked out that goes a fair way toward satisfying the unions, yet does not
        upset many governors. But they are a few weeks away from presenting this proposed solution to
        you. And everyone seems to agree that if the Vice President announces an Administration
        position favorable to the unions at the Council meeting, both the governors and the Congress
        could react very negatively. There is a danger that such an announcement would make a
        complex and studied welfare implementation decision look like a mere gift to the unions .

               . Proposal: The Vice President should not raise the minimum wage issue at the Council
        meeting. Members of the Vice President should give John Sweeney some private assurances
        that the Administration will soon put out its position and that the key questions -- most notably,
        whether workfare participants count as "employees" for purposes of the minimum wage law--
        will come out his way. When asked about the issue, the Vice President should make a strong
        statement of principle that workers shouldn't be paid a subminimum wage, whether or not they
        come off the welfare rolls. But he should also be careful to note that the Administration is still in
        the process of developing its final positions on the complex issues arising from the intersection
        of the labor laws and welfare law.

               Pro:    This approach will minimize the likelihood of a backlash from governors and/or
                       Congress, by giving the Administration time to refine its position so as to make it
                       more palatable to the states and by issuing the position in a non-political setting.

               Con: This approach will not fully satisfy members of the AFL Council, who would
                    prefer a clear and public statement of the Administration's position at or prior to
                    the Council meeting.

               Recommendation: I recommend that you adopt Bruce and Ken's proposal on how to
        handle this issue.
