TEXT:
I think most of the matters we've been exchanging phone calls about
 (women's health, etc.) have taken care of themselves. The only
outstanding issue is the DOJ response to abortion clinic violence.  FYI:
the DPC and Counsel's Office have jointly asked DOJ to examine its policy
on protection of clinics and report back to us with any proposed changes.
I'll let you know if anything important comes of this process.
