that concludes that the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has no legal authority to prohibit
physicians from prescribing drugs with the intention of hastening death. As you will recall,
Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde had requested that the DEA/Justice determine ifthere was
any Federal authority to address Oregon's assisted suicide law, which permits physicians to
provide medications for the purposes of aiding in an assisted suicide. Consistent with your
instructions, we will release this interpretation, but will also make clear that you maintain your
longstanding position of opposition to assisted suicide and remain open to workable legislative
approaches that address this issue. We expect that Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde will
respond by introducing legislation that provides DEA the explicit authority to press charges
against physicians who assist in suicide. As you know, we believe that a DEA approach is ill-
advised. We will carefully roll out the announcement of your position on this issue with both
Members and interested organizations, such as the Catholic Health Association and the American
Medical Association and will keep you advised of legislative developments.

HCFA Letter to Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago. Last week, 15 year old Christopher
Sercye died of gunshot wounds just 35 feet from Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago, where friends
had brought the young man for help. Hospital workers did not leave their posts and apparently
would not even give police officiers a stretcher to help the young man. In response, the Health
Care Financing Administration sent out a letter to the President of Ravenswood Hospital on
Friday stating that the hospital will lose its Medicare funding on June 19, 1998, unless the facility
takes steps to ensure that the events that led to the tragic death of Christopher Sercye will not be
repeated. You released a statement to highlight the Administration's strong action. In addition,
your statement urges all hospitals to follow the recently released guidance by the American
Hospital Association that advise hospitals to change any policies that prevent taking appropriate
actions in a medical emergency.

Medicare Commission. Next Monday, the Medicare Commission will be holding another
meeting to respond to its Members concerns that they have not had enough time to have intensive
discussions about the major issues ofb~nefits, costs, eligibility, administration, and financing.
Senator Breaux, concerned about the perception of the Commission's irrelevance, has asked
Senators Lott and Daschle to open up the meeting with words of encouragement on the charge
and the potential of this Commission. The Democrats, including our Commission members, are
becoming increasingly nervous that the Commission's staff and Congressman Thomas are
focusing much too heavily on highly speCUlative, numbers-driven policy and much too little time
on how best to reform the Medicare program to respond to the delivery challenges it faces in the
next century. They therefore can be expected to urge the Commission to dedicate as much time
to program design as to program financing. Our members are increasingly seeking answers from
us as to how comfortable we are in allowing them to engage in serious discussions about
controversial policy reforms on benefits (both in requiring higher cost sharing and more benefits
like prescription drug coverage), eligibility age changes, income-related means-testing, and the
possibility of putting new revenues on the table. In general, we believe that at this point it would
be constructive for the Commission to engage in general discussions on all of these issues with
the exception of new revenues. As for revenues, we believe our members should only address
this issue until it becomes clear that traditional saving approaches alone will be insufficient to

Sperling and the NEe to assure we have a coordinate message.

Long Term Care. Long term care is an issue that the aging and disability advocates are
increasingly raising as a major issue that cannot continue to go unaddressed. The demographic
changes in the population make clear that, in the absence of major new breakthroughs in cures
and treatments, there will be an extraordinary increase in demand for services targeted to the
nation's aging and disability population. Because of cost and other limitations, both the public
and private sectors have been slow to develop responses to this challenge. Although
comprehensive solutions are politically and financially unrealistic, we believe that we should
begin a series of targeted policy options to begin to address this problem. These could include,
requiring FEHBP to offer (but not pay for) private long-term care policies, educating Medicare
beneficiaries that Medicare does not cover long term care and advising them of other options,
developing policy options that provide more flexibility to states to provide home and community-
based personal care options for Medicaid elderly and disabled eligibles, and developing possible
tax incentive approaches that could potentially increase the purchase of private long-term care
policies. We believe that you may want to move in this area relatively soon and capture at least
part of an issue that has extraordinary political and policy dimensions.
