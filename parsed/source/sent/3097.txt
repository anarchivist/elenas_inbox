TEXT:
FYI: The Justice Dept,   at a meeting yesterday, decided to join Sierra Club etc.
in asking the court in   the Seattle Audobon case to reaffirm the injunction (thus
preventing the release   of sales).  BLM and FWS had recommended this position;
the Forest Service had   indicated that it didn't much care.
