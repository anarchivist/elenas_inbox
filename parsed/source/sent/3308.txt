I am sending the product liability talking points. Trey Schrader handles
medical malpractice for our office; I'd check with him for talking points on
that subject. As for tort reform generally, perhaps Bruce Lindsey?, but I
suspect we don't have any.

TALKING POINTS ON PRODUCT LIABILITY BILL
The President will veto H.R. 956 because it intrudes on the
traditional prerogatives of the states and unfairly tilts the
legal playing field against consumers.
?        The Administration supports products liability reform at the
federal level.    Any legislation, however, must respect the
important role of the states in our federal system and must
fairly balance the interests of consumers with those of
manufacturers and sellers. Congress could have passed
legislation, appropriately limited in scope and balanced in
application, meeting these tests.    The President would have
been glad to sign such a bill. But this bill unfairly
burdens consumers and unduly infringes on the States.
?        The bill displaces many rules of state tort law      and does
so in a way that peculiarly disadvantages consumers.    As a
rule, the bill displaces state law only when that law is
more favorable to consumers; it allows· state law to remain
in effect when that law is more helpful to manufacturers and
sellers.   It is a one
o
-way street of federalism.
In particular, the President opposes the elimination of joint
liability for noneconomic damages (such as pain and suffering)and
the caps on punitive damages.
The elimination of joint liability for noneconomic damages would
prevent many injured victims of defective products from receiving
the full measure of their damages.
?       This provision would leave the innocent victim to suffer
when one wrongdoer, in any case with multiple wrongdoers,
goes bankrupt.  Under traditional state law, if one
wrongdoer goes bankrupt, the other wrongdoers pick up the
tab. This bill relieves the other wrongdoers of this
obligation for any noneconomic damages.  The innocent victim
has to bear this part of the loss on his own.
?       This is of real significance because companies sued for
manufacturing or selling defective products stand a higher
than usual chance of going bankrupt; consider manufacturers
of asbestos, breast implants or intra


o
-uterine devices.
?       This provision is all the more troubling because it
disproportionately affects the most vulnerable members of
society -- the elderly, the poor, and nonworking women.
This is because the provision applies only to noneconomic
damages, thus cutting most deeply into the damage awards of
victims who do not have large amounts of lost income.


capping punitive damages would encourage companies to engage in
egregious misconduct, such as knowingly manufacturing and selling
harmful products, and thereby endanger the safety of consumers.
?        The cap invites potential defendants, deciding whether to
manufacture or sell a clearly defective product, simply to
weigh the costs of wrongdoing against the potential profits.
Punitive awards deter such intentional misconduct by making
deliberate wrongdoers pay more than the harm they cause.
?        The provision allowing judges to exceed the cap in certain
circumstances does not cure the problem, given the intent of
Congress, expressed in the Statement of Managers, that "the
occasions for additional awards will be very limited."
The President also objects to Congress's failure to exempt
negligent suppliers from the provision of the bill limiting
lawsuits against suppliers of materials used in devices implanted
in the body. A supplier of materials who knew or should have
known that the materials, as implanted, would cause injury should
not receive any protection from suit.
Finally, the President opposes certain provisions snuck into the
Conference Report that expand the scope of the bill and
exacerbate its harmful consequences.
?       The Conference Report, unlike the Senate version, makes the
limitations on noneconomic and punitive damages applicable
to negligent entrustment cases -- cases in which, for
example, an injured person sues a gun dealer who knowingly
sold a gun to a convicted felon or a bar owner who sold a
drink to an obviously inebriated customer.
?       The Conference Report, unlike the Senate version, would
prevent some injured persons from bringing suit against
companies that are being reorganized in a bankruptcy court.
It does this by eliminating a provision that stopped the
statute of limitations from running when a bankruptcy court
issues an automatic stay preventing lawsuits from being
brought during bankruptcy proceedings.
