Mike -- could you write me up a paragraph for the weekly on the Calif
event along the lines of what Christa has suggested, putting in whatever
you think he should know we're doing? Many thanks.

I've thought about what I could say, and I don't know how I should
contribute to the weekly report.   I'm afraid that anything I have to offer
is going to be/and should be covered .by the policy person.  For example,
these are they types of things I could write in a weekly this week:
We had 3 successful health care events - Jennings
We are working w/ the VP's off. on the FCC announcement for Tues.
-Burke/Elena
We are preparing for a major endorsement from the state of CA endorsing
our
standards and testing proposals on Wednesay. We are planning to have a
roundtable discussion where you receive the endorsement of CA. Schools
Superintendent and from California high tech CEO's for national
standards.   150 people will be invited, including educators and busness
representatives from California and from national associations. (Cohen)
We have submitted a commencement strategy that includes a teachers
college, a turnaround school, an urban high school, and an America Reads
college that has direct lending.
We are working on policy announcements for Kick Butts day on the 15th and
for the Early Learning Conference. We are also working on annoucnements
associated with the service summit that highlight Americorps and
encouraging youth to participate in service.

What do you think I should do? Should I just send these to you so you can
check to make sure they are covered by other staff? Please advise.
