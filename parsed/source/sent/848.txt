No problem.  This looks right, but check with Diana. Also, ask Diana
and/or Ken whether they think we need all the other agency people in a
meeting devoted to fica/eitc.  My sense is that we do, but I wish we
didn't. Many thanks.

I told Janet Yellin that I would work hard to make sure that the First
Lady mentioned the CEA white paper some time during the day.  Nothing more
than a single sentence is necessary -- something to the effect that the
cea is releasing a report today demonstrating the returns from investing
in young children.   Is that OK with everyone? Let me know if it's a
problem. Thanks.
