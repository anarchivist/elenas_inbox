     1. I will edit the graphs on the Compact to make clear that you're
     talking about a challenge grant rather than a block grant.   I have
     circulated the new chapter to Bruce, Elena and Mike, but my guess is that
     they will still be concerned about the "undermining" point and still
     believe that our ESEA proposals aren't prominent enough.   Assuming that's
     the case, I will leave in a slightly modified version of the Compact
     graphs (fixing "challenge," the funding stream point, etc.)

     2. On social promotion, I think you're right and that this point in my
     memo should probabaly come out.

     3. On high standards, I think the draft creates some ambiguity and that
     this is likely what DPC has reacted to.  Indeed, when I first read your
     section on resource equity, I wasn't entirely sure whether you intended
     the use of standards and tests to be contingent on some greater equalizing
     of resources.  I get it now, but I wasn't sure when I first read the text.

     The embrace of standards in the draft seems grudging. To begin with, it
     is folded into the section on resource inequities rather than being put in
     its more natural place, in the "High Expectations and Accountability."
     Second, the tone is -- "standards and tests can be important but don't
     forget about inequality in resources" -- rather than a fuller, warmer
     embrace of the standards movement and why the President thinks it's so
     important, followed by a strong statement about what we need to do to
     promote greater resource equity.

     I actually think this sort of thing ought to be fixable without presenting
     the issue to the President, but so far you and Terry have been reluctant
     to make the change. So that's where we are.

     4. I think your puzzlement on the economic point is entirely fair.    The
     problem is that I have been trying to convey something without having
     anything in writing. Why don't we say that I'll delete this graph if I
   don't get anything in writing from NEC.  If I do get something, I'll put
   in a clearer paragraph or not, as their submission dictates.

   5. On racial profiling, I'll edit to indicate your preference for a flat
   ban. Let me include here the text of an email from Chuck that you might
   not have seen:

   "Having spent a few days trying to draft an appropriate introduction to
   the Executive Order, I discussed with Maria on Friday what I hope will be
   the solution to the problem. Early in the week, Eric Holder is meeting
   with INS to determine whether there is any real need for the "INS
   exception" to an absolute ban on racial profling. Assuming that the
   answer is "no," we should then be able to stake out for the President the
   same firm position already publicly adopted by the Vice President and the
   Attorney General."

   Am I right that you would oppose a data collection EO even with a firm
   opening statement similar to the VP's? Or would such a statement at the
   opening of a data collection order resolve the matter for you? I assume
   it wouldn't, but I want to check before indicating to the President that
   there is still a dispute.

   Of course, I will circulate a new draft of the memo as soon as I have one
   ready. Thanks for your continuing effort on this.   tds
