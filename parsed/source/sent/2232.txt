     I agree with the recommendation.   Let's pull the plug.

     Subject:         Self-assessment guide

             We met with the civil rights groups this morning to discuss the
     draft guide on affirmative action for higher education. Representatives
     of DOJ and OCR were there as well.
             There have always been some underlying difficulties in drafting
     this document. Unlike other areas, e.g., benchmarking, federal hiring, and
     DOT rulemaking, this has not been an exercise in our "mending" our own
     affirmative action policies. Instead, the idea has been to state the law
     as it now stands in order to provide guidance to universities.
              However, as the groups argued, it is impossible to state the law
     clearly and completely, given that there are so many unanswered questions.
     The more specific the document, the more we have to put our own
     interpretation on the Court's cryptic statements in this area, and the
     more we make it difficult for others to argue their interpretations. On
     the other hand, if we issue a highly general statement, the document is
     not really useful, and it certainly does not provide a "mend it, don't end
     it" message.
             As a result, there is a consensus among White House and agency
     staff that, for the time being at least, we should abandon the effort to
    issue a document that purports to set out the law of affirmative action in
    this area. We should continue doing what we have already been doing, which
    is providing technical assistance to universities at conferences and in
    other informal settings. This decision was somewhat painful given that DOJ
    and OCR staff have spent hundreds of hours in drafting. However, they
    agree with this approach, too. In addition, we believe that we should look
    for an opportunity to get out this basic message: the administration
    believes that affirmative action in higher education is constitutional and
    strongly supports it. That message can be conveyed in other ways, for
    example, in a statement by the POTUS this fall.
            Consequently, our advice is not to issue this document and to tell
    the civil rights groups informally of our decision. I will wait to hear
    from you before I contact them.
