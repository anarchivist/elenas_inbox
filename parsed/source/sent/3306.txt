TEXT:
Didn't you tell me that the program people say the lawyers are dealing with
these issues? Well, the lawyers say the program people are dealing with them.
I told Anna Durand that based on today's meeting, the program people have
agreed (as has the Secretary).  Durand reiterated that there would be
essentially no enforcement mechanism for the 24-month requirement.  She also
said that there were many critical details yet to be worked out on the paternity
regulation.  I suggested that sooner, rather than later was the appropriate
timeframe.  She said that she understood -- and that she'd talk to the program
people!
