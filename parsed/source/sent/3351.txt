TEXT:
Lois Schiffer just called to say that USDA has reached an agreement in principle
with the purchaser of Warner Creek.  The settlement involves not only Warner
Creek but a number of other outstanding claims. The lawyers for USDA and the
purchaser are currently writing up the agreement.  It will then be submitted to
DOJ (civil and environmental divisions) for approval.
