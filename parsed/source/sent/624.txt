CREATOR: Elena Kagan ( CN=Elena Kagan/OU=OPD/O=EOP       OPD 1 )

CREATION DATE/TIME:14-MAR-1997 13:40:05.00

SUBJECT:   Re: giuliani meeting

TO: Bruce N. Reed ( CN=Bruce N. Reed/OU=OPD/O=EOP [ OPD 1 )
READ:UNKNOWN

TEXT:
He wants a meeting on immigrants and welfare-to-work.      Are you saying only
the former and not the latter?

On another subject:  I was just going through some old papers and happened
on an article the President sent to you and Rahm entitled "Can't Anyone
Here Speak English?" I can't read the note he wrote to you, but the
article has obvious relevance if we do an ebonics/english only speech.
