                        RESUL TS IN EDUCATION


       In his State ofthe Union Address, President Clinton will announce a package of
accountability measures designed to hold students, teachers, and schools to high standards, and to
ensure that school districts and states provide students with a high quality education. These
proposals will help to lift student achievement in every public school and close the opportunity
gap by giving special attention to disadvantaged students in low-performing schools.

       The President's plan marks a sea change in national education policy -- for the first time
holding states and school districts accountable for progress and rewarding them for results.
While insisting that states and local governments retain primary responsibility for education,
President Clinton will call on Congress to make sure federal dollars support what works and not
what doesn't. His proposal emphasizes reforms that a growing number of states, cities, and
schools across the nation are implementing and that are producing clear results.

         Specifically, the President will announce that he will send Congress legislation to
reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that schools end social
promotion; teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned; states tum around their
lowest-performing schools; parents get annual report cards on school performance; and schools
institute effective discipline policies.

End Social Promotion. The President's proposal will require states and school districts to end
social promotion -- the practice of promoting students from grade to grade regardless of whether
they have mastered the appropriate material and are academically prepared to do the work at the
next level. Students who are promoted without regard to their achievement fall even further
behind their classmates, and are more likely to lack basic skills upon graduating from high
school.

To ensure that this requirement helps more students succeed, rather than simply increasing the
number held back, states and school districts would have to show how they will help students
meet promotion standards on time by (1) strengthening learning opportunities in the classroom·
with clear standards, small classes with well-prepared teachers, high quality professional
development, and use of proven instructional practices; (2) identifying students who need help at
the earliest possible moment; (3) providing extended learning time, including after-school and
summer school for students who need extra help; and (4) developing an effective remedial plan,
with intensive intervention, for students who still do not meet the standards, so they can get back
on track in their schooling.

In 1996 President Clinton challenged every state and school district to adopt policies to end
social promotion and require students to pass high school graduation exams. Twenty six
states now have high school exit exams, and last year four states adopted policies to stop
promoting unprepared students from grade to grade. A growing number of urban school
districts, including Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington D.C. are



                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
promotion in a way that gives students who need it substantial extended learning time,
citywide math and reading scores have gone up every year, with the largest gains among
the most disadvantaged students. President Clinton's FY 2000 budget proposes to triple
federal funding for after-school and summer school programs (from $200 million to $600
million) to help schools ending social promotion give students the extra help they need to
succeed.

Put Qualified Teachers in the Classroom. According to the National Commission on
Teaching and America's Future, one of the most important factors in improving student
achievement is the knowledge and skills teachers bring to the classroom. Yet every year,
approximately 50,000 individuals teach on "emergency" certificates, which means they do not
meet the standards the state has set for certification. In addition, numerous teachers teach
subjects for which they lack adequate preparation, with fully one quarter of secondary school
teachers lacking even a minor in their main teaching field. Students in schools with the highest
concentrations of poverty -- those who often need the most help from the best teachers -- are
most likely to be in classrooms with teachers who are not fully qualified: for example, in schools
with the highest minority enrollment, students have a less than 50 percent chance of having a
math or science teacher with a license and degree in the field.

The President's proposal will require states to adopt performance examinations for all new
teachers, requiring them to demonstrate both subject-matter knowledge and teaching expertise.
The proposal also will require states and school districts to phase out, over five years, the use of
teachers with emergency certificates and the practice of assigning teachers to subjects for which
they lack adequate preparation. To support these new teacher quality standards, the proposal will
provide resources to help states strengthen teacher certification standards, test new teachers,
provide training to current teachers, and give incentives to recruit more highly qualified teachers.

Turn Around Low Performing Schools. The President's proposal will require states to
identify the schools with the lowest achievement levels and least improvement and take
corrective action to tum them around. These corrective actions, based on a careful assessment of
each school's needs, would include steps such as intensive teacher training, support to improve
school discipline, and the implementation of proven approaches to school reform. If these
actions do not result in improved student achievement within two years, the proposal would
require states to take additional corrective actions, such as permitting students to attend other
public schools; reconstituting the school, by fairly evaluating the staff and making staff changes
as appropriate; or closing the school and reopening it as a charter school or with an entirely new
staff. Nineteen states currently take similar actions to help improve low-performing schools, and
experience demonstrates that when these interventions carefully implemented and accompanied
by the resources to support change, schools improve and student achievement increases. The
President's FY 2000 budget contains $200 million to help states begin taking these steps
immediately.

Issue School Report Cards. The President's proposal will require states to distribute to all
parents annual report cards for each school and school district, as well as the state as a whole.



                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion

       The report cards will include information on student achiev~ment, teacher professional
       qualifications, class size, school safety, and other factors that will help parents to judge the
       performance of the schools. Where appropriate, the report cards also will show the academic
       achievement of ethnic and racial subgroups, to ensure accountability for helping all students
       achieve. Thirty-six states currently publish or require local school districts to publish school
       report cards, and five additional states will begin the practice in the next two years. A recent
       report by Public Agenda, however, shows that only 31 percent of parents had seen these report
       cards. The President's proposal will help ensure that all parents in all states have access to the
       information they need to evaluate the quality of their schools and identify the areas in which
       improvement is needed.

       Adopt Discipline Policies. Schools must be a place of learning. President Clinton already has
       challenged states, communities, and schools to take a number of steps to restore order and safety,
       such as adopting school uniforms, enforcing truancy laws, and imposing curfews. But in some
       schools, the breakdown of classroom discipline remains one of the biggest obstacles to learning
       and one of the greatest concerns for teachers, students, and parents alike. The President's
       proposal will require states and school districts to adopt discipline policies to make sure students
       have the chance to learn and teachers have the chance to teach.

                           Talking Points on New York Times Education Article

    ·         The New York Times headline writer got the President's proposal wrong. The President
              isn't going to be proposing a national superintendent of education. He is going to be
              proposing significant education reforms to promote accountability for results in public
              schools across the nation.

    ·         The President believes that states and localities should continue to have primary.
              responsibility for education and should have flexibility to decide what to teach and how
              to teach it.

    ·        But the President also believes that we should hold schools accountable for results. For
             our children's sake, we should invest in what works and not in what doesn't. We should
             put into place the accountability measures that study after study shows produce results
             and increase student achievement.

    ·         Here's what we're saying:
                      -- Schools should end social promotion -- the practice of moving children from
                grade to grade regardless whether they've learned the subject;
                      -- Teachers should be qualified to teach the subjects they are assigned to teach,
                and new teachers should have to pass performance and subject matter tests to
        show they can do so;
                     -- States have a responsibility to tum around their lowest-performing schools
                through intensive intervention, and if necessary by making significant staff
        changes and/or closing the school and reopening it as a charter school;
                     -- Parents should get annual report cards for every school and school district so
                they can see how well the schools are working and be able to make informed
        choices; and
                     -- Schools should institute strict discipline codes so that they can be places of
                learning.

    ·        A growing number of states, cities, and schools are implementing these reforms. They
             are, almost without exception, the places making the biggest student achievement gains.
             The President wants to ensure that all our children reap the rewards of these
             accountability measures.

    ·        The President is determined to stand for these common-sense principles -- to demand
             accountability and to make sure that taxpayers' money is used wisely and well, rather
             than to subsidize educational failure. He believes these principles will benefit our
             children. And he will be glad to debate anyone who thinks that they are the wrong
             principles for a 21 st century American education.
