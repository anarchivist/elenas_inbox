                                           May 20,1997


 The Welfare to Work PartnershiD
                               ·
        Today President Clinton announced that over 100 companies have accepted his State of
the Union challenge to forge "a new national effort to marshal America's businesses, large and
small, to create jobs so that people can move from welfare to work.)) CEOs and senior
executives from the companies joined the President to launch the Welfare to Work Partnership, a
private, non-profit organization which will lead the national business effort to hire people from
the welfare rolls. The Partnership pledged to enlist 1,000 companies within the next six months
and named United Airlines Corporation CEO Gerald Greenwald its Chairman of the Board.

         The Welfare to Work Partnership is an independent, nonpartisan, national effort of the
 American business community to help move those on public assistance into jobs in the private
 sector. The Partnership will provide information, technical assistance, and support for all
 interested companies. The Partnership was formed in response to the President's challenge in his
'1997 State of the Union speech, and the CEOs from the five companies the President noted in
 that speech -- Sprint, Monsanto, UPS, Burger King, and United Airlines -- form the
 Partnership's Board of Directors. Since signing the welfare law last August, the President has
 launched an aggressive campaign to challenge both the public and private sector to help welfare
 reform succeed. The President signaled his commitment to work with the corporate community
 by holding a White House meeting with 14 company CEOs in January 1997. After that meeting
 five companies made a commitment to lead a national welfare to work effort.

The President's Welfare to Work Transportation Initiative
        Citing transportation as one of the biggest barriers in moving from welfare to work,
President Clinton today announced grants to 24 states to develop strategies to solve this problem.
 The President urged Congress to enact his $600 million welfare to work transportation initiative,
part of his NEXTEA transportation proposal.

        Two-thirds of new jobs are in the suburbs, but three of four welfare recipients live in
rural areas or central cities. Only six percent of welfare recipients own cars, and public transit
often provides inadequate connections to job and training centers. To combat this problem, the
President today urged Congress to adopt the six-year, $600 million grant program in his
NEXTEA transportation bill that would support flexible, innovative transportation systems in
rural, urban, and suburban areas to get people where the jobs are. Today, the President also
announced grants to 24 states and the Virgin Islands to develop welfare to work transportation
plans. The grants are being awarded by the Department of Transportation's Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Highway Administration in cooperation with the National
Governors' Association.

A Balanced Budget that Helps Move People {[om Welfare to Work
       The President praised the new budget agreement which includes two critical welfare to
work initiatives. The first is a $3 billion Welfare to Work fund for cities and states to create job
opportunities for welfare recipients. This proposal, a centerpiece of the President's second-term
agenda, will help move one million adults from welfare to work. The budget agreement also
                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion


           includes the President's proposed enhanced tax credit which would give companies that hire
           long-term welfare recipients a 50 tax credit on the first $10,000 of wages paid over two years.




                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion



     Vice Presidential Initiatives
             To ensure that former welfare recipients succeed in the workplace, Vice President Gore
     today announced a new campaign, beginning with a conference on May 29th, to help those
     leaving welfare retain jobs.

              In addition to this new campaign, the Vice President is overseeing the federal
     government's hiring initiative. The President has committed the federal government, the nation's
     largest employer, to do its part to hire people from the welfare rolls. On April 10th the President
     held the first full Cabinet meeting of his second term in which federal agencies pledged to directly
     hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients over the next four years.

     rodar's ProfJram
            The President was joined today by the Vice President, Mr. Greenwald, Partnership
     President Eli J. Segal, Delaware Governor Tom Carper, Wisconsin Governor Tommy
     Thompson, and small business owner George R. Stinson of Racine, Wisconsin, whose company
     workforce is more than half former welfare recipients.

                                          Welfare to Work
                                           May 20,1997
                                               Q&A

     Company Hiring

     Question:    How many companies have committed to hire welfare recipients?

     Answer:      Today, over 100 companies committed to hire people from the welfare rolls --
                  and the Partnership's new Chairman, Gerald Greenwald today pledged to sign up
                  1,000 companies within six months.

     Question:    How many employees have they promised to hire?

     Answer:     Companies weren't asked to make specific commitments, but many have anyway.
                 For example, United Airlines has pledged to hire 2,000 people on welfare by the
                 end of the year 2000. Cessna currently employs 150 welfare recipients and plans
                 to hire 50 more.

     Question:    Will these companies displace other workers in order to hire welfare recipients?

     Answer:     No. An explicit part of the commitment each company has made is to hire and
                 retain former welfare recipients without displacing other workers.

     Question:   Will the companies pay health benefits?

     Answer:     We expect companies to treat former welfare recipients like any other
                 workers, which includes providing health benefits if they are provided to other
                 workers.

     Welfare to Work Partnership

     Question:   What is the Welfare to Work Partnership?

     Answer:     The Partnership is a national, independent, nonpartisan effort of the business
                         community to help move people on public assistance to jobs in the
                 private sector. The Partnership will concentrate on energizing the business
                 community to hire and retain welfare recipients without displacement of
                 existing workers.

                 The Partnership provides information, technical assistance and support for
                 businesses of all sizes, from all industries and from all areas of the country.




                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump COllvel'5ion




     Question:    What are the goals of the Partnership?

     Answer:      In the first year, the Partnership plans to build an expanding network of
                  companies committed to hiring and retaining persons on public assistance. In
                  addition to mobilizing companies, the Partnership will publish and broadly
                  disseminate a best practices manual of private sector initiatives and promising
                  pUblic-private alliances at the state and local levels. It expects to develop a
                  comprehensive, customer-friendly database of organizations which provide job
                  training and readiness, child care and related services.

     Question:   Who are the five founding corporations?

     Answer:     The founding companies of the Partnership are United Airlines, Burger King,
                 Monsanto Company, Sprint Corporation, and United Parcel Services of
                 America. United Airlines CEO Gerald Greenwald is the chairman ofthe board.

     Question:   Who can participate in the Partnership?

     Answer:     Membership is open to all businesses, large or small, who are committed to
                 either hiring and retaining those on public assistance without displacing existing
                 workers.

     Question:   Why should businesses get involved with the Partnership or any other type
                 of welfare reform effort?

     Answer:     Because it makes good business sense. Today many companies find it difficult to
                 locate entry-level workers. By actively recruiting welfare recipients, companies
                 will greatly enlarge their pool of potential entry-level workers, a pool of workers
                 that companies have previously not actively recruited. In addition, companies
                 will have the knowledge that they are actively participating in their communities
                 to strengthen families and improve children's lives.

     Today's Speakers

     Question:   Why was Governor Thompson invited to speak?

     Answer:     We invited two governors to speak today -- Governor Tommy Thompson (R-
                 Wise.) and Governor Tom Carper (D-Del.). Both were intimately involved in
                 developing the welfare reform proposals the President signed into law, and both have
                 been welfare reform leaders in their own states -- so it seemed appropriate to have
                 them here today. In addition, today the President announced transportation planning
                 grants to 24 states, which were given in cooperation with the National Governors'
                 Association.




                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Answer:     George R. Stinson is the President and owner of General Converters and
            Assemblers, Inc. in Racine, Wisconsin. More than half his workforce is former
            welfare recipients. He is currently expanding his plant and plans to fill many of the
            100 new positions with welfare recipients. An African American, Stinson says that
            one of his primary concerns as an employer is to hire and provide on-the-job training
            to persons without much job experience.

Transportation Announcement

Question:   Why is the President talking about new transportation funding now, after the
            budget has been agreed to?

Answer:     With the budget agreement in place, the Congressional Committees are about
            to take up the IS TEA reauthorization -- so now is exactly the right time for the
            President to highlight the welfare to work provisions of the transportation bill he sent
            to the Hill earlier this spring. Also, many of the business leaders involved in the
            Welfare to Work Partnership have told us how important transportation will be to
            their ability to hire welfare recipients, so today's event seemed like a good time to
            discuss the President's welfare to work transportation proposal.

            In general, the budget negotiations assume the reauthorization of ISTEA,
            although the level of transportation spending within the domestic discretionary
            category has been under some discussion recently. But the budget agreement
            certainly leaves room for the President's $600 million welfare to work transportation
            proposal.

Question:   What does the President's transportation proposal do?

Answer:     The President's NEXTEA transportation bill:

            ·      Invests $600 Million to Improve Access to Jobs and Training. NEXTEA
                   includes a six-year, $600 million grant program to support innovative
                   transportation initiatives, such as vanpools, to get people where the jobs are.

            ·      Increases Job Training Opportunities in Transportation Technology and
                   Construction. NEXTEA opens opportunities in transportation by increasing
                   incentives for states and localities to provide job training in conjunction with
                   federally-funding technology and construction projects and enabling them to
                   offer hiring preferences favoring welfare recipients and residents of
                   Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities.




                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-DUllIp Conversion




     Question:   What can the $600 million be used for?

     Answer:     States, local governments, and private, non-profit organizations could
                 apply for grants to plan and implement new transportation services targeted at linking
                 welfare recipients with jobs.

     Question:   Would the proposal allow welfare recipients to be hired at the expense of
                 other workers?

     Answer:     No. What the President's bill does allow is what are called "local hiring
                 preferences" allowing transportation contractors to provide a preference to equally
                 qualified welfare recipients and residents of Enterprise Zones and Enterprise
                 Communities who apply for construction and related jobs.

     Question:   The grants the President announced today seem pretty small. Do you expect
                 them to accomplish anything?

     Answer:     These grants, provided by the Department of Transportation in cooperation
                 with the National Governors' Association, will enable states and communities to
                 develop strategies that support welfare to work efforts. They will bring state and
                 local welfare, training, and transportation authorities together to address this problem
                 in a strategic way. But these are just seed grants for developing plans -- that's why
                 the President has proposed a comprehensive, $600 million fund for welfare to work
                 transportation services.

     White House Hiring

     Question:   More than a month ago, the White House pledged to hire welfare recipients?
                 Have any been hired?

     Answer:     Yes, one former welfare recipient has already been hired, and the departments
                 are reviewing resumes to fill the remaining positions.

     Minimum Wage

     Question:   Will the Administration's announcement last week that employers must pay
                 welfare recipients the minimum wage make it harder for companies to hire welfare
                 recipients?

     Answer:     No. Private companies have always had to pay the minimum wage and
                 follow the Fair Labor Standards Act for those workers who are "employees" instead
                 of "trainees." The confusion lay primarily in whether the law required govemment-
                 sponsored workfare to pay the minimum wage. Our lawyers believe that most
                 welfare recipients participating in the work activities such as workfare will legally
                 count as "employees."


                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-DUJllp Conversion
              for states?

Answer:      Not at all. With both T ANF and food stamps counting toward the minimum
             wage, every state except Mississippi will be able to give welfare recipients workfare
             slots for 20 hours a week (the welfare law's current requirement) without raising their
             benefit levels. And of course states should be trying to place welfare recipients in
             private sector jobs where the minimum wage already applies -- that'swhy having so
             many companies commit today to hiring welfare recipients is so important.

Question:    Will the Administration support changes to the welfare law so workfare
             programs don't have to pay the minimum wage?

Answer:      We would oppose legislation that flatly exempts welfare recipients from the
             minimum wage law. The Administration believes that people who work should be
             paid at least the minimum wage.

Question:    Would you oppose any legislation addressing this issue?

Answer:      Not necessarily, but any legislation would have to be consistent with our support for
             the minimum wage. In determining how the minimum wage applies to workfare, the
             Administration has had to address a host of technical issues that Congress did not
             deal with in passing the welfare law. If Congress wants to address these issues, the
             Administration will consider the proposals carefully. But any legislation must reflect
             the Administration's position that people who work should be paid at least the
             minImum wage.

Welfare Privatization

Question:    I understand Erskine Bowles and other White House officials plan to meet
             with members of the Texas Congressional delegation this week. Is this the beginning
             of a negotiation over welfare privatization?

Answer:      No, we are not taking part in any negotiation. The purpose of the meetings
             is simply to answer any questions the Congressional delegation may have regarding
             the response that the Administration provided to the state of Texas last week
             regarding what kinds of privatization is allowed under current law.

Question:    Is the Administration going to approve Wisconsin's request to privatize
             welfare and food stamp offices in some parts of the state?

Answer:      We have not yet responded to Wisconsin's request.

     Vice Presidential Announcement

     Question:   The Vice President announced he'll chair a conference on May 29th.
                 What's the subject?

     Answer:     The conference will focus on job retention strategies and will include a panel
                 of groups that have helped fonner welfare recipients become successful workers.

     Question:   What's the purpose of the conference?

     Answer:     The Vice President and his staff have been meeting with a wide range of civic
                 organizations to discuss their role in welfare refonn. Of course, many of these
                 groups have been contributing to their communities for more than a century, so
                 public service is nothing new to them.

     Question:   Is there any particular model the Vice President favors?

     Answer:     The panelists are from a variety of types of programs -- nonprofits, like the
                 Strive program in New York which was recently featured on 60 Minutes; America
                 Works, the successful, private sector job placement and retention company; and
                 public sector, such as the Social Security Administration, which has a long record of
                 successfully hiring welfare recipients. The Vice President is particularly intrigued by
                 what State Comptroller John Sharp has done in Texas. The Texas Pathfinders project
                 has paired welfare recipients with community mentors to help them make the
                 transition to self-sufficiency.
