Subject:         Panelists for NH

I have been hearing conflicting things, and wanted to clarify with you
both about our panelists for the healthcare roundtable tomorrow.  So far
we are looking to go with ..

Small business person
Part-time worker on Medicaid with a disability who would like to work
full-time
Long-term care provider
CHIPs story

We were also initially looking for a PBOR person, but I'm hearing that
people agreed not to go with this panelist.  Is this true? Do we just
want the above 4 panelists?
