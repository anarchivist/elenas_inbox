        MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES

        SUBJECT:               Federal Policies Targeted to Children in Their Earliest Years



        Over the past few years, scientific research has demonstrated that the earliest years of life --
        before children reach school-age -- are critical to cognitive and emotional development. We
        know that emotional nourishment, good nutrition, proper health care, intellectual stimulation and
        parental and community support during the first years oflife form the foundation for a child's
        ability to learn, thrive in school, work productively and contribute fully to society.

        Across the federal government, we are making great strides to enhance development during the
        earliest years of life, before a child reaches school, by investing in research, educating parents
        and caregivers, and supporting programs that provide early intervention to disadvantaged
        families. I am committed to accelerating our efforts to target the earliest years oflife. We all
        have a stake in ensuring tha~ every child is given the opportunity to fulfill his or her God-given
        potential.

        Today, I am directing the heads of executive departments and agencies to report to me in thirty
        days with:

        1.       a comprehensive list and assessment of existing projects and programs that target the
        earliest years oflife -- including any qualitative or quanitative evidence of success, as well as
        current funding level and number of clients served -- and a description of proposed
        improvements, if any are needed, to such projects and programs;

        2.       a comprehensive list and assessment of planned projects and programs that target the
        earliest years oflife, including projected funding levels and number of clients to be served; and

        3.       specific proposals of additional projects and programs that could be undertaken to target
        the earliest years of life, including an estimate of the new funding, if any, these proposals would
        reqUIre.

        I am also directing the establishment of a senior level interagency working group to share,
        examine, and develop these assessments and plans.




                                                                                                   ds ~etnent System
                                                                                  Automated Recc>f

           MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS

           FROM:          BRUCE REED
                          Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

                          ELENA KAGAN
                          Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

           SUBJECT:       Fonnation ofInteragency Working Group on Early Childhood Development


                   As the President announced in his State of the Union Address, he and the First Lady will
           hold a White House Conference on Early Learning and the Brain this Spring. In conjunction
           with this Conference, and in light of recent scientific research on neurological development, the
           Administration will engage in a broad-based review of policy affecting our youngest children.
           As this review goes forward, the Administration will highlight ongoing and new initiatives to
           support these children and their families.

                   To initiate this effort, the President will issue an executive memorandum asking each
           agency to identify policies and proposals to enhance early childhood development. This
           memorandum also will call for the fonnation of a senior level interagency working group to
           share, examine, and develop these plans. Attached is a draft of this memorandum.

                   We will hold the first meeting of this working group on Friday, February 14, from 1:30-
           2:30 p.m. in Room 472 of the Old Executive Office Building. We would like you to designate a
           Presidential appointee to join this working group and attend this meeting. Because the President
           wishes to issue the executive memorandum shortly after this meeting, your designee should
           provide any comments you have on the memorandum before or at the meeting. In addition,
           designees should bring with them a list of the three to five programs or initiatives relating to
           early childhood development that your agency, at this early stage in the process, would most like
           to highlight. Given the Administration's commitment to a balanced budget and fiscal discipline,
           each agency should indicate the level of new funding, if any, these initiatives would require.

                  Please feel free to contact either of us with any questions.
