Subject:         Race Initiave--Presidential Meeting in January with Civil Rights
leaders

As part of our ongoing dialogue, we will be scheduling a meeting with
civil rights leaders with the President sometime in January.  Some of you
may recall that we gathered a group of about 24 people before the San
Diego speech in June--one of the most interesting conversations.  While we
do not want this next meeting to be viewed as tied directly to the meeting
with conservatives later this month, we should get closure on the invite
list so we can tell some of our friends that we're listening to many differ
ent perspectives. Below is a first cut at a list, based in part on that
meeting in June, and is submitted to spur your thoughts.  Comments and
suggestions by 3:00 pm Thurs.

Antonia Hernandez (MALDEF)              Rev. Lowery                 Dr.

Please react, prioritize and otherwise tell us what you think?      Thanks.
