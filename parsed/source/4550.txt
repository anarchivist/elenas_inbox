       Barbara Chow requested I forward to you the attached Q/A and spreadsheet.



       Notes:
       No COLA increases in the out years on the cost of a new teacher.
       LEAs with poverty levels below 50% provide 35% of all funding over $1,2
       billion. LEAs with poverty levels above 50% are exempt from the match.
       The seven year total is $12.6 billion. The seven year total in the
       Administration's original proposal was $12.4 billion. The difference is
       caused by the fact that both the FY 1999 appropriation and the FY 2000
       Budget exceed the original funding path by $100 million. As such, when
       compared to the original proposal, the Budget can be thought of as ahead
       of schedule toward reaching 100,000 teachers.

         Question:     The President has repeatedly stated his goal of reducing class size in the early
                grades by helping schools hire 100,000 teachers by 2005. Does this budget support
                funding levels in the outyears to meet that goal?

         Answer:         Yes. The President remains fully committed, as his FY 2000 budget will reiterate,
                 to helping hire 100,000 new teachers by 2005. In response to the President's request, the
                FY 1999 appropriations act provided the first installment of the necessary funding, $1.2
                billion to help hire more than 30,000 new teachers. The FY 2000 budget surpasses the
                previously articulated policy path with a $200 million increase over FY 1999, providing
                $1.4 billion to continue financing the 30,000 teachers hired with FY 1999 funds, and to
                add roughly 8,000 more teachers for a total of over 38,000. The Administration is
                confident and strongly committed to reaching this goal by 2005.
