   Subject:         Comparisons between S. 1415, AG's and Hatch/Feinstein

   We're faxing you a table (also attached)             summarizing what we now know
   about the financial differences.

   Please note that we really don't know what's in Hatch/Feinstein (e.g.,
   whether there is or is not a credit for tort fund and whether it is
   limited to 1/3, what the year-by-year amounts are and what the relative
   spending priorities are, just to name a few) .

   For S. 1415/AG's/Hatch, the table shows 25 year gross real payments of
   $408B,. $267B & $303B, respectively.

   The cost/pack ranges from $1.10 real to $0.64 to $0.69.

   5 Yr nominal net receipts go from $59B to $40B to $47B, using our
   guestimated CBO scoring.
