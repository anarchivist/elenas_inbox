TOBACCO

   October Trends: After Year Of Price Hikes, Consumpt·ion Declines
                Moderating, Oligopoly Working.

HIGHLIGHTS

   1.Consumption declines appear to be stabilizing, following a year of
     rapid price hikes. Since last October, retail cigarette prices have
     increased from $1.75/pack to $1.97/pack, before the recent
     $.45/pack price hike as'sociated with the new AG settlement. The
     13% price increase corresponds to an incremental consumption
     decline of just over 3% -- which implies an elasticity of -0.2.

   2.While industry mix has been stable (premium share 72.0% vs. 71.6%
     YA; private label share 4.2% vs. 4.4% year ago), the "Big 3" have
     ceded considerable private label share to Liggett and other
     renegades, who have passed along little of the recent price hikes.
     Over the past year, share of private label held by Liggett and smaller
     players has jumped from 30.8% to 41.0%.

   3.The price gaps between Marlboro and Doral ($.61/pack) and
     between Marlboro and lowest-priced brands ($.80/pack) are at their
     highest levels since Marlboro-Friday. The price gap between RJR's
     Doral ($1.50/pk) and B&W's GPC brand ($1.64/pk), which were
     at parity until early-1998, has now increased to $.14 /p·ack, which
     has caused B&W share to decline at double-digit clip.

   4.Philip Morris (+0.7pt), Lorillard (+0.3pt), and the renegades
     (+0.4pt) continue to gain share from RJR (-0.4pt) and B&W
     (-1.0pt). PM's and Lorillard's gains reflect single-minded focuses
     behind Marlboro (+1.3pt) and Newport (+0.3pt), respectively.
     RJR's Winston (-0.3pt) and Salem (-0.2pt) continue to decline at
     double-digit rates. Liggett's share (-O.lpt) appears to have
stabilized.

   5.The trade deload (13-14 billion sticks at end of 3Q) appears to be
     near-complete, with new orders being placed at the higher prices.
     We look for an industry shipment decline of 18-20% in 4Q, due to
     the de load (PM -16%, RJR -22%). We expect Philip Morris 4Q
     estimates to fall $.05/share (FY $3.10) to reflect the full deload in
     4Q, rather than split between 1998/4Q and 1999/1Q.

   6.We expect shipments to decline by about 6% in 1999 (PM -5%,
     RJR -7%), based on an anticipated price elasticity of -.25 on the
     $.45/pack (+23%) increase that becomes effective on the top brands
     after New Year's Day (minor brand prices already taken). Smokers,
     rather than quitting, continue to search out retailers in the gas and
     convenience classes of trade who have cut margins on cigarettes to
     5-8% or to state minimums, to build traffic. This pricing disparity
     among different classes of trade is intensifying.

   7.We reiterate outperform ratings on Philip Morris and RJR.
     Near-term, we continue to expect RJR to outperform Philip Morris,
     given pressures on RJR management to unlock value in front of the
     likely proxy fight (filing deadline 3/12, Annual Meeting 5/12) .
