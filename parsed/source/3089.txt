TEXT:
So I know you have many more important things on your plate and I feel pretty
bad for asking you again, but I think we left this question open: can I accept
expenses from the U of Chicago for an activity stemming from my position there?
Many, many thanks.  If you ccould tell me sometime before the middle of next
week, that would be great.
