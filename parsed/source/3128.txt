The latest news, in case you haven't heard, is:
1.  The Forest Service has not completed its search.  In fact, there may be as
much as 500 million bd ft -- yes, 500 million -- of pre-1991 Hogan sales that
the Forest Service hasn't quite found yet. Of course, there may not be nearly
so much. We don't know.   The judge is being told we will file a supplemental
pleading by November 15.
2.  The four BLM sales are being reported to the Court as something other than
318 sales, though some will say they look suspiciously like 318 sales.  BLM is
arguing that they are not 318 sales because the original purchasers walked away
from the contracts.
I suspect the district court judge is going to be one upset man tomorrow.
And, of course, we may have a huge problem coming down the road with respect to
the as yet undiscovered Forest Service sales.
