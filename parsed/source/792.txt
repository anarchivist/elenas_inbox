      Attached is a draft memo on products.  In addition to giving this draft to
      the two Bruce's, I also gave a copy to Erskine (because he was clamoring
      for it).  I told Erskine that the draft is very much a work-in-progress
      and that you guys and Bruce L have not yet rev'iewed it.

 MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

 FROM:

 SUBJECT:                  PRODUCTS LIABILITY LEGISLATION

         Congress may tum its attention to product liability legislation within the next month, and
 we need to know how to respond. As you recall, your veto message last year detailed a number
 of specific objections to the products bill. (The veto message is attached to this memo.) We
 presume that if Congress were to give you the same bill again, you would veto it for the same
 reasons. It is possible, however, that Congress will work to pass a bill that responds in part to
 your objections. This memo reviews those objections, outlines possible congressional responses
 to them, and solicits your views on how to proceed. We believe that we should send strong
 signals now about the kind ofbiII you would accept and the kind you would veto. We also think
 that knowing early where you stand on the products bill will enable the Administration to
 position itself correctly on other emerging law reform issues.

          One-way preemption. Prior to enumerating your objections to specific provisions in the
  bill, your veto message noted the "general problem of displacing State authority in an unbalanced
( manner." You explained that problem as follows: "As a rule, this bill displaces State law only
  when that law is more favorable to consumers; it defers to State law when that law is more
  helpful to manufacturers and sellers. I cannot accept, absent compelling reasons, such a one-way
  street of federalism."

          If you hold fast to this position, you will have to veto another product liability bill.
 Congress will not pass a bill that preempts, in identical fashion, both anti-consumer and pro-
 consumer state law. For its strongest supporters, this bill is not so much about achieving
 uniformity as about reducing liability burdens on manufacturers. Because a two-way preemption
 bill will not clearly achieve this goal, your insistence on a two-way bill will signal strongly that
 no compromise is possible.

         The objection to one-way preemption, however, is strong on the merits. If the problem
 with the current tort system is a simple lack of uniformity, then two-way preemption is obviously
 desirable. If the problem is instead that state law often fails to balance appropriately the interests
 of manufacturers and consumers, then federal law should step in to strike that balance, negating
 laws that tilt too much in either direction. One-way preemption is justified only if the goal is to
 reduce product actions to the greatest extent possible, by enabling states to "pile on" to federal
 limits.




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion



                                                                                                         2

             Because this issue is not amenable to compromise, we need to know soon where you
      stand on it. We cannot develop a sound strategy before we know whether you could sign a bill
      containing one-way preemption. If you could sign such a bill, we will deemphasize the one-way
      preemption concern and focus on the specific provisions of the statute discussed in the rest of this
      memo.

              Eliminating joint liability for non-economic damages. Your veto message objected
      strongly to the provision of the bill that wholly eliminated joint liability for non-economic
      damages such as pain and suffering. You stated generally, in support of joint liability, that "when
      one wrongdoer cannot pay its portion ofthe judgment, the other wrongdoers, and not the
      innocent victim, should have to shoulder that part of the award." You also expressed doubt
      about distinguishing economic from non-economic damages, noting that a provision limiting
      only non-economic damages falls most heavily on non-working women, the elderly, the poor,
      and children.

             This issue, unlike the last, is amenable to compromise. The most likely compromise
      would be a proposal to eliminate joint liability for non-economic damages when, but only when,
      the wrongdoer is responsible for less than some specified percentage of the total judgment.
      Congress could say, for example, that joint liability for non-economic damages will not apply
      when a defendant's actions have caused less than 25% of the total harm suffered. Congress
      might try to compensate for this weakening of the joint liability provision by applying it to both
      economic and non-economic damages (perhaps using your veto statement's equation of the two
      kinds of damages to justify doing so), so that a "minor" wrongdoer would never have to shoulder
      any costs not his own.

              A compromise of this kind has the apparent benefit of relieving small-scale wrongdoers
      (how small depends on the percentage specified) ofthe obligation to pay the entirety of"
      potentially mammoth judgments. But by virtue of doing so, this compromise leaves innocent
      victims to bear the damage themselves when primary wrongdoers have gone bankrupt or are
      otherwise unable to satisfy judgments. You should consider whether you are comfortable with
      this kind of compromise and, if so, approximately where (10 percent?; 25 percent?; 50 percent?)
      you would draw the line.

              Capping punitive damages. You also objected in your veto statement to imposing caps on
      punitive damage awards, on the ground that caps undermine the ability of punitive awards to
      deter and punish egregious misconduct. You noted the provision of the bill allowing judges to
      exceed the caps in specified circumstances, but stated that this protection was insufficient "given
      the clear intent of Congress, as expressed in the Statement of Managers, that judges should use
      this authority only in the most unusual cases."

              A compromise on this issue is also possible; indeed, it may be hard to avoid given the
      Administration's prior statements on the subject. The judicial override provision is essentially
      the brainchild of the Justice Department, which offered it as a way to alleviate our concerns



                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

about caps on punitives. If Congress deletes the legislative history to which you objected -- and
especially if it also softens some of the language in the override provision -- you will have little
basis for continuing to object to the bill's punitive damage ceilings.

        Limiting liability ofbiomaterials suppliers. You expressed a "concern" in your veto
statement about a provision in the bill limiting actions against suppliers of materials used in
devices implanted in the body. You generally recognized this provision to be a "laudable attempt
to ensure the supply of materials needed to make lifesaving medical devices." But you said that
this limitation should apply only to non-negligent suppliers -- and not to suppliers who know or
should know that the materials they make, when implanted in the human body, will cause injury.

         The current version of the biomaterials provision contains an exception for manufacturers
of the silicone gel used in breast implants, but not an exception (of the kind you requested) for all
negligent suppliers. Industry engaged in good-faith negotiations with Rep. Berman last year to
develop such an exception, but could not find a way to exempt negligent suppliers, while
adequately protecting non-negligent suppliers from the high litigation costs associated with
disproving negligence. Industry is currently looking into other ways to satisfy our concern :- for
example, by limiting liability for biomaterials suppliers only when the FDA has reviewed and
approved the implanted device -- and may well succeed in doing so. Indeed, we may wish to
send a signal that Congress should remove this provision from the products bill, so that we can
sign it separately.

        Other provisions. Your veto statement contained a number of objections to more minor
provisions ofthe bill relating to the statute of repose, statutes ofiimitations, and negligent
entrustment actions. With the possible exception of the statute of repose provision, compromise
on these issues should be easy; members of Congress already have indicated a willingness to
delete the offending language. On the statute of repose, the current bill precludes any suit
alleging a defect in a productthat is more than 15 years old; we could urge an 18-year statute of
repose, as we accepted in the aviation liability bill you signed; alternatively, we could press for
some kind of exception from the statute of repose for products, such as farm equipment, intended
to have a useful life of longer than 15 years.

        Other legislation. In the event you choose to reiterate your concerns and veto another
products liability bill, you may have other opportunities to signal support for appropriate reform
of the legal system. In particular, Sens. Lieberman, Moynihan, and McConnell have proposed a
so-called "auto-choice" bill, which would allow a driver to select a no-frills auto policy that
would reimburse him for all economic costs, but eliminate his option to sue for non-economic
losses such as pain and suffering. Trial lawyers are certain to oppose this proposal, but unlike the
products liability bill, it probably would benefit consumers. Some experts say that the savings
for low-income drivers could reach 45 percent of their current insurance premiums -- and that the
nationwide savings over two years could exceed $80 billion.
