TEXT:
Last week's kidding aside, we really have become embarrassingly late on a
lot of congressional letters to the President.   (I know because the leg
affairs office is irked enough to have sent over a complete list.)   Let's
try to get up-to-date in the next week.
Also we were reminded in this morning's senior staff meeting about the
importance of. the policy councils giving appropriate assistance to the
staff secretary's office in responding to letters.   Apparently, Erskine
met with the Staff Sec's office recently and this became a main topic of
conversation.
