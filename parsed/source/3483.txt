TEXT:
As I told you yesterday, our office is setting up a meeting for later in the day
to discuss all the California alternatives and try to reach (finally) a
resolution.
The last page of the Greenstein memo talks about CA's timing problems.  It
sounds as if they need this morning either (1) a decision to grant CA's request
or (2) a USDA commitment that quality control errors resulting from our
consideration 0
o
f this request be excused for good cause.  Since we can't have
the first this morning, I think we should try to do the second.        Can you call
folks at USDA and ask them to make this commitment?
I'll call you this morning if I can.
