TEXT:
I was just up meeting w/ the House Judiciary Comm. staff on the
PTO bill (John: I'm sure John Kamensky will give you a·summary; it
was a good and short (!!). meeting.)  When I indicated that we had
not reached a final Administration position on the congressional
notification issue, Rep. Schroeder's staff person spoke up to
complain about Members reading it in the newspaper rather than
being informed by the White House when someone senior is fired.
She implied that that was the motivation (at least on Schroeder's
part) for the language on notification.
I don't have a view on the disagreement between NPR/OMB and
Counsel's office.  But if Counsel's view prevails, one compromise
w/ the Hill might be to have the President simply notify Congress
without giving a reason for the removal of the Commissioner.
