TEXT:
Mike-- could you talk with Barry Toiv about the advisory board eo? Susan
Page of USAToday wants to do a story abou"t how we use our executive
powers, focusing on one particular executive action, and your eo seems the
right one to highlight.  (I believe Burce gave Barry a couple of other
choices, but yours is clearly the best.)   I told Barry a bit about the
idea, but said that you'd provide him with more detail.   thanks.
