Subject:         Re: NBAC response to stem cell query

Rachel just called to say that Harold Shapiro announced during the meeting
that the Commission would consider the draft response this morning but
that he expected it would take longer, i.e., the next couple of days, to
finalize the language of the response. She expects the letter to be
completed before the end of the week, but not this morning. She expects
the conclusions of the Commission will be clear by this morning and that
finalizing the letter will only be a matter of wordsmithing, but can't be
certain of that at this point.

Subject:         NBAC response to stem cell query

Chris, Elena    At 8:00 a.m. this morning, we spoke with Rachel Levinson,
who is at the NBAC meeting in Miami. She reports that the Commission will
discuss the draft of their response to the President on the stem cell
issue this morning; she expects to fax a copy to us very shortly --
perhaps by 10:00 a.m. As soon as we have something in hand, we'll pass it
along to you right away. Should you need to reach Rachel in the meantime,
her pager number is 1  P6/(b)(6) I.                                          [OOl.f]
