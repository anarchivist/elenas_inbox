TEXT:
Nice of you to say so: I wrote it.
One possibility is to do this, as you say, in response to a bad RFRA
decision (though there's a chance that the RFRA decision will be fine).
Another is to do it .in response to Republican efforts to pass a religious
liberty constitutional amendment.   Supposedly, the Republicans have agreed
on Amendment language (last year, there were two competing versions) and
are ready to start pushing it.
