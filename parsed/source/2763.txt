TEXT:
I'm a little confused about what all the attached is; please give me a
call about it. The VP is looking for something to do on Thursday, and it
might be good to have him make an announcement that helps us to rollout
the crime bill. But I'm baffled about what Morley sent me.

Re:
Crime Mapping and Data Driven Task Force
Steering Committee Meeeting
Monday, March 22, 1999
3 p.m. to 5 p.m
810 Seventh Street, N.W.
Room 3500
Jack Fahey can go over with you - - his number is   I   P6/(b)(6)

Background: This isn't a speech. You don't need to be there for two hours,
but it would be great if you could be there to open the meeting at 3pm and
stay for 30-45 minutes? Unfortunately Ray Fisher is not able to be there
today; Jeremy Travis will be representing DOJ and opening the meeting with
you. The purpose of this session is to:
 listen to the reports of the three sub-committees
 hear the first cut at recommendations and
 make suggestions on how to strengthen/improve.

After the feedback, the Task Force members will work to strengthen them,
make sure that they are thoroughly thought through and vetted over the next
several weeks.

Since you put forward three questions as the "Morley test" at the kick-off
event, that should make you role easier at this meeting:

Talking Points:
* Thank the sub-committees for their work so far.
* Revisit the "Morley test"
* will this recommendation:
  - promote the shift to more effective 21st century law
enforcement?
* make a positive difference for communities?
* help reduce and prevent crime?

* FYI:
* There are some really important recommendations, here, that will
forever change government, for example:
* Supporting a more strategic role for US Attorneys - - this supports
a direction that Justice is moving in and makes it explicit.
* Creation of a National Public Safety Information Infrastructure - -
this could not only support law enforcement and emergency response
nationwide but also accelerate the development of the foundation for the
geographic information that every community needs and wants. Jack, Katie
and
the Dept of Interior are all excited about the potential for this.   And I
have spoken to Tom Kalil who is also quite interested.
* Shift performance measures for federal law enforcement agencies to
more focused on outcomes.
* Training of federal law enforcement in the use of GIS - - it is
clear from the work of the Task Force that the Feds are lagging behind the
locals on this - although Justice is working on this.
* using Distance learning is really new for Justice     Lynn has
gotten them in touch with her cybercast network and they have found some
additional great resources.

* What isn't in the package that you may want to raise:
* Not all the recommendations are included, privacy is a big one that
isn't finished yet and needs to be in the final package.
* The recommendations are directed more at long term change - - and
probably as they stand won't have an immediate impact on crime.
Interestingly - - there is no formal or informal way that I have found for
Justice to have a strategic discussion with police officials in cities that
are having problems reducing their crime rate.
* There are lots of data questions that will be included in the final
package.
* Funding issues will be addressed after the Steering Committee
the rule from OMB is, however, no new money.
