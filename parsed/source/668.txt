TEXT:
1. starting from when? It would seem a bit peculiar to count any welfare
recipient ever hired. Do they mean starting from when the welfare bill
was signed? that would make more sense.   But even if they report earlier
progress, I think we should also make them keep track from the time of the
directive.

2&3. Agencies should definitely encourage contractors and grantees to do
this and should definitely keep track of their success.  But they should
separate these numbers out, so we can know what is attributable to what.

4.   We should try to get a commitment from the postal service.

5.  I don't think we know yet. My understanding is that Jodie thinks the
EOP jobs for welfare recipients should come from outside the White House
proper.  Is this wrong?
