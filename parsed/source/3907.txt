TEXT:
I told Janet Yellin that I would work hard to make sure that the First
Lady mentioned the CEA white paper some time during the day. Nothing more
than a single sentence is necessary -- something to the effect that the
cea is releasing a report today demonstrating the returns from investing
in young children.   Is that OK with everyone? Let me know if it's a
problem. Thanks.
