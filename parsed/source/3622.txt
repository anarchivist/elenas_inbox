MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

FROM:                    JACK QUINN

SUBJECT:                MISSION STATEMENT -- COUNSEL'S OFFICE

         The mission of the Counsel's Office is to provide legal advice to the President and other
members of the Executive Office with respect to their official duties. As part of this mission, the
Counsel's Office deals with investigations of Administration actions by Congressional
committees and independent counsels; responds to document requests and subpoenas; provides
advice concerning the ethics laws to the entire White House staff; ensures the appropriateness of
contacts between the White House and the agencies; oversees the vetting of executive branch
nominees; coordinates the selection of judicial nominees; reviews pardon recommendations;
works with the Justice Department in determining the litigation position of the United States in
important or controversial cases; advises the President on proposed Constitutional amendments,
criminal justice policy, and law reform proposals; and provides legal analysis on a wide range of
legislative and policy initiatives, such as campaign finance regulation, abortion law, and welfare
reform. In performing all of these functions, the Counsel's Office attempts to combine rigorous
legal advocacy and analysis with finely-tuned political judgment.

I. Structure, Functions, and Needs of the Counsel's Office

        The Counsel's Office currently has 16 attorneys: the Counsel to the President, two
Deputy Counsels, on~ special counsel, 11 associate counsels, and one special assistant. The
Counsel and one deputy counsel (Wallman) have overall supervisory responsibility. The other.
deputy counsel (Lindsey) plays the senior counseling role with respect to a number of issues (for
example, law reform proposals), in addition to undertaking certain responsibilities, particularly
with respect to presidential travel, not specifically related to the counsel's office.

        The special counsel and several associate counsels working with her have had primary
responsibility for handling certain major investigations -- in particular, the Whitewater and
Travel Office matters. This group of lawyers, in addition to performing standard legal functions,
has a substantial role in dealing with Congress and the press on investigative matters.

        One associate counsel has responsibility for the process of selecting judicial nominees
and guiding them through the confirmation process. The other associate counsels have
responsibility for a wide range of other counseling and policy matters, but generally fall within
one of two categories. The first group enforces the many ethics standards applicable to the White
House, including rules relating to financial disclosures, conflicts of interest, contacts with
many of these rules and personnel decisions, it also vets executive branch nominees. The second
group provides the President and a variety of White House offices with substantive analysis and
advice, whether regarding litigation positions (for example, on physician-assisted suicide),
proposals to reform the civil and criminal justice systems (for example, on tort reform), or legal
issues involved in other legislative and administrative initiatives (for example, in implementation
of the welfare law).

        The nature of the Counsel's Office work necessitates coordination with other offices in
the White House. In addition to the 16 lawyers actually assigned to the Counsel's Office, a
number of lawyers from other White House offices regularly attend Counsel's Office meetings.
These include two lawyers on the staff of the National Security Council, who report to the
Counsel on legal matters arising from the conduct of foreign relations; the Counsel to the Vice
President; the Counsel to the Office of Administration, who has become involved in certain
investigative matters; and a member of the Legislative Affairs Office with special responsibility
for congressional investigations. Conversely, two lawyers from the Counsel's Office involved in
handling investigative matters -- FabianilDavis and Yarowsky -- share functions with, and have
close relations to, the Press Office and Legislative Affairs Office, respectively.

       In addition, all attorneys in the Counsel's Office have a substantial amount of work-
related interaction with other White House offices. The ethicists have extensive dealings with
the Office of Management and Administration and Presidential Personnel, but they also deal with
inquiries from every comer of the White House. The attorneys who primarily work on policy
issues have regular relations with individuals in the Chief of Staffs Office, the Domestic Policy
Council, National Economic Council, Council on Environmental Quality, Legislative Affairs
Office, and Office of Management and Budget. In addition, almost all attorneys, at one time or
another, work with the Press Office.

        The Counsel's Office holds meetings three times each week for all attorneys. At these
meetings, attorneys raise issues arising from their work for general office discussion and update
the Counsel and Deputy Counsels on ongoing projects. In addition, the Counsel and one Deputy
Counsel hold a weekly meeting with officials of the Justice Department (the Deputy Attorney
General, Associate Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal
Counsel) to discuss policy matters pending in that Department of interest to the White House.
Finally, the Counsel, Deputy Counsels, and associate counsel in charge of judicial selection hold
a meeting each week Congress is in session, with representation from the First Lady's Office,
Vice President's Office, Legislative Affairs Office, and Office of Policy Development of the
Justice Department, to discuss pending and potential judicial nominations. In addition to these
three meetings, the Counsel's Office plans to regularize its contacts with the General Counsels of
the Cabinet departments by instituting a once-a-month meeting with that group of lawyers.

        The Counsel's Office currently needs one or two more attorneys, and appropriate support
for these attorneys, in order to handle the investigations arising from contributions to the 1996
campaign. One additional attorney slot would be sufficient if the Legislative Affairs Office can
hire another person to do congressional relations on this matter; two would be necessary -- one to


                                                          Automated Records Management System

Affairs. The Counsel's Office also needs continued flexibility to bring over detailees from other
agencies in order to respond to short-term increases in workload. For example, the Counsel's
Office is now using more than 15 detailees to vet nominees for executive branch positions.
Similarly, the Office may need to use detailees to respond to future bumps in investigative work.
 In the past, the Office has had a productive relationship with Jodie Torkelson, who has
understood and accommodated the Office's need for flexibility. It is extremely important to the
Counsel's Office that this pattern of flexibility and accommodation continue in the future.

II. Contribution of the Counsel's Office to Administration Goals

         A critical challenge for the Administration is to advance the President's policy agenda--
through legislation, executive action, and when appropriate, litigation. The Counsel's Office can
play an important role in achieving this objective and should be part of the policy loop on a very
wide range of matters. The Counsel's Office of course should pilot White House consideration
of litigation positions, as the Office recently did on briefs concerning physician-assisted suicide
and remedial education assistance for parochial schools. The Counsel's Office also should take
the lead role on law reform issues, such as proposals (sure to be taken up in the next Congress)
limiting product liability or securities lawsuits. And even when another White House office has
primary responsibility for advancing a policy objective, the Counsel's Office should play an
integral part in every stage of the policy process -- becoming in essence, the lawyer for the NEC,
DPC, or other White House office. This kind of continuing participation has contributed
significantly to such efforts as the enactment and implementation of welfare reform. When it
does not occur -- as, for example, in certain work on ethics reform -- there is a substantial chance
(1) that legal issues will come to the surface only at the twelfth hour, when they can wholly derail
the policy process or (2) that the courts will strike down what the Administration accomplishes.

        A second challenge for the Administration is to establish and maintain a useful working
relationship with the Republican Congress while resisting that body's efforts to invade necessary
Presidential powers and prerogatives. The handling of congressional investigations by the
Counsel's Office can advance these twin goals. In approaching these investigations, the Office
should seek to promote the President's interest in effective governance by making all reasonable
accommodations to congressional demands for information. At the same time, the Counsel's
Office must ensure that its accommodations leave intact the core powers of the President, so that
he can continue to perform his constitutional functions. Striking this balance -- knowing when to
bend to congressional will and when to assert appropriate presidential prerogatives -- is a
difficult but absolutely essential task, which requires toughness, realism, and political judgment.

        Finally, though most importantly, the Administration must maintain its commitment to
the highest ethical standards. The Counsel's Office can and does promote this goal by ensuring
full compliance with ethical laws, whether regarding conflicts of interest, financial disclosures, or
the appropriate use of official resources. More generally, the Office promotes this goal by acting,
and encouraging others to act, in accordance with the values of candor and integrity. The
fortunes of this Administration will ride in large measure on)ts reputation for honest dealing,
and the Counsel's Office can take the lead in enhancing and protecting that reputation.
