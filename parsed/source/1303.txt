agreed. slightly more info--seems that, the govs are under the impression
that the secretary of hhs has the descretion to allow states to count
those who are short some number of work participation hours.    they got
this from afsme. don't know if its true--and deans folks don't know if
chiles will like this anyway. this is what the DGA talked to craig about.
bot tern line--nothing has changed, no clear consensus yet on a compromise
from govs--but we know they'll want something related to work.
