MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Gene Sperling
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                  New Initiatives on Discretionary Side of Budget

        Assuming OMB can come up with another $5 billion for discretionary spending, the
DPC, NEC, and OMB all recommend that you propose to fund the new initiatives listed below in
your FY 1999 budget. We already have given you detailed memos on most of these initiatives.
If you approve the initiatives, you can announce them in the State of the Union.

Education

1. Education Opportunity Zones -- $225 million: This intiative will provide funding to about
25 high-poverty urban and rural school districts for agreeing to adopt a "Chicago-type" school
reform agenda that includes ending social promotions, removing bad teachers, reconstituting
failing schools, and adopting district-wide choice.                                         .

2. College-School Partnerships -- $170 million: This initiative, which builds on the Eugene
Lang model and Congressman Fattah's proposal, will provide funding for college-school
partnerships designed to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to students in
high-poverty schools, starting in the sixth grade and continuing until high school gradutation.
The first year's investment could reach as many as 200,000 seventh graders at 1,800 high-poverty
schools. [check)

3. Teacher Recruitment and Preparation -- $67 million: This initiative, which you previewed
last July, will provide scholarships to nearly 35,000 new teachers over the next five years for
committing to work in high-poverty urban and rural schools. It also will upgrade the quality of
teacher preparation programs serving these communities.

4. Technology Teacher Training -- $80 million: This initiative will provide intensive training
in the use of technology to at least one teacher in every school and require that teacher to train his
or her colleagues.

5. Hispanic Education Dropout Plan -- $110 million: This initiative will increase funding for
a variety of existing programs -- Bilingual Education, TRIO College Preparation, Adult
Education, Migrant Education, etc. -- and take certain administrative actions to help Hispanic

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion




     students complete high school and succeed in college.

     6. After-School Program Expansion -- additional $60-160 million: This part ofa much larger
     child care initiative (most of which is funded on the mandatory side of the budget) will provide
     additional funding to the 21 st Century Community Learning Center Program (now funded at $40
     million) for before- and after-school programs for school-age children at public schools.
     Depending on the exact funding level chosen, this investment will create programs in 1,500-
     4,000 new schools.

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     Bruce Reed
                          Gene Sperling
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                 New Initiatives on Discretionary Side of Budget

        Assuming OMB can come up with another $5 billion for discretionary spending, the
DPC, NEC, and OMB all recommend that you propose to fund the new initiatives listed below in
your FY 1999 budget. We already have given you detailed memos on most of these initiatives.
If you approve the initiatives, you can announce any or all of them in the State of the Union.

        Because so many of the new initiatives involve education, we are attaching an appendix
to this memo that shows recommended funding levels for the Department of Education's major
base programs.

Education

1. Education Opportunity Zones ($225 million): This initiative will provide funding to about
25 high-poverty urban and rural school districts for agreeing to adopt a "Chicago-type" school
reform agenda that includes ending social promotions, removing bad teachers, reconstituting
failing schools, and adopting district-wide choice.

2. College-School Partnerships ($150 million): This initiative, which builds on Eugene Lang's
model ofheIping disadvantaged youth, will provide funding for college-school partnerships
designed to provide mentoring, tutoring, and other support services to students in high-poverty
schools, starting in the sixth grade and continuing through high school. The six-year funding
path would provide help to nearly 2 million students.

3. Campaign on Access to Higher Education ($20 million): This initiative will fund an
intensive publicity campaign on the affordability of higher education. The goal of the campaign
will be to make every family aware that higher education is now universally accessible -- and that
it is the key to higher earnings. As part of this effort -- and to complement the college-school
partnership program described above -- we will provide families at high-poverty middle schools
with an official notification of the $20,000 or more that is already available for their children to
go to college.

4. Teacher Recruitment and Preparation ($67 million): This initiative, which you previewed


                                                                          }.1anagement System
                                                        Automated Records
                                                        Hex.-Dump conversion




                                                                                                           2

     last July at the NAACP Conference, will provide scholarships to nearly 35,000 new teachers over
     five years for committing to work in high-poverty urban and rural schools. It also will upgrade
     the quality of teacher preparation programs serving these communities.

     5. Technology Teacher Training ($222 million): This initiative dedicates 30 percent of the
     Technology Literacy Challenge Fund to ensure that at least one teacher in every school receives
     intensive training in the use of technology for education, so that they can train their colleagues.
     An additional $80 million will begin an effort to train every new teacher in the latest technology.

     6. Hispanic Education Action Plan -- ($195 million or more): This initiative will increase
     funding for a number of existing programs to improve education for Hispanic Americans and
     other limited English proficient (LEP) children and adults. It would double our investment in
     training teachers to address the needs of LEP children; boost the Migrant Education Program by
     16 percent; increase the TRIO college preparation program by 10 percent; and create a 5-year,
     $100 million effort to disseminate best practices in ESL training for adults. We would
     accompany these program increases with administrative actions to help Hispanic students
     complete high school and succeed in college.

     Child Care

             We recommend placing most of the child care initiative -- in particular, the proposed
     increase in the Child Care and Development Block Grant and the establishment of a new Early
     Learning Fund -- on the mandatory side of the budget. The smaller pieces ofthe initiative that
     we propose placing on the discretionary side are the following:

     1. After-School Program Expansion ($150 million): This program expansion will increase
     funding of the 21st Century Community Learning Center Program (now funded at $40 million)
     for before- and after-school programs for school-age children at public schools. Depending on
     the exact funding level chosen, this investment will create new programs in 1,500-4,000 schools.

     2. Standards Enforcement Fund ($100 million): This new fund will support state efforts to
     improve licensing systems and to enforce health and safety standards, particularly through
     unannounced inspections of child care settings. The fund also will enable states to issue report
     cards, for use by consumers, on the quality of the facilities inspected.

     3. Provider Training ($51-60 million): A new Child Care Provider Scholarship Fund, which
     you proposed at the Child Care Conference to fund at $50 million annually, will support 50,000
     scholarships each year to students working toward a child care credential. The students will
     commit to remaining in the field for one year for each year of assistance received, and will earn
     increased compensation or bonuses when they receive their credential. An additional $1-10
     million will allow the Department of Labor to expand its Child Care Apprenticeship Training
     Program, which funds providers combining work toward a degree with on-the-job practice.




                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                       3

    4. Research and Evaluation Fund ($10-30 million): This new fund will provide grants for
    research projects, establish a National Center on Child Care Statistics, and set up a national child
    care hotline.

    5. Paid Leave Demonstration Fund ($10 million): This small evaluation and demonstration
    fund will support communities and organizations that are testing and/or studying innovative
    approaches to providing financial assistance to parents who wish to stay home with their
    newborns.

    6. Early Head Start Expansion ($284-334 million): This level of increased investment in the
    overall Head Start budget should permit doubling the set-aside for Early Head Start without
    reducing the resources available for children 3-5. The doubled set-aside would enable more than
    35,000 additional children to receive Early Head Start services in 2002.

    Welfare,.Housing, Urban

    1. Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers ($283 million): This initiative will provide 50,000
    new housing vouchers to help welfare recipients in public housing who need to move in order to
    find employment. HUD will distribute these vouchers on a competitive basis to public housing
    authorities working with local T ANF agencies and/or grantees of the new $3 billion welfare-to-
    work program. (A separate proposal, for which no new funding is needed, would allow families
    in public or assisted housing to use vouchers to buy a home; HUD expects this proposal to help
    some 25,000 people become homeowners over two years.)

    2. Housing Portability/Choice ($20 million): In addition to the new welfare-to-work housing
    vouchers discussed above, our proposed package on housing portability and choice expands
    Regional Opportunity Counseling sites and takes administrative actions to eliminate obstacles to
    portability in the Section 8 housing program.

    3. "Play-by-the-Rules" Homeownership Proposal ($3Q million): This initiative would enable
    the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation to assist approximately 10,000 families to buy their
    own homes through downpayment assistance, interest rate buydowns, or rehabilitation loans.
    The assistance will go to families that have a perfect track record of paying their rent on time and
    otherwise "playing by the rules."

    4. Homeownership Opportunity Fund ($11 million): This initiative will allow HUD to
    develop a loan guarantee program to allow state and local governments to leverage current
    HOME funds with private-sector investments to fund large scale, affordable housing
    developments in distressed communities.

    5. Community Empowerment Fund ($400 million): This initiative establishes a public/private
    fund ("Eddie Mac"), which will invest in inner-city businesses and create a secondary market for
    economic development loans (like Fannie Mae).



                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion

Labor and Workforce

1. Child Labor ($89 million): This initiative is anchored by a $30 million commitment to the
International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC). The initiative also will include
funding to improve Customs Service enforcement of U.S. law banning the import of goods made
with forced or bonded child labor ($3 million) and to double the Department of Labor's
enforcement of child labor laws in the agricultural sector ($4 million). Finally, the initiative will
provide additional funding to the Migrant Education Program so it can reach 50,000 more
migrant children ($50 million). We will develop non-budget items to fill out the package.

2. Community Adjustment ($50 million): This initiative will fund the creation of the Office of
Community and Economic Adjustment (OCEA), which we proposed as part of the Fast Track
debate. As you know, this office will be modeled after the Defense Department's Office of
Economic Adjustment -- the Administration's first point of contact with communities
experiencing a military base closure or defense plant closing. We expect the Office to help
35-40 communities in its first year of operation. The initiative also will fund a variety of
other efforts to assist communities that face sudden and severe economic dislocation.

Health

1. 21st Century Trust Fund ($1 billion): This initiative will provide substantial additional
funding to Nlli ($750 million) and NSC ($250 million), ramping up substantially over time, for
research activities, including into the treatment and cure of diseases. We will provide you with a
separate memo on this initiative in the next day or two. Funding for this initiative will come
from comprehensive tobacco legislation.

2. AIDS Programs Expansion ($165 million): A funding increase for the Ryan White Program
of about 15 percent will go principally toward ADAP, to ensure that new and effective treatments
of AIDS reach those who need them. Some of the funds will support education and prevention
programs operated by states, cities, and community health centers, as well as by the CDC.

3. Racial Disparities in Health Care ($80 milIion): This initiative will address racial
disparities in six areas of health care: infant mortality, breast and cervical cancer, heart disease
and stroke, diabetes, AIDS, and immunization. The proposal includes additional funding ($50
million) to established public health programs to adapt and apply their prevention and education
strategies to eliminate racial disparities. It also includes funding ($30 million) for thirty local
pilot projects to test innovative approaches to reach this goal.

Crime

1. Community Prosecutors ($50 milIion): This initiative will provide grants to prosecutors for

     A number of the above proposals --~, education opportunity zones, university-school
     partnerships, housing vouchers -- can be presented as part of the race initiative, because they

     1. Civil Rights Enforcement ($68 million): This initiative will fund reforms to the EEOC and
     the civil rights. offices at DOJ, HUD, HHS, Education, and DOL. Most importantly, additional
     funding of$37 million will allow the EEOC to expand its mediation program (allowing more
     than 70 percent of all complainants to choose mediation by the year 2000), increase the average
     speed of resolving complaints (from over 9 months to six) and reduce the EEOC's current
     backlog (from 64,000 cases to 28,000). The initiative also will fund a dramatic expansion of
     HUD's civil rights enforcement office (in the 30th anniversary year of the Fair Housing Act) and
     improve coordination among the government's civil rights offices. We are preparing a number
     of non-budgetary administrative actions, especially involving fair housing and lending, to
     accompany our budget proposals in this area.
