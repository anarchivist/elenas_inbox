Subject:         Privacy meeting

Elena and Tom:

Sally would like to have the next NEC/DPC privacy meeting
next Wednesday at 1 p.m. to discuss:

1.   Legislative options (we didn't really get to this)

2.   Agency reaction to "privacy entity"

3.   Analysis of "self-regulatory" approach

4. What we can do to get our own house in order
(federal privacy principles)

Is this O.K. with you?
