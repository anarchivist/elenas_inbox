TEXT:
We'd really appreciate being kept in the loop on regulatory reform
matters. You obviously know more about this than anyone, but bruce and i
both have some views and would like a chance to participate.

That goes double for superfund.  I've heard you've requested an official
NEC-CEQ process.  If you don't mind, we'd like to be a co-chair as well.
Let me know if you think that's a problem.

Many thanks.
