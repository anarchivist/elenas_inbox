TEXT:
I talked with Randy yesterday after speaking with Emily.  As Emily recommnded, I
asked him to make a couple of changes in the last paragraph, which he agreed to
do. He's going to recirculate the letter around the Justice Department so that
interested people can review the new draft.  I assume the timing is sometime
next week.
