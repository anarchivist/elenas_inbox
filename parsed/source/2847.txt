     Subject: Re: racial profiling



     Thanks, Elena, for soliciting my input on the decision memo.


    1. I am for having a policy right now (even if it is provisional, pending
    data or experience), and I'm for forthrightly stating what the policy is
    and why. (Correlatively, I'm against having shadowy practices that reflect,
    sub silencio, policy made by folks who may not share the President's views
    on law enforcement or on race.)

    2. As to the nature of the policy, I can see three basic possibilities: a
    ban on racial profiling*; a general ban with an exception for certain INS
    activities; a general ban with an escape valve for exceptional
    justifications granted by the AG after notice and comment, and with
    safeguards of training, data collection, and sunset review.  While I don't
    feel strongly abot which of these POTUS does, I tend to favor the last
    option. And I think a principled discussion of why exceptions may be needed
    is precisely the kind of honest engagement of vexing issues that POTUS said
    he believes the nation needs on race.

    3. From all I have heard, the most important rationales driving the
    data-only option are the politics of embarrassment, combined with the
    traditional "Let's project cop-friendly toughness."  Afterall, the agencies
    are currently doing SOMETHING. So it shouldn't be rocket science to
    describe it and decide whether POTUS approves or disapproves. Data
    collection is, fundamentally, disingenuous. It may even be dissembling.

    4. If and when POTUS announces your version, the civil rights community
    will deride it. It is more like Safir than it is like Whitman, observers
    will say. Bradley will have a field day, and Gore will be humiliated.
    Editorial pages will write, "Fine. Data is good. Meanwhile, what is the
    policy, and why?" And I will be very interested to hear the
    Administration's answer.

    If you have a different political prediction, I'd be interested to know the
    basis for it -- with whom the White House has consulted, and with what
    description of options.

    5. In considering the merits of data-only, the President should think not
    only about cops who feel unjustly criticized and stereotyped, but also.
    about the Americans who are incensed about profiling (and who see it as the
    product of the same attitudes and stereotypes that give rise to brutal
    misconduct). Will these incensed people consider data collection a just and
    compelling example of leadership, responsive to their concerns? An
    inspiring use of the bully pulpit? Of course not. So, the further question
    is, why do THEIR concerns count so much less than the competing concerns?

    6. Finally, in considering the merits of the policy, all the President has
    to do is imagine himself to be brown or black in NYC, subject to intrusive
    frisks by Giuliani's cops; or a brown, 5th generation US citizen living
    near El Paso, subject to color-coded car searches whenever driving with a
    group of family or friends.  If he can explain why that is the kind of
    America we want, then he should do so.  If he can't, then he should stop
    the practice.


    I would welcome an opportunity to discuss with Jose, or read his draft
    characterizat~on of my position. I need to talk with him anyway about the
    current thinking on the crime bill, since I gather DPC things that the
    crime bill says just about all POTUS need to say to advance the vision in
    the book. (which is news to me!! (smile))
