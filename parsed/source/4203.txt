               AMERICA READS: HELPING ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD
                     CAN READ WELL AND INDEPENDENTLY

"Every child in America -- every single child in America needs to be able to read well, and needs to be able to read
independently by at least the end of the 3rd grade, so that all this other learning can occur. "

                                                                              President Clinton, September 8, 1997

Today, the President returned to the Lighthouse Elementary School in Jupiter, Florida to meet
with students, parents, teachers and community education supporters to discuss the importance of
a solid foundation in reading and to highlights his America Reads initiative. He called on all
Americans -- schools, libraries, religious institutions, universities, students, the media,
community and national groups, business leaders and senior citizens -- to help ensure that every
American child can read well and independently by the end of 3rd grade. Lighthouse Elementary
school's reading and parent involvement programs are examples of the actions that schools and
communities can undertake to help all children learn to read well.

PRESIDENT UNDERSCORES HIS COMMITMENT TO THE AMERICA READS
CHALLENGE. While American students today generally read as well as ever, 40% of our
fourth graders scored below the basic level on the 1994 National Assessment of Educational
Progress. According to studies, however, well-designed tutoring programs result in student gains
in reading. The America Reads Challenge sets forth the first comprehensive, nationwide effort to
create after-school, summer, and weekend tutoring in reading. The legislation proposed by
President Clinton links parents, teachers, AmeriCorps members, trained reading professionals,
and volunteer tutors to school, library and community literacy efforts.

The Challenge is pursuing several essential strategies to help our children learn to read: creating
more learning opportunities to supplement classroom reading instruction; encouraging parent
involvement to help children develop readiness skills for reading beginning at birth, as well as
involvement throughout the school years; and bringing best teaching practices into classrooms.
The proposal is a five-year, $2.75 billion commitment to local communities and organizations, as
well as national and regional efforts. It includes:

·       America's Reading Corps. The proposal would fund 25,000 reading specialists and
        coordinators, including 11,000 AmeriCorps members, to mobilize 1 million volunteer
        reading tutors.

·       Federal Work Study Expansion. President Clinton has asked college presidents to
        allocate work-study slots to college students to become America Reads tutors. So far,
        almost 800 colleges have pledged students to tutor in elementary schools.

·       Other Initiatives that are Helping Our Children Learn. America Reads incorporates early
        childhood development through the expansion of Head Start and Even Start; bringing the
        best teaching practices to classrooms; supporting research and evaluation on reading; and
        building partnerships with the private sector.

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
EFFORTS TO MOTIVATE YOUNG READERS. The Lighthouse Elementary School
participates in Florida's Sunshine State Young Readers program, which is a statewide reading
motivation program that encourages students to read high quality literature and participate in a
statewide vote for their favorite book. The President acknowledged the accomplishments of the
students who read and completed book reports on all 15 books on the Sunshine State reading list.
 In 1996, over 1,000 Florida public schools participated and over 75,000 students read enough
books to qualify for voting in the statewide balloting for their favorite book of the year.
Motivational reading programs, like the Sunshine State readers, are important in helping to reach
the President's goal that every child in America learn to read well and independently by the end
of the third grade.

PRESIDENT CLINTON HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTAL
INVOLVEMENT. The President commended the Lighthouse Elementary parent volunteers
who contribute 1,000 volunteer hours per month to assist teachers in the classroom, help prepare
documents, and provide assistance in the library. Research continues to show that parental
involvement is a crucial factor in children's learning -- students score better in reading, achieve
higher grades. and have fewer discipline problems when their parents participate in school
activities. Parents and other concerned individuals in local communities are valuable reading
partners and tutors and for young students learning to read and can engage in exercises to ensure
that each child has the proper foundation for good reading skills.
