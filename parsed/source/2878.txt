Subject: my mission, should I choose to accept it

Doug had requested, at the May 3 meeting, a mission statement for Monday's
summit on school violence ... Can you tell me whether one has
materialized? It'd be a big help to me as I draft remarks for the
President -- as would any other materials that are circulating.  Thanks.
