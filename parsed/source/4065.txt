Subject:         reconciliation mtgs this week

We're going to set up reconciliation discussions with the agencies on the
same schedule as last week -- a conference call Wednesday at 8:30 am
(we'll send out the number later) and a meeting in 248 at 3 pm on Friday,
the 20th.

PAD offices are responsible for informing their agencies about both
conversations.

For the conference call -- we are still confined to too few phone lines,
so please consolidate incoming calls (2nd floor folks should meet in
Jack;s office, DADs in PADs offices, etc.).  Please do not call in on a
cell phone (and PAD offices please tell you agencies not use cell phones
-- they generate too much noise) .

Thanks.
