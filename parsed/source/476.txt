Subject:         National PTA Conf.

As you may know, the National PTA conference which the President has
addressed in the past is being held in DC next week. I have gotten a
number of call from Arnie Fege, the PTA's Washington Rep inqulrlng as to
whether or not the President will speak. Did anyone ever send in a request
for the President to speak at this conference?

Please advise. I would like to call Arnie to formally regret.

Patrick Steel
