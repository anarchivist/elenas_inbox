oops . . . The issue that is being debated by the NAACP is not integration.
It is whether or not busing should be used as a means for integration.

Guess who called me today ... yes that's right Kweisi Mfume.  I informe'd him
that we are working out some internal details and should have a definite
decision on the President's participation sometime today or tomorrow.     We
walked through the conference schedule and themes.    Thursday is education
day for their conference.   Sec. Riley has already confirmed for
Thursday.
I also have some additional details on where the debate on integration
stands within the NAACP.   It appears, based on my conversation with
Kweisi,   to have been blown way out of proportion by the New York Times.
I will update you all in person.    Let me know where we stand.   Thanks

FYI:   KWEISI WILL BE THE PRESIDENT'S GUEST TOMORROW AT THE ORIOLES GAME.

          I have been tracking this issue for some time and I don't think the latest
          recommendations are going to sit well in the base community. Most people
          I talk to see this as a fairness issue.  they want both drugs to get equal
          punishment.   At the very least, they want the disparity closed.
          Politically it may not be possible to get it down to a one to one ratio,
          but we need to be move more in that direction especially now that we are
          engaged on the race initiative.

          In view of the political realities, I recommend 50 grams of crack be the
          threshold for the 5 year sentence. Additionally, 100 grams of powder
          cocaine should be the other threshold. According to local law enforcement
          authorities both drugs cost about the same per gram.  The only difference
          is one drug is in heavy use by young blacks and the other by mostly
          whites.
