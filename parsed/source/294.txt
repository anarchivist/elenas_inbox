TEXT:
Yes but:   It is very very unusual for the Justice Dept to decline to
defend the constitutionality of a law. The standard is that the law must
be "patently unconstitutional." I don't believe many (or any) of the
legal immigrant provisions would meet that standard.    (When DOJ does
decline to defend, it has not to notify Congress, so that Congress has an
opportuni ty to join the suit.)  So I agree that we' shouldn't go out of our
way to criticize Chiles -- but we should understand that we're almost
certainly going to be fighting him in court.
