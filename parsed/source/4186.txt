TEXT:
The problem is that it's all FOIAble there. We can write something that
we don't mind the world seeing, but (almost by definition) that won't be
of much use to the President.  Still, we certainly will do this if you
think it's important to have a policy section in the overall race report,
regardless of what it says.
