  TEXT:
  Late on Friday afternoon, we gave our proposed statutory language on timber to
  nat field and Dicks.  We decided not to incorporate any of the Sierra Club's
  suggestions about further changes we could make to the timber rider.   The next
  question is when (and, I suppose, if) we should send up a formal legislative
  proposal.   This in part depends on Hatfield's reaction to our draft language.
  Katie thinks we should try to get a read over the next few days of whether
  Hatfield and, more broadly, Congress is genuinely interested.   If not, she
  thinks we should go public with that and then throw our weight behind a full
  repeal.   She also thinks that whatever we do on timber, we have to do now,
. rather than wait until next year.   Martha thinks we should talk about this a bit
  more, taking into account Congress's current testiness and the status of the
  Tr.terior appropriations bill.  In her last e-mail, she suggested a short meeting
  with Leon and Pat, though it's not clear wh~n this would happen.
