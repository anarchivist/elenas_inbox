      I had hoped to discuss OSTP's comments with you prior to sending them off
      to OMB, but couldn't reach you before the "deadline" this morning.
      Hopefully, we are in accord on this.

OSTPsupports OMB's recommendation to delete this provision and add a footnote proposing to
"work with Congress to assess the impact of recent advances in biomedical research, such as
research on stem cells, that may hold promise for new methods for diagnosing, treating, and
curing disease."

The following comments address statements in the supporting discussion that need some
clarification:

·   While it is correct that previous budgets (FY97 and FY98) struck the ban, there was no
    proposal to address the ban in separate, non-appropriations legislation, as suggested in the
    OMB comments. The Administration position in those budgets was that it "does not support
    addressing this issue in legislation."

·   The statement that "the central issue is whether or not the ban on embryo research would
    cover stem cell research" does not fully capture the complexity ofthis debate. With respect
    to stem cells, there are really two questions--can the public sector isolate stem cells, and can
    they conduct subsequent research on those cells. The use of federal funds to isolate stem
    cells, if the cells are removed from embryos, is clearly prohibited by the ban because the
    isolation process results in the destruction of the embryo. However, federally funded stem
    cell research may in fact be permissible, as the OMB discussion demonstrates provided that
    federal funds were not used to isolate the cells. If it is determined that research on stem cells
    subsequent to isolation is not prohibited, the best motivation to lift the ban is lost, and we
    may create a situation where the private sector will control the isolation and subsequent
    supply of stem cells for public sector research.
