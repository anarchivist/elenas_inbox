              SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS OF CLONING BILL PROPOSED BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN

             A BILL

             To prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer, to provide
             for further review ofthe ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of somatic cell
             nuclear transfer in human beings, and for other purposes.

             The phrase "attempt to create a hurnan hein..g::_Gould he interpreted by certain factions as an
             attempt to create an embrYo, althoul.(h Ihis distinction is cleared lip in the prohibitions scction.

             SECTION 1. Short Title

             This Act may be cited as the "Prohibition on Cloning of Human Beings Act of 1998".

             This title is succinct and accurate, unlike the litlcs of other hills, such as the "Human Cloning
             Prohibition AcC ",,'hich cou lei implv prohibition of inadwrtent twinning of some infertility
             treatments.

             SEC. 2. Findings

             This section accuratelv recounts the findings of the NBAC on cloning.

             SEC. 3. Purposes.

             It is the purpose of this Act to-
                      (1) prohibit any attempt to create a human being using somatic cell nuclear transfer
             cloning; and
                      (2) provide for further review of the ethical and scientific issues associated with the use of
             somatic cell nuclear transfer in humans.

             On_C_Lagain, the phrase "attempt to create a human being" could be interpreted bv certain                                faction~
               an attempt to create an emhrYo.
             .<l§


             SEC. 4. Definitions.

             In this Act:
                      (1) Cloning- the production of a: precise genetic copy of a molecule (including DNA),
             cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

             Some scientists might arguc th~'t cloning is not a "precise" genetic COPy, duc to the invariable

                                                                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion




                   (2) Nucleus- the cell structure that houses the chromosomes, and thus the genes.

          8_CCcurale [(lube pHrQQse§gJthis_Acl, hut there are l!;enes outside of the nJ!!<lgl§ (miiQ..c..nmldrial
          genes.)

                   (4) Somatic cell-a mature, diploid cell.

          Not entirelv clear what "mature" means. If it means "differentiated" this would allow somatic
          cell nuclear transfer to create a human being using an undifferentiated ernbryo cell. which could

                 (5) Somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of an existing
          or previously existing human child or adult into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been
          removed.

           This language could allow (if one does not consider an emITlyo all existing human.s:.hild) the use
          of this technologv to treat infeliility due to mitochondrial defects. Perhaps a small point of
          semantics. but does "transferring the nucleus of a somat ic cell" include the fusion 0 f a somatic

          SEC. 5. Prohibition.

          It shall be unlawful for any person or other legal entity, public or private, to implant or attempt to
          implant the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus.

          This prohibition clearly states the scientific intent oCtile legislation. and avoids the question of

          SEC. 6. Protected Biomedical Research.

          Nothing in this Act shall be construed to restrict areas of biomedical and agricultural research or



                                                                                                Automated Records Management System

     practice not expressly prohibited in this Act, including research or practices that involve-
             (1) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or other cloning technologies to clone
     molecules, DNA, cells, and tissues; or
             (2) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques to create animals.

     SEC. 7. Penalties.
             (a) In General-Any person who intentionally violates the provision of section 5 shall be
     fined the greater of $250,000 or 2 times the gross pecuniary gain or loss resulting from the
     violation.
             (b) Civil Actions-If a person is violating or about to violate the provisions of section 5,
     the Attorney General may commence a civil action in an appropriate Federal district court to
     enjoin such violation.
             (c) Forfeiture-any property, real or personal, derived from or used to commit a violation
     or attempted violation of the provisions of section 5, or any property traceable to such property,
     shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States in accordance with the procedures set forth in
     chapter 46 of title 18, U.S. Code.
             (D) Authority-The Attorney General shall have exclusive, nondelegable enforcement
     authority under this Act.
             (E) Advisory Opinions-The Attorney General shall, upon request, render binding
     advisory opinions regarding the scope, applicability, interpretation, and enforcement of this Act
     with regard to specific research projects or practices.

     This section uses phrases such as "attempted violation." The prohibition alreadv includes the
     anemnt to impJant the product to a uterus. Would this then allow civil actions or forfeitures of

     SEC. 8. Cooperation with Foreign Countries.
            It is the sense of Congress that the President should cooperate with foreign countries to
     enforce mutually supported restrictions on the activities prohibited under section 5.

     SEC. 9. National Bioethics Advisory Commission Report.

           Not later than 4 Y2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the National Bioethics
     Advisory Commission shall prepare and submit to the President a report concerning-
           (1) the state of the science of somatic cell nuclear transfer;
           (2) the ethical and social issues associated with the potential use of this technology in



                                                                                                    Autqrnated Records Management System

     humans; and
           ~3) the advisability of continuing the prohibition established in the Act.


            The Commission is authorized to continue for the 10-year period described in section 12
     to prepare such a report and for other purposed as established in Executive order 122975 and
     subsequent amendments to such Order.

         i. Cloning--the production of a precise genetic copy of a molecule (including DNA), cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

         ii. Somatic cell--any cell of the body other than germ cells (eggs or sperm.)

         iii. Somatic cell nuclear transfer--the transfer of a cell nucleus from a somatic cell into an egg from which the nucleus has been removed.

         iv.Cloning-the production of a precise genetic copy of a molecule (including DNA), cell, tissue, plant, animal or human.

         v.Nucleus-the cell structure that houses the chromosomes, and thus the genes.


         vi.Oocyte-the female germ cell, the egg.

         vii.Somatic cell-a mature, diploid cell.

         viii.Somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a somatic cell of an existing or previously existing human child or adult into an oocyte from which the nucleus has
         been removed.

         ix. Human somatic cell nuclear transfer-- transferring the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert.

         x. Somatic cell--a cell of an embryo, fetus, child, or adult which is not and will not become a sperm or egg cell.

         xi. Embryo-The developing organism from the time of fertilization, or from the time of the single cell stage at the inception of growth and development of an organism, until
         significant differentiation has occurred.


         xii.Human somatic cell nuclear transfer-transferring the nucleus of a human somatic cell into an oocyte from which the nucleus has been removed or rendered inert.

         xiii. Oocyte-the mature female germ cell, the egg.

xv.Clone & Cloning-the practice of creating or attempting to create a human being by transferring the nucleus from a human clel from whatever source into a human cell from
which the nucleus has been removed for the purpose of, or to implant, the resulting product to initiate a pregnancy that could result in the birth of a human being.
