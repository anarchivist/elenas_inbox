BR/EK:

This is a disaster . . 1 think any guidance we give Joe and the press office
should be unequivocal in saying that we have no intention of releasing
criminals into our communities. Our budget includes new funds (about $22
million, not enough to cover the need).    And we have supported legislation
to delay the implementation of this detention requirement that we could
push for again as a temporary, if inadequate, solution.    But we should
immediately shut down any notion that we're entertaining releasing crimina

This was keeping me occupied the last hour or so.  We should be concerned
about this.

                                          INS Criminal Aliens
                                          Question and Answer
                                            February 4,1999


       Q.   Today, the Washington Post reported that the INS is considering a plan to release
            criminal aliens -- including drug offenders, and aliens smugglers -- into the
            community due to lack of detention space. Is this true?

       A.   Recent changes in the law has caused the number of people that INS must detain to
            skyrocket -- and despite the fact that this Administration has dramatically increased the
            number of criminal aliens removed to their country of origin, and increased detention
            space --- serious problems have arisen with INS' capacity to hold criminal aliens. The
            INS has worked with the Congress to find an acceptable answer to this problem but has
            not yet been able to come up with a satisfactory solution .. As a result, INS is exploring a
            variety of options to solve this problem.

            It should be clear that INS' primary concern for any plan is the impact on public safety.
            Among the options being considered are removing additional people to their country of
            origin, and alternatives for detention for those who do not pose a threat to the community.
             In addition, the INS is looking into separate plans for each local facility to detain the
            highest risk aliens and release those that present the lowest risk to the community. This
            plan is still being developed and is not final. Reports of releasing criminals is premature.
             INS is focused on protecting the community as its first priority and satisfying the
            requirements set out in the law.
