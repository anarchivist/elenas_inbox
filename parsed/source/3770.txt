MEMORANDUM FOR DON BAER

FROM:                     BRUCE REED
                          ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                  IDEAS


Health and Safety

Patients' Bill of Rights/Quality Commission: The counsel's office is almost done vetting our
nominations for the Quality Commission, which will be charged with developing a Patients' Bill
of Rights. Announcement of the Commission can be combined with the release ofa HHS
regulation that would guarantee an expedited appeal whenever a plan proposes to deny care that a
Medicare patient believes is urgently needed.

Home Health Care: We have asked HHS to review several regulatory and legislative proposals
on home health care. One legislative proposal, which will not be ready for at least several weeks,
would require criminal background checks for home health providers participating in Medicare.

Medicare fraud legislation: We have finalized and are ready to announce a new and very good
package of Medicare fraud and abuse initiatives. We can unveil this package during the
President's trip to Florida -- or ifit doesn't fit there, we can look for another opportunity to make
the announcement.

Classified research with human subjects: In response to recommendations of the President's
Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments, we have prepared (I) an Executive
Order strengthening protections for human subjects of secret research; and (2) legislation
expanding compensation for Cold War-era uranium miners. With one week's notice, we can be
ready to announce these policies and release a summary report detailing the Administration's full
response to the Committee's 18 recommendations.

Tobacco Advertising: We are reviewing a proposal for the President to take action responding
to tobacco companies' use of the internet and other fora to get around our tobacco regulation.
We could use "Kick Butts" day to announce this proposal, but we should first get DOJ assurance
that this proposal does not compromise our efforts to defend our tobacco regulation in court.

Seat Belt Study: The Department of Transportation will give the President a report in a week or
so on ways to increase seat belt use. DOT's report is likely to include ideas for presidential
challenges to states and business groups, as well as a proposal (consistent with our budget) to


                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

offer financial incentives to states to improve and enforce seat belt laws.

Children's Health EO: The DPC, NEC, CEQ, and OSTP are working on an executive order
designed to ensure that the federal government considers the special needs of children when
taking regulatory action. The executive order requires every agency to determine whether a
regulation may impose disproportionate risks on children and, if so, to evaluate the specific
effects of the regulation on children. Several agencies have raised serious last-minute objections,
but we are hoping that we can work these out in the next few weeks.

Education

School construction event. Scheduled for this Friday.

Teachers package. We have discussed unveiling this package during our trip to North Carolina.
 The President would call on state legislatures around the country to enact major pay incentives
for master teachers; explain how our proposed budget will help set a new national standard of
excellence in teaching; and issue a number of invitations and challenges.

Testing in Military Schools: We have secured the commitment of the Department of Defense to
give students in its schools our proposed 4th and 8th grade tests and to participate in the pilot
program. We can announce this commitment whenever (and wherever) we wish to do so.

State School Officer Endorsements: We are lining up endorsements for next Monday's
meeting with Chief State School Officers. We'll know by the end of the week where we stand.

California Endorsement of Testing Plan: California's superintendent, Delaine Eastin, is
prepared to endorse our testing proposal, and a group of Silicon Valley high-tech executives are
prepared to do so as well. We could do a good event during the President's visit March 24.
California's endorsement is very important, since the state has 10-15% of the country's
schoolchildren.

Advisory Panel for Education' Tests: The Education Department is thinking about the
appropriate structure and composition of a panel of teachers and other trusted educators to advise
on the development of our 4th and 8th grade tests. (The Department may decide to use an
existing, non-governmental group to perform this function.) We expect a decision in a few
weeks.

Teacher of the Year. The President will meet with the Teacher of the Year and other
outstanding teachers at the White House on April 15. He may be able to announce that the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards has selected additional master teachers.

Rollout of America Reads and Hope Scholarship. The President should announce the
transmittal of these two pieces of legislation.

                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dwnp Conversion

Roundtable on Standards. The President could participate in a session with teachers, students,
parents, and others to explain the standards associated with his 4th and 8th grade tests. The
roundtable would demonstrate with concrete examples the kind of student work -- and the kind
of teaching -- that reflects high standards.

Welfare

Welfare-to-Work Transportation Plan: We can announce at any time our Access to Jobs
proposal, which would allocate $ 100 million ofISTEA funding to improve transportation
systems so that welfare recipients and other low-income workers could get to work more easily.
Lack of convenient and affordable transportation is currently an obstacle to getting people from
welfare to work, and this proposed program is a very serious attempt to address this problem.

Child Support: We can announce new child support enforcement numbers, along with the
submission of a new HHS report on child support enforcement and our submission of legislation
(previously announced) to make it a felony to cross state lines to evade child support obligations.

Statutory Rape/Teen Pregnancy Prevention: DOJ should be ready sometime in April to
release a report on statutory rape and its relation to teen pregnancy rates. We could do a radio
address timed to coincide with the release of this report, discussing strategies to enforce statutory
rape laws and decrease teen pregnancies.

Crime and Drugs

Hard Liquor Advertising. For years, the hard liquor industry has voluntarily agreed not to
show liquor ads on TV. Some companies have now broken that agreement. In furtherance of his
National Drug Control Strategy roll-out, the President could send a letter to the FCC requesting
that they consider restrictions on hard liquor advertising on television during certain time
periods.


Sex Offender Registry. The President could visit the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children in Arlington, Virginia where he would take a tour offacility and announce
that the interim National Sex Offender Registration system -- which he directed the Attorney
General to develop in the June 21,1996 Radio Address -- is now up and running. He also would
announce that he is signing an Executive Order instructing the Attorney General and the
Secretary of Defense to ensure that sex offenders released from Federal and Military prisons are
listed in the national registry.

National Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The President's FY 98 Budget Submission includes
$175 million for a national anti-drug media campaign directed towards our youth. We will not be
able to expend any funds on this initiative until we enact the appropriation bill, but ONDCP can
expend discretionary funds in its FY 97 budget to begin producing anti-drug ads. At a Rose


                                                                   Automated Records Management System
                                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion



                                                                                                         4

    Garden event, the President could kick off his Administration's anti-drug media campaign with
    one of the celebrities who has committed to appear in an ad. The President could also release a
    letter that he is sending to every network issuing his challenge that they match our contribution
    and begin dedicating more air time to anti-drug ads. ONDCP is currently reaching out to
    celebrities and sports figures such as Michael Jordan, Grant Hill, and Tiger Woods to tape anti-
    drug ads, and this event should be ready sometime in April.

    Anti-Gang Prosecutor Event. The cornerstone of the President's Anti-Gang and Youth
    Violence Strategy is a $200 million anti-gang prosecution grant program. The President could
    meet with prosecutors from across the country in the Oval Office where they would thank him
    for his strong support in fighting gangs. The prosecutors -- Republican and Democrat -- would
    urge Congress to move quickly to pass the President's bill. We recommend April for this event.

    After schools Initiatives Event. To highlight his new after-schools initiatives in the Anti-Gang
    Bill, the President could visit a successful after-school program and meet with the kids helped by
    the program. That day, he also would announce that HHS is providing several million dollars in
    grants from its FY 97 appropriation for new after-school programs across the country. This event
    should occur after the anti-gang event described above.

    Victims Constitutional Amendment. In"June 1996, the President announced his support for a
    constitutional amendment for victims rights -- to guarantee victims the right to be notified, to
    receive restitution, receive reasonable protection measures, and to be heard at sentencing and
    parole hearings. At a White House event, the President could: (1) urge Congress to pass the
    Amendment quickly; (2) receive a report from the Attorney General-- in response to his June
    25, 1996 Directive -- outlining measures taken by the Justice Department to increase and
    improve Federal services and protections for victims of crime; (3) announce the creation of a
    Federal victim notification system; and (4) announce additional funding from the Victims Crime
    Fund -- which is larger than ever before -- that will be provided to victims services and shelters
    throughout the country. This event could occur on April 19, the third anniversary of the
    Oklahoma City bombing or during April 14-18, which is National Crime Victims Week.

    Service Summit

    Scholars' Program: We announced last year a $1,000 scholarship for high school students who
    have performed outstanding service, with the federal government putting up $500 and a
    community or service organization (e.g., Lions, Elks, Kiwanis, Moose) putting up the rest. We
    can be ready any time to do an event inviting high schools that have obtained matching funds to
    submit names of candidates for the scholarship (perhaps in conjunction with a letter from the
    President to every high school principal).

    Commitments: We could announce "commitments" from the federal government to the service
    summit -- proposals for how the federal government can support service and voluntarism to help
    youth. We could be ready to make such announcements in 2-3 weeks if necessary.


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
