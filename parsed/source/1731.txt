Subject: Office of Consumer Affairs

Steve Barr of the Post tells me the VA-HUD appropriations bill (currently
awaiting POTUS signature) zeroes out the Office of Consumer Affairs,
former home of such well-known Americans as Esther Peterson, Virginia
Knauer and Elizabeth Dole.   (Don't know who current head is.) Steve,
assuming we are not going to veto the bill over this, is asking what we
plan on doing.  Do we plan to reconstitute this office in some other
form? Has anybody thought about this?'

Steve is trying to write for tomorrow, so if we want to get into this
story, I need to hear from somebody.
