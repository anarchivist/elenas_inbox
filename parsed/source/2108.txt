                               Welfare Reform Questions and Answers
                                          March 23, 1998


       Question:   The Administration has pointed to the decline in welfare caseloads as a sign
                   that welfare reform is working, yet a story in today's Washington Post says
                   one of the main reasons people are leaving the rolls is that they are being
                   sanctioned. Do you consider this a success?

       Answer:     One of the principles of the welfare reform law enacted in August 1996 is
                   personal responsibility. Establishing fair, firm and credible consequences if
                   people fail to follow the rules is an important part of the new approach.
                   Sanctioning is often a step along the way to work. Data from several state studies
                   finds that after being sanctioned, about half the people are working and
                   approximately 40 percent have an increase in their income. Several states also
                   found that one-quarter to one-third ofthose sanctioned returned to the rolls,
                   presumably after complying with the requirements.

                   Our preliminary information shows that states are increasing the use of sanctions
                   only somewhat. According to HHS, in 1993 and 1995 32% and 33% of cases
                   were closed for failure to comply with procedural requirements and the
                   preliminary figures for October 1996 to June 1997 were 38%.

       Question:   The Post article cited a women in Tennessee who was sanctioned even though
                   she had back problems. Isn't it unfair to require someone like that to work?

                   federal law requires states to put 30 percent of recipients to work this year (a
                   figure which rises to 50 percent by the year 2002) and gives states considerable
                   flexibility in how they apply these work rules. According to a recent survey by
                   the American Public Welfare Association, most states waive sanctions when a
                   person has good cause for not complying, with disability, incapacity or illness the
                   most frequently cited reason for good cause (by 31 states). In addition, low
                   income individuals whose disabilities prevent them from working can receive
                   assistance under the federal SSI program, for which the work rules do not apply.


       Question:   Today's New York Times cites evidence in New York that only one-third of
                   those leaving the rolls are actually working. Are you disappointed by these
                   results?

       Answer:     We are understand that this New York State data is preliminary and
                   incomplete. We do know that a number of other ~tates have had much better
                   results, finding between between 50% and 60% of those leaving the rolls
                   were working. In an effort to give states strong incentives to help as many
                   recipients go to work as possible, UUS recently released formal guidance on
                   the High Performance Bonus that will award $200 million a year to the states who
                   have the most success in placing people in jobs and ensuring that welfare
                   recipients succeed in jobs once they get them, by remaining employed and seeing
                   their earnings climb over time.

                                                                  Automated Records Management system
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
