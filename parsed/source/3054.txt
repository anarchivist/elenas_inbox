TEXT:
You might want to take a look at a cgse called Church of Latter Day Saints v.
Amos.  It's been a long time since I read it, but I believe the Court held that
exempting a church from general Title VII requirements was permissible, even
though the requirements did not interefere with free exercise.  I don't remember
the reasoning, but it at least suggests that there's some category of
permissible exemptions of religious institutions from generally applicable laws
beyond what's strictly speaking necessary to accommodate religious
requirements.
