TEXT:
How about something like this:
As you all know, the President vetoed the Product Liability Reform Act last
week. The President supports the enactment of product liability reform, but
such reform must be appropriately limited in scope and balanced in application.
~he President could not sign the bill that Congress sent him because it failed
to meet these standards.
Most generally, the President disapproved of the bill's "one-way preemption"
the way the bill would have displaced state law that was more favorable to
consumexs, but deferred to state law that was less so.
The President also opposed, as he stated many times throughout the legislative
process, the complete elimination of joint liability for noneconomic damages and
the capping of punitive damages.   He believes that these provisions would have
undermined the ability of courts to provide appropriate relief to victims of
defective products and thereby endangered the health and safety of the public.
Finally, the President was very disappointed that the Conference moved backward
in certain respects from the Senate version of the bill -- first, in widening
the application and shortening the length of the statute of repose and second,
in applying the bill's limits on damages to "negligent entrustment" suits
 (suits, for example, against a gun dealer who sells a gun to a convicted felon
or a bar owner serves a drink to an obviously inebriated customer) .
The President believes that he and Congress can agree on a product liability
bill -- a bill that protects businesses from frivolous lawsuits, as the same
time as it protects consumers from threats to their safety.   This bill just went
too far in one direction.
