                                       June 20, 1997

Q.   Did the Administration help close the deal?

A.   No. My staff monitored the talks closely so that we would be in a position to evaluate and
     respond to any possible settlement. We consistently told the parties that they would have to
     close an agreement on their own, and they were able to do so without any help from the
     Administration.

Q.   How will you proceed?

A.   I have asked my Domestic Policy Advisor, along with the Secretary of Health and Human
     Services, to undertake a thorough public health review of this agreement. They will consult
     with all interested agencies, members of Congress, and the public health community.

Q.   How long will the review take?

A.   The review will take as long as necessary to conduct a careful analysis, but we will seek to
     work promptly and expeditiously. We expect this to be a matter of weeks, not months.

Q.   Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop have asked in a letter to you that you give them 30 days to
     complete their own review before signing off on anything. Are you going to wait?

A.   I intend to consider closely the views of the public health community, including Drs. Koop
     and Kessler, before rendering any judgment on the settlement. But it is premature to commit
     to any firm timetable for reaching my conclusion.

Q.   What will you look at in evaluating this agreement?

A.   We will evaluate whether this agreement protects the public health -- and particularly the
     health of our children. We will pay special attention to the part of the agreement dealing with
     FDA jurisdiction. The actions the FDA has taken under this Administration forced the
     industry to the bargaining table, and we will insist that the FDA has all necessary authority to
     regulate nicotine and tobacco products. We also will carefully review the financial terms of
     the settlement, including whether the money will go toward protecting the health of our
     children and the general public.

Q.   The final deal limits punitive damages -- a key concession to the tobacco industry.
     Won't you oppose that given your previous opposition to caps on punitive awards?

A.   The limitation on punitive damages for past misconduct is not a deal-breaker for us. We
     understand that the attorneys general extracted substantial concessions from the tobacco
     companies for this limitation, and we will evaluate whether the agreement as a whole
     advances the nation's public health interests.

Q.   Are you taking a political risk in considering approval of this settlement?

A.   This isn't about politics; it's about protecting the public health. We didn't think about politics
     when we took on the tobacco companies last year with our announcement of the FDA rule.

from the harm caused by tobacco products. Two months ago, a court in North Carolina issued a
landmark ruling confirming my decision that the Food and Drug Administration has authority to
regulate tobacco products to protect our children's health. These victories for the public health
drove the tobacco companies to the bargaining table and extracted concessions from them that
would have seemed unimaginable just a short time ago.

       I want to commend the attorneys general and other people working with them, including
children's health leaders, for their hard work in negotiating this proposed agreement. They have
devoted great time and energy to continuing our struggle to protect the health of children, and
they deserve our thanks for doing so.

        We must now carefully consider whether approving this proposed settlement will protect
the public health -- and particularly our children's health -- to the greatest extent possible. Until
now, we have not had the opportunity to review the actual terms of the agreement, and we have
not concluded whether it is in the best interests of the public health. Over the next several weeks,
we will undertake a thorough public health review. I am asking Bruce Reed, my Domestic Policy
Advisor -- along with Donna Shalala, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
-- to engage in extensive consultations with the public health community and to subject this
agreement to the strictest scrutiny. They will report to me on whether this agreement represents
the best means of protecting the nation's public health interests.

       In the meantime, we will fight as hard as ever to ensure that the FDA rule stands. Each
day, 3,000 young people become regular smokers; 1,000 of them will have their lives cut short as
a result. Protecting these children will be our measure of this proposed agreement.
