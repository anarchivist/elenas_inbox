TEXT:
The disparity here is being reduced by a lot -- from 100:1 to 10:1. We're
not going to make anyone particularly happy with this proposal; indeed,
we'll give both sides reason to attack us.   What Justice and ONDCP tried
to do was to come out with the recommendation that would stand the best
chance of actually moving the ball forward on this issue.   It may not get
us the whole way there (though note on the question of what is "the whole
way there" that the President has said many times that he opposes 1:1),
but it stands a ·better chance of getting us part of the way there than
does any other proposal.   Relatedly, it has the great virtue of being
justifiable in solely law enforcement terms because of the match between
25 grams and the usual definition of a mid-level drug dealer.
