TEXT:
Erskine hasn't decided whether he wants to meet with the Texas delegation
yet (he's waiting for Hilley's and Sosnick's advice), so right now all we
can say is that we've received the request and it's under consideration.

Also, I didn't realize that the IDEA action was today. (I thought it was
tomorrow.) We missed the Hill press conference, but we can still issue a
statement.  Should we?
