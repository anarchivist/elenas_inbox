Providers, said this week that he lied about partial birth abortions -- that they're performed more
frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged and that they're often performed on
healthy women with healthy fetuses. ill light of his statements, are you going to change your
position?

Answer: No. My position remains what it has always been -- that so-called partial-birth
abortions should be banned except when they are necessary to save the life of a woman or
prevent serious harm to her health.

Nothing Mr. Fitzsimmons has said conflicts with that position. I've never claimed that partial-
birth abortions are used only to prevent death or serious harm. What I've said is that when the
procedure is necessary for these reasons -- in those few cases when there are tragic circumstances
involving serious harm the woman -- a doctor must be allowed to perform it. But when the
procedure isn't necessary for these reasons, a doctor should not be allowed to perform it.

So I will say again what I've said before: that I will sign a bill banning partial-birth abortions, but
only if it has an exception that will protect those women -- even if few in number -- who need
this procedure to save their lives or prevent serious harm to their health.

    Question: Didn't you base your veto of the partial-birth abortion bill on false infonnation -- i.e.,
    that this procedure is perfonned only on a few hundred women in desperate circumstances?

    Answer: No. I based my veto on the fact that there are a small group of women in desperate
    circumstances who need this procedure in order to save their lives or prevent serious injury to
    their health. I've never said that these are the only circumstances in which the procedure is used.
     Indeed, I've acknowledged that there are cases where the procedure is not necessary for life or
    serious health reasons -- and I've made very clear that I would sign legislation banning the
    procedure in those cases.




    Question: If Congress were to add a health exception to the partial birth bill you vetoed last year,
    that bill would prohibit all partial birth abortions -- including pre-viability partial birth abortions -
    - that aren't done for life or serious health reasons. Are you really saying that you would sign a
    bill of that kind -- a bill that prohibited a particular procedure (except if done for life or serious
    health reasons) in the pre-viability period?

    Answer: I have made very clear my condition for signing the partial birth bill. I told Congress
    that I would sign the bill if it protected women who needed the procedure to save their lives or
    avert serious hann to their health. I implored Congress to send me such a bill. I continue to take
    that position. If Congress adds a provision to the bill that protects women who need the
    procedure for life or serious health reasons, I will sign that bill.
