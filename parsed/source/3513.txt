TEXT:
The striking thing about Cohen's column is that while he criticizes the
President sharply, his position and the President's are very much consistent
with each other.  As you say, the President has said he would prohibit the use
of this procedure where not necessary to save the woman from death or serious
physical injury.  The only thing he has asked for is a tightly confined
exception for these kinds of cases.   (Nor, by the way, has the President made
any representations about how many late-term or partial birth abortions are done
for life/serious health reasons and how many for other reasons.    He hasn't said
that all partial birth abortions are done for life/health reasons -- indeed, he
has acknowledged that not all are. He has said only that those done for
life/serious health reasons must be permitted.)
I guess I'm agnostic as between a call and a letter.   I lean towards the call,
but mostly I think that the two of you should decide.   If we decide on a letter,
I'd be happy to draft or to review.  If we decide on a call, I'd be happy to
participate as needed.
