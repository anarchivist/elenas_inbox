MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                          Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:               DPC Weekly Report

         1. Health Care -- CDC Guidelines for HIV Surveillance: The Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) released draft guidance on Thursday to assist states in designing and
implementing new HIV surveillance and reporting systems. The guidance recommends that
states track people with HIV by name (as states now track people with full-blown AIDS). At
our insistence, however, the guidance also allows states to use so-called unique identifier
codes, rather than names. The"HIV /AIDS community is relieved that the guidance gives states
the option of using identifier codes, but is disappointed that it expresses a preference for using
names. The community believes that names-based reporting jeopardizes confidentiality
and discourages testing; CDC disputes these contentions and argues that name-based
reporting generally leads to more effective surveillance. Members of the AIDS Council
may raise questions about this issue when they meet with you on December 18. You can
respond by indicating strong support for states (like California) that are developing
effective alternatives to name-based reporting.

        2. Health Care -- Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with
Disabilities: Your Task Force on the Employment of Adults with Disabilities will present the
Vice President with its first report on Tuesday. The Task Force will recommend several new
investments (~, the Jeffords-Kennedy Work Incentives Improvement Act), which we are
considering in the context of the budget process; we are fairly confident that the budget will
incorporate enough ofthese recommendations to elicit a positive response from the disabilities
community. In addition, the Task Force will propose a number of administrative actions that
we can implement immediately. For example, the Office of Personnel Man·agement will
develop a plan to increase the representation of adults with disabilities in the federal
workforce, and the Small Business Administration will launch a new outreach campaign
to improve opportunities for adults with disabilities. The Vice President, in accepting the
report, will reiterate the Administration's commitment to passing a strong and
enforceable patients' bill of rights to improve the quality of care for people with
disabilities.

       3. Health Care -- Dean Ornish: Nancy Ann Min DeParle is meeting with Dr.
Ornish today to discuss his proposal for a demonstration project on the cost-effectiveness
of programs like his "Life Style Intervention." Nancy Ann will express support for the


                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

idea, although she will not be able to formally approve it at this meeting. We will stay on
top of this issue in the next few weeks, as HCFA makes decisions about the scope and
financing of the demonstration.

      4. Health Care -- New FDA Commissioner: The Vice President will swear in Dr.
Jane Henney as the new Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration on
Tuesday.

       5. Education -- ESEA Reauthorization: We are working. with the Education
Department to include in our ESEA reauthorization proposal a set of accountability
requirements that are significantly stronger than any in current law. Some of the
proposals under consideration would require states and school districts that receive
funding under the ESEA to (1) take immediate steps to identify and intervene in their
lowest performing schools; (2) phase out the use of unqualified teachers, including those
who are not fully certified or are teaching out of field; (3) phase out the use of
instructional aides as primary instructors, especially in high-poverty schools; and (4)
have effective policies in place (including appropriate supports for students) to prevent
social promotion. We have more to do before we can present you with specific
recommendations, but we believe we will be able to get agreement on a plan that
demands a serious commitment by states and school districts receiving ESEA funds to set
and enforce high standards for schools, teachers, and students.

       6. Education -- National Education Goals Panel: The National Education Goals
Panel released its annual progress report on Thursday. The report highlighted
improvements in school readiness, student achievement in math, and participation of
women and minorities in math and science in higher education. The report, however,
also pointed to apparent backsliding in teacher quality, student achievement in reading,
and student drug use. More generally, the report noted that none ofthe Goals would be
met by 2000. Members of the Panel are now discussing what should happen to the Goals
(and the Panel itself) after that year. Most members still see a need for national
education goals and a bipartisan, intergovernmental panel to report on progress.
Indeed, Senator Bingaman, Governor Hunt, and some members of the business
community are urging that you take a high profile role in renewing the call for national
goals. We and Secretary Riley are concerned, however, that Governor Engler,
Congressman Goodling, and other Republicans would fail to support this effort. We will
try to find out more about the likely Republican reaction and then give you a
recommendation.
       7. Education -- GED Test: You asked at yesterday's budget meeting about the
GED test. We have learned that the American Council on Education (ACE) is
responsible for developing and administering the GED. The ACE is now in the process
of upgrading the test to keep up with rising academic standards, and hopes to unveil a
new version of the test in 2001. We will work with the Education Department on
possible ways to make use of a strengthened GED in our education proposals.

        8. Crime -- Capital Punishment: The Justice Department will release a report on
Sunday showing that 17 states executed 74 prisoners in 1997. This number represents a
substantial increase from 1996, when 45 executions took place; indeed, the 1997 number is the
largest since 1955. The states with the highest number of execution were: Texas (37); Virginia
(9); Missouri (6); Arkansas (4); and Alabama (3). All 74 people executed in 1997 were men.
The report classifies 45 of those executed as white, 27 as black, one as Asian, and one as
American Indian; it further notes that five of the total number were of Hispanic descent.
According to the report, an additional 3,335 individuals are now on death row in 34 states and
the federal prison system -- 1,876 whites, 1,406 blacks, 28 American Indians, 17 Asians, and 8
of other races. This total includes 238 Hispanics and 44 women. Finally, the report notes that
as of November 30, 1998, 18 states had executed 58 inmates, with Texas and Virginia
accounting for half the total (17 and 12 respectively).

           9. Welfare Reform -- Work Participation Rates: We just received (but have not yet
  published) the first work participation statistics from the welfare reform law. The data show
  that 36 ofthe 38 states that were required to meet the law's all-family participation rates in FY
  1997 succeeded in doing so. (The remaining states began implementation ofthe welfare law
  later and need not meet participation rates until FY 1998.) As you recall, these rates require
  states, in the first year of the law's implementation, to ensure that 25 percent of all welfare
  families include an adult who works at least 20 hours each week. (States can get credit toward
  meeting the work participation rates by reducing their case1oads.) Only Nevada and the
  District of Columbia failed to meet this requirement, and even they may give HHS enough
. additional data in the next few weeks to come into compliance. States fared less well,
  however, in meeting the law's separate work participation rates for two-parent families, who
  comprise seven percent of the total caseload. These rates require states to ensure that 75
  percent of two-parent welfare families include an adult who works at least 35 hours per week.
  Only 20 of the 38 states met this strict requirement; the failing states now must enter into
  corrective action plans with HHS to avoid financial penalties.

        10. Welfare Reform -- Teen Birth Trends: A study by the Centers for Disease
Control issued last week provided some new details about the previously reported 15 percent
decline in the national teen birth rate from 1991 to 1997.. The report showed declines in teen
births for all races and ethnic groups and in all states. In addition, the report showed a steep
decline (about 21 percent) in the rate of second births to teens during this period. Second
births currently comprise about one-fifth of total teen births.

        11. Children and Families -- Infant Mortality and Life Expectancy: Another new
study issued by the Centers for Disease Control last week showed positive trends on infant
mortality and life expectancy. The study reported that the u.s. infant mortality rate -- a
measure of the death of babies under one year old -- reached its lowest level ever last year.
The 1997 infant mortality rate was 7.1 deaths per 1,000 births, which is about 3 percent lower
than the 1996 rate of7.3 deaths per 1,000 births. The drop in infant deaths came despite a 7.5



                                                              Automated Records Management system
                                                              Bex-Dump Conversion

percent increase in the number of low birthweight babies and a two percent increase in the
number of births by women late in their childbearing years. In addition, the study reported that
Americans' average life expectancy rose to an all-time high of 76.5 years in 1997. This
increase is due in part to falling death rates from major diseases and from accidents,
homicides, and suicides. For example, deaths from AIDS dropped by 47 percent in 1997. The
most dramatic improvement in life expectancy was among black males, whose expectancy
increased by 1.2 years to 67.3.

       12. Children and Families -- Single Fathers Data: The Census Bureau released
data today showing that the number of single fathers with children at home has
increased 25 percent in the past three years, from 1.7 million to 2.1 million. These men
now account for one in six single parents, joining a total of 9.8 million single mothers.
About 35 percent of all single fathers have never married, while more than half of single
fathers with children under six have not done so. According to the report, single fathers
have higher incomes than single mothers and are more likely to live with another person
(mother, girlfriend, etc.) who helps with child care.

          13. Abortion -- New Abortion Study: The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI)
released a study on Friday showing the lowest nationwide abortion rates since 1975. The
study reports that from 1992 to 1996, the number of abortions performed fell from
1,529,000 to 1,366,000, and the abortion rate decreased from 26 to 23 per 1,000 women
aged 15-44. The report attributed most ofthis decline to effective contraceptive methods,
especially among teen-agers, and a consequent decrease in unintended pregnancies. The
study also reported a sharp decline in the number offacilities providing abortions during
this period, although it suggested that this decline was not a major factor in the lower
abortion rates. The total number of facilities providing abortions decreased 14 percent
between 1992 and 1996, with the greatest decline among hospitals (18 percent decrease)
and physicians' offices (26 percent decrease), rather than clinics (two per.cent decrease).
Less than 10 percent of total abortions are now performed in hospitals and doctors'
offices. Finally, the study examined the prevalence of dilation and extraction procedures
-- i.e., so-called partial birth abortions. According to the report, doctors at 14 hospitals
or clinics performed about 650 of these kinds of abortions in 1996 (out of a total of 1.36
million abortions). The large majority ofthese procedures were performed between 20
and 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

         14. Community Empowerment -- Community Development Financial Institutions
Fund (CDFI): The Treasury Department recently provided the DPC with summary statistics
on the CDFI awards made during the first three years offunding (1996-98). Since its creation,
the CDFI Fund has made a total of 196 awards to 164 institutions. Of the institutions
receiving awards, 139 were already established and 25 were startup. Of the startup
institutions, 9 were full-service financial institutions -- banks, bank holding companies, and
credit unions -- and 16 were more specialized financial institutions such as microenterprise
funds, venture capital funds, and business loan funds.
