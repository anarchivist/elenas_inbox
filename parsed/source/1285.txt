 TEXT:
 It's great.   Just a couple of questions: (1)  Do we really want to raise
 the prospect of a high school test? I think with only six states in hand
 on our initial goal, people would ridicule such a call. And I think the
 President himself will see this as nonresponsive to his demand -- that we
 step up efforts on the challenge we've already put to the American
·people.  In short, I am afraid this will make us look semi-oblivious. We
 should at least delete the first entry under the heading "pushing the
 Policy Envelope;" I think we might remove the fifth (on the Hgher
 Education Act) as well.   (2)  He will remember that we promised him a 4-8
 state event.   If the past is a guide, I'm skeptical that we'll be able to
 pull this off. So I wouldn't make the promise.     (3) Similarly, I'm not
 sure I'd remind him in the last paragraph of the memo that we promised him
 40 states.   Finally, you should proof the whole thing. There are some
 missing words and things here and there, but I didn't bother to keep track
 of where they were (sorry!). Anyway, this is really terrific.
