                            PRESIDENT CLINTON: HELPING PARENTS
                      MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AT HOME AND AT WORK
                                         May 23, 1999

         Today, in a commencement speech at Grambling State University, President Clinton announced
         new steps to help workers meet their responsibilities to their jobs, and their more important
         responsibilities to their families. The President put forward two new proposals to'make leave
         more affordable for American workers. In addition, he released a new report that examines the
         "time crunch" that parents increasingly feel as they struggle to balance their responsibilities at
         home and at work.

         Working to Make Parental Leave More Affordable. A 1996 study by the Commission on
         Family and Medical Leave found that loss of wages was the most significant barrier to parents
         taking advantage of unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child. Today, President
         Clinton directed the Secretary of Labor to propose new regulations and model state legislation to
         enable states to develop innovative ways of using the Unemployment Insurance (VI) system to
         support parents taking leave to care for a newborn or adopted child. Several States recently have
         asked the Administration whether they could use the Ul system for this purpose consistent with
         federal law. The new regulations will authorize this expansion of the Ul system, thereby
         allowing states that wish to use unemployment insurance to assist new parents to put their plans
         into effect.

         Enabling Federal Workers to Take Paid Leave to Care for Sick Family Members. In an
         effort to set an example for all employers, President Clinton also today directed the Office of
         Personnel Management (OPM) to revise its government-wide regulations to allow federal
         employees to use up to 12 weeks of accrued sick leave each year to care for a spouse, son,
         daughter, or parent with a "serious health condition," as that term is defined for the purpose.of
         applying the Family and Medical Leave Act. Currently, the amount of sick leave that can be used
         to care for a family member who is ill is limited to 13 days each year for most federal employees.
         By enabling federal workers to use more of the sick leave they have earned, according to
         conditions established by the FMLA, this measure will remove a significant barrier to caring for
         an ill family member. The President also has directed the OPM to establish an Interagency
         Family Friendly Workplace Working Group to develop, promote, and evaluate federal family-
         friendly workplace initiatives. The President previously has taken other actions to ensure that
         federal government is a model employer, including: allowing federal employees to donate annual
         leave to other employees; expanding flexible family-friendly work arrangements, such as job
         sharing, career part-time employment, alternative work schedules, telecommuting, and satellite
         work locations; and directing improvements in the quality of federally sponsored child care.

         A New Study on the Amount of Time Available for Families. The President released a report
         by his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) today that details the factors that have led to
         decreased amounts oftime available for parents to spend with their children. The report,
         Families and the Labor Market, 1969-1999: Analyzing the "Time Crunch, "demonstrates that
         the increase in hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with the shift toward single-parent
         families, has resulted in families experiencing an average decrease of22 hours a week (14

     '"



          percent) in time that parents spend with their children. The report concludes that the increased
          time at work among parents requires policy-makers to seek new ways to promote strong families,
          including greater flexibility in paid work hours, more affordable child care, better support for
          families with low-wage earning parents, and methods for encouraging two-parent families to
          form and stay together.

          Advancing An Agenda To Help Parents Balance Their Responsibilities At Home And At
          Work. In his balanced budget request, the President put forward a bold agenda to provide
          families with greater tools to meet their responsibilities at home and at work. This agenda
          includes: an historic initiative to make child care better, safer, and more affordable for working
          families; a tripling of our investment in after-school programs through the 21 st Century
          Community Learning Center program; a new tax credit to help Americans struggling with long-
          term care costs; and proposals to expand the Family and Medical Leave law to cover more
          workers and allow leave for more parental activities, including parent-teacher conferences and
          routine doctor's visits.
