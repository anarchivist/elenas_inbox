TEXT:
This seems right to me on fingerprints: a state that decides to go this
route is not changingeligibility standards -- it is enforcing eligibility
standards. But is this also true for drug testing and sanctions? For
example, aren't states adopting a new rule that says that people on drugs
can't get benefits (unless they enter treatment etc.)? Is this a way of
separating fingerprints from the other two? Should we be looking for that
kind of compromise?
