TEXT:
Check in with Cynthia on the draft; she's now checking in with Palast. On
the meeting, I THINK Haskins is going to want it to be very small -- I
suspect the right group is just Bruce, Palast and Tarplin -- but we will
surely let you know if Haskins is open to a bigger group. And on another
subject, there's a note on the way over to you saying that I stand
corrected on FICA -- thanks.
