Diane Regas and I would like to bring you up to date and get your guidance on
next steps in our response to the Advisory Committee Recomendations. We'd like
to meet tomorrow at 2:00 in my office, 222 OEOB. Please RSVP.
(Elena, we're assuming you're picking up Steve's responsibilities on this, but
I'm checking with Kathy Wallman to make sure we have the right person.)
