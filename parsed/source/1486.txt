TEXT:
It's going to be on either Tuesday or Thursday. We have some hopes that
it will be a productive meeting.  As you know, both we and HHS have
indicated to Waters that we have serious policy concerns with her
welfare/grandmothers amendment.  In response, her staff has asked whether
we are interested in discussing other approaches or initiatives for
supporting this group.   We have responded very positively: it would be
great if we could do something else for her in this ~rea, rather than just
reject her proposal.
