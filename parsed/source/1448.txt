TEXT:
You asked last week whether we are supporting the Snowe-Reid bill
requlrlng that insurance companies cover contraceptives.   We do not yet
have a position on the bill, and Chris Jennings and Jen Klein both have
some concerns about it.  For the most part, we have avoided mandating
insurance companies to cover particular services.   (The thinking goes: why
should we require them to cover contraceptives, but not, for example, eye
glasses for children?)  In addition, the bill doesn't reach many people
because it doesn't cover ERISA plans or Medicaid.  That said, the bill
does fit with the President's message to make abortion, safe, legal, and
rare, and we are still looking into this matter.
