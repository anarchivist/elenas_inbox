TEXT:
We are in the process of getting some reactions from DOJ and State to an
options memo, getting a DOJ read on administrative solutions, and doing
some preliminary Hill discussions -- all in preparation for sending a
decision memo to the President. We hope to have everything completed and
the decision memo ready for him by the end of next week, though the Hill
piece might push it back a few days.
