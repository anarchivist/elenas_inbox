TEXT:
In line with our discussion this morning, we should also think about
whether further action on human research is warranted.   Sen. Glenn has a
bill applying the protections now used in federally funded or regulated
research to ALL research.  Elizabeth thinks this might be a good time to
send that bill around for agency comment. And a recent NYT article on the
subject suggested that some changes in requirements for institutional
review boards might be in order.   (Apparently Shays just conducted a
hearing on this issue and expressed some amazement about how easy it is
for a researcher to shop for an IRB that will support her experiment.)
NBAC is supposed to issue some recommendations on this issue in late
summer or early fall, so we should think carefully about whether we want
to do something before then.  But we should at least start thinking about
this issue and whether some action is warrented.
