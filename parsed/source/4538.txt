Subject:         tobacco farmers in the sotu

In the course of the calls last night, it was suggested to me by hill
offices that the potus say something in the sotu, as he did last year,
favorable about the tobacco farmers.   (especially since we are not
including funding for them in the budget this year)   this may already be
in there, but wanted to make a plut for it.   it apparetly went a long way
last year with the tobacco farmers.
