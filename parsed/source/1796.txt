MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                     BRUCE REED
                          CHRIS JENNINGS

SUBJECT:                  Initiative to Reduce Racial Disparities in Health

        To support your race initiative, we have developed proposals that would commit the
nation to an ambitious goal of seeking to eliminate some of the most severe racial disparities in
health care by the year 2010. African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian
Americans suffer from certain diseases up to five times as often as whites. To reduce these
disparities, the government will have to make a sustained effort to find effective approaches and
apply them across all health programs. We recommend that the FY 1999 budget take a two-
pronged approach to this issue by (1) expanding our finest public health programs so that they
can address the problem of reducing these disparities, and (2) funding competitive grants to thirty
communities to test innovative and promising new approaches in this area.

Racial Disparities in Health Care

         The initiative would focus on six of the most severe racial disparities in health care:
infant mortality, cancer, heart disease and stroke, AIDS, immunization, and diabetes. Some of
these disparities are quite startling. For example, infant mortality rates are 2 1/2 times higher for
African-Americans and 11/2 times higher for American Indians and many Hispanic groups than
they are for whites. African-Americans have a 35 percent higher cancer death rate than whites,
and African-Americans under 65 suffer from prostate cancer at nearly twice the rate of whites.
Similarly, Vietnamese women suffer from cervical cancer at nearly five times the rate of whites,
while Latinos have two to three times the rate of stomach cancer. African-American men also
suffer from heart disease at nearly twice the rate of whites. Native Americans suffer from
diabetes at nearly three times the average rate, while African-Americans suffer 70 percent higher
rates. Minorities account for 25 percent of the population yet make up 54 percent of all AIDS
cases. The Demographic changes anticipated over the next decade magnify the importance of
addressing these disparities. As minority populations grow, finding effective ways to close these
gaps will become a critical aspect of improving the overall health of the nation.

Validation

        An initiative that sets the ambitious goal of reducing these health disparities would
receive overwhelming support from public health groups such as the American Public Health
Association, the American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, as well as from
minority groups such as the Intercultural Cancer Council, the American Indian Healthcare


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
Churches.

Proposal

        HHS is proposing to spend $200 million in FY 1999 for this initiative. OMB is currently
recommending an investment of $30 million (along with some retargeting of existing funding
streams), with all the new money to go to established HHS programs, and none to the community
grant proposal discussed below. (OMB believes that most communities do not have the
infrastructure necessary to implement new public health projects in the most efficient manner.)
The DPC believes that a strong initiative will require an additional $100 million, divided
between established HHS programs and the new competitive grant program.

·      Applying Current Effective Public Health Approaches to Eliminate Disparities. Vie
       recommend that you propose $70 million to apply some of our most effective public
       health approaches directly to reducing racial disparities. Our best public health programs
       already use effective prevention and education strategies to improve health care. These
       programs would use additional funds to implement and adapt such proven public health
       strategies to eliminate racial disparities. For example, CDC's breast and cervical cancer
       screening program could use additional dollars to target minority communities better, as
       well as to extend its efforts to other cancers (~, prostate and colorectal)
       disproportionately afflicting minorities.

·      Community Grants to Develop New Strategies to Eliminate Disparities. Eliminating
       racial disparities in health care will require not only the focused application of existing
       knowledge and best practices, but also the development of new approaches. We
       recommend that you propose $30 million in FY 99 to enable thirty communities to
       develop innovative and effective ways to address racial disparities. Each community,
       chosen through a competitive grant process, would commence an intensive program to
       address one of the six health areas. These grants would fund education, outreach, and
       preventive approaches that have not been attempted elsewhere. HHS would hold periodic
       conferences to educate the public health and minority communities about effective
       strategies developed by these communities, with the aim of extending these approaches
       across the nation.

·      Beginning Today to Reduce Disparities. To ensure that we begin this initiative
       immediately, we are identifying ways in which the FY 1998 increases in health care can
       be used to address racial disparities. For example, AIDS education and training centers
       are beginning a new partnership with the Indian Health Service to develop new
       approaches to educate health providers about training and prevention. In addition, the
       National Cancer Institute will expand efforts to recruit more Hispanics into clinical trials.

                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
