MEMORANDUM FOR ERSKINE BOWLES

CC:                      SYLVIA MATHEWS, JOHN PODESTA,
                         DON BAER, ANN LEWIS

FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                         ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                 POTENTIAL MAY AND JUNE EVENTS

        This memo contains a brief description of policy announcements that we expect will be
ready in May and June, along with suggested dates for making them. A number of other ideas
also may be ready for announcement in this timeframe, but we are sufficiently uncertain as not to
include them on this list.

Prior to Mexico Trip                 GTO Announcement
The President can announce a crackdown on narcotics money laundering by expanding the.
Geographic Targeting Order -- a highly successful program requiring financial institutions in
New York to report information about certain cash transmissions to Columbia. The President
would take action to apply these reporting requirements to money transmitters across the nation.

Prior to Mexico Trip                   Food Safety Report
The President can discuss a report issued by the Secretaries ofHHS, USDA, and EPA, in
response to a directive he issued three months ago, proposing steps to improve the safety ofthe
food supply. The report will announce the creation of a new public-private partnership to
educate consumers on food safety. It also will announce a host of new regulatory and research
initiatives, including one to improve methods of detecting hepatitis.

Week of May 5                                CEA Report on Welfare Caseloads
Janet Yellen and Bruce can announce, while the President is in Mexico, the issuance ofa new
CEA report on the decline of welfare caseloads. The report attributes a substantial portion ofthe
decline to the Administration's waiver policies. At the same time, the Administration can
announce $7.5 million in HHS grants to the states to evaluate their waivers.

May 10 Radio Address                          Child Support Announcement
The President can announce (1) the transmittal to Congress of an HHS report showing that child
support collections have increased by 50% in the last four years; (2) Treasury Department action,
in response to a prior Executive Order, seizing certain federal payments that otherwise would
have gone to delinquent parents; and (3) the transmittal to Congress of legislation making it a


                                                                     .         ds Management System

felony to cross state lines to evade child support obligations. The President has indicated that he
would like to do a radio address on this subject.

May 15                                        Law Enforcement Event
At a Peace Officers Memorial event, the President can announce $1.2 million in new money for
scholarships to the children offederal (and perhaps also state and local) law enforcement officers
slain in the line of duty. He also can announce the completion by the National Institute of Justice
of a prototype "smart gun" -- a gun that can be fired only within a certain distance of a wristband
worn by the owner. The gun should protect police officers from being shot by their own guns.

May 17 Radio Address                         State Sign-Ons to Education Tests
The President should be able to announce that a number of new states have signed up for his 4th
and 8th grade testing initiative. We are hoping for a package including Massachusetts, West
Virginia, Missouri, Vermont, and (the grand prize -- but probably the least likely in this
timeframe) New York.

May 18                                        Commencement Address on Science
The President can deliver a major address exploring the ethical questions raised by new scientific
breakthroughs. In addition to anticipating release of the National Bioethics Committee's cloning
report (due the next week), the President should be able to announce new proposed legislation on
genetic screening that would place limits on the use of genetic information by insurance
companies for underwriting purposes.

May 19                                         Education Town Hall
The President can participate in a session with teachers, stU(ients, parents, and others to explain
the standards associated with his 4th and 8th grade tests. The roundtable would demonstrate with
concrete examples the kind of student work -- and the kind of teaching -- that reflects high
standards. Alternatively, the President can go to one of the states that has endorsed our testing
proposal to speak to the legislature. In either case, the President also can sign an Executive
Order designating an advisory council for the testing initiative.

May 20                                       Welfare-to-Work Announcement
The President will meet with Eli Segal and the CEOs of about 25 companies to launch the
Welfare-to-Work Foundation and announce new corporate commitments to hire welfare
recipients.

May 21                                        Mayor's Drug Conference
Ifwe have not announced the GTO expansion prior to this time, we can do it when the President
speaks at this event. Otherwise, the President can announce the issuance of a DOJ/ONDCP
report marking the one-year anniversary of his methamphetamine strategy and calling for follow-
up initiatives. The President also can release a report on his pilot program for drug testing in the
federal criminal justice system, which will describe the success of the program and may call for
its expansion.

May 22                                 Meeting with Mayors on Immigrant Benefits
The President can meet with a group of bipartisan mayors, including Mayors Giuliani and
Riordan, to discuss the effect of the welfare law on legal immigrants and the Administration's
proposal to restore certain benefits. Immigrants affected by the bill also could attend this
meeting, as the President suggested at last week's Hispanic Caucus meeting. This event is, of
course, contingent on the absence of a budget deal.

May 24 Radio Address                            Sex Offender Registry Announcement
The President can announce that the interim National Sex Offender Registration system -- which
he directed the Attorney General to develop in a radio address last summer -- is now up and
running. At the same time, he can announce that he is signing an Executive Order instructing the
Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure that sex offenders released from federal and
military prisons are listed in the national registry.

May 25                                      Receipt of Cloning Report
As noted above, the National Bioethics Advisory Committee is due to release its report on
cloning on this day. We are currently unsure whether the report will conform to the President's
own views regarding this issue. We may want the President to receive the report officially, or at
least to respond to its release.

Sometime in June                            Child Care Announcement
The President can announce that HHS is proposing a regulation on the welfare law's child care
provisions, which includes extending basic health and safety standards to nearly all federally
funded child care.

Sometime in June                             Welfare-to-Work Transportation Event
At an event focusing on the "to" in welfare-to-work, the President can announce pilot grants to
25 states to develop welfare-to-work transportation grants. At the same time, he can promote his
proposal" contained in his NEXTEA bill, to provide $600 million for this purpose.

June 30                                      Turnaround School Event
We are currently exploring whether DeWitt Clinton High School in Brooklyn will postpone its
graduation so the President can address the graduating class of this "turnaround school" on his
education initiatives. The President may be ready to announce a program to help resuscitate
failing schools by providing the funding and assistance necessary to tum them into charter
schools.

July 1                                       Education Standards Event
The President can announce the release of a Department of Education study that will allow, for
the first time, comparisons in math and science achievement between most U.S. states and the 41
countries participating in TIMSS testing. At the same time, the President can report (ifhe has
not done so already, on June 10, at a proposed event for the National Math and Science Teachers

of the Year) on the response to his directive to the Department of Education, NSF, and other
agencies to mobilize resources to improve math and science education.
