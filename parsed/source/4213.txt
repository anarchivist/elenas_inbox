MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                         ELENA KAGAN

SUBJECT:                 RACE POLICY INITIATIVES

        A couple of weeks ago, we sent you a list of policy ideas that could be announced over
the next six months as part of the race initiative. We are attaching that list to this memo. It is
worth noting again that none of these ideas has gone through the budget process, and some are
more fully developed than others. We are continuing work on these policy ideas, and Bruce will
discuss some of them at the meeting tomorrow.

       This memo proposes a framework for these policy initiatives -- an overall message that
makes them (as well as other aspects ofthe initiative) coherent and meaningful. The
communications experts in the White House doubtless can improve on how we convey this
message, assuming you find its substance appealing.

        Very briefly, these policies comprise an opportunity ilgenda, focused on education and
economic empowennent. For the most part, the policies are race-neutral, addressing concerns
felt by working people of all races; but by simple virtue of demographics, the policies provide
disproportionate benefits to members of racial minority groups. Such policies cannot entirely
replace programs using race-based criteria to remedy social inequalities; the need for such
programs, in appropriately narrow circumstances, continues today. Still less can such policies
diminish the need to battle "old-style" (but still too often "new-style") discrimination through
enforcement of civil rights laws. But they represent the best long-tenn hope for improving race
relations and reducing racial disparities -- by encouraging Americans to see their common
interests and values, to forge new alliances, and to move forward together.

         William Julius Wilson made much the same point -- and more eloquently -- in a recent
article. He wrote: "The country's deep racial divisions certainly should not be underestimated,
but the unremitting emphasis on these gaps has obscured the fact that African-Americans, whites,
and other ethnic groups share many concerns, are beset by many similar problems, and have
important values, aspirations, and hopes in common. . . . A new democratic vision ... must find
issues and programs that concern families of all racial and ethnic groups, so that individuals in
these groups can honestly perceive mutual interests and join in a multiracial coalition to move
America forward."

       This is what we should be telling the American people about how best to achieve racial

                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                            2

         progress. This is what should guide us in developing policy initiatives, as well as in promoting
         dialogue. Finally, this is what can stand as your signal contribution in this area: to show
         Americans that they should cut through racial politics, recognize their common interests, and
         pursue policies (e.g., public school reform and an improved housing voucher system) promoting
         opportunity and empowerment for people of all racial backgrounds.




                                                                      Automated Records Management system
                                                                      Hex-Dump Conversion
