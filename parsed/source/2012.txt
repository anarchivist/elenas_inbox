TEXT:
Q: Would an indictment of tobacco industry executives decrease the chance
of Congress passing comprehensive tobacco legislation?

A:  It certainly shouldn't.   The Administration can't comment on a pending
criminal investigation, but efforts to hold the industry accountable for
the harms it has caused should serve as still further impetus for
comprehensive legislation.   We need a substantial price increase, express
confirmation of FDA jurisdiction, and access and advertising restrictions
to reduce youth smoking.   Disclosures of past industry misconduct make it
all the more clear why we need such a comprehensive national solution, and
why we must get it done soon.
