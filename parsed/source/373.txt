Subject:         Possible DC anti-crime/education event

While not of the scale of an event announcing that Bratton is coming in to
fix the DC police, per Bruce's comment last week, I wanted to let you know
of a DC event DOJ is planning that we might want to participate in or
otherwise spotlight.

On March 5, DOJ is planning an event with the DC Public Schools to
highlight peer mediation programs which help kids in the DC schools settle
conflicts without violence.  Students in the program will demonstrate it
for an audience of school principals and corporate representatives, with
the goal of gaining support to expand the program to more schools (I
believe the school system cut the program's funding so it is reliant on
pri va te funds.)

I also understand that DOJ's Office of Justice Program's plans on making
some small Weed and Seed grants for these type of efforts, which we might
be able to announce at this event or at a future one.

I'm sure Steve Silverman would be glad to get more information from DOJ
for you if you were interested.
