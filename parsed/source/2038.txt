Subject:         Re: Tradeable Work Opportunity Tax Credits

You asked what the business would get for trading the credit to the
intermediary: Essentially; it would give the hiring business the ability
to increase the amount it would pay the intermediary for the finding and
training of the new employee.  If Comp'any A would have been willing to
hire WTW employee Ralph who had been through Intermediary B's training and
placement but would have paidB only $2,000, this would supplement the
amount A would be able to pay B, making it more likely B would take a
chance on Ralph in the first place because B can get more $'s from A.
Company A would pay B only after Ralph has stayed at Company A for 6
months.

It encourages intermediaries to train WTW employees. An economist would
say except for lowering the transaction costs, this probably has no
different effect than the employer tax credit, but I bet in the real world
intermediaries would figure out the paperwork and be more efficient at
using this tax credit.
