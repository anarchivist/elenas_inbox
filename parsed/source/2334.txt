TEXT:
What about enhanced penalties for other than telemarketing crimes?    What's
in the federal code now, and what's missing?

Another possibility is to do a directive to the AG referring to some of
the ideas you mention -- both on telemarketing fraud and on other crimes
-- but retaining sufficient flexibility that we can fill in the details
and make additions or subtractions later.  I don't think we need to have
everything nailed down to make this work; asking the ag to come up with an
action plan (say within 60 days) on protecting the elderly against crime,
which addresses (among other things) the proposals you mention, might seem
sufficiently substantive.

What do you think?
