TEXT:
1. Victor Schwartz called to tell me he was sending us another memo on
products reform -- this one dealing more with politics, and less with
substance. During our conversation, he proposed that Jack convene a
meeting that both he (Schwartz) and the new President of ATLA would attend
-- presumably to see if there is any common ground.  I don't see any
reason to do this right now, but it is something to keep in mind.

2.  Per your note, Jack, I told Mark Gittenstein that you would be happy
to meet - - after the transition - - wi·th him and a bunch of high-tech types
interested in securities reform.
