Subject: Meeting re EPA issue



Elena -



Following up on our conversation this morning, the meeting on the EPA

issue

will be at 10:30 am in the Roosevelt Room.    The immediate issues to be

discussed at the meeting are (1) how OIRA handled pre-decisional memos
".
     from

     OSTP and CEA, and (2) how OSTP and CEA should respond to document requests

     from

     Congress.        The larger issue, however, is how the system will work down the

     road; how OIRA will handle policy council       pre-decisional memos concerning

     proposed agency regulations.       This is the portion of the meeting that I

     assume

     will be relevant to DPC.       The meeting has been organized by Bill Marshall

     in

     the Counsel's office and will be led by Sylvia Mathews.        I think Bob Damus

     and

     Sally Katzen will attend along with Michele Jolin, Shelley Fidler, and

     me.    I    Ie

     ft Bill a message this morning suggesting he invite DPC and NEC and got a

     message back saying he had invited NEC.       Perhaps he merely forgot to

     include

     DPC, so even though it's not my meeting, I think I can feel safe in

     inviting

     you or a member of your staff to join the discussion.       Please give me a

     call at

     62735 if you have any questions.



                Jon
I.
