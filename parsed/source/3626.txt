TEXT:
Mark Gittenstein wanted me to let you know that Joe Kennedy's AA (whose
name I didn't catch) might be calling you about securities preemption.
Apparently Kennedy wants to do something on the subject preparatory to a
run at the Governor's seat.  Gittenstein didn't tell the AA to call, but
thinks he might do so and wanted to give you a heads-up.
