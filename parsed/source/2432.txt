TEXT:
We haven't heard much to suggest that any legislation on this subject is
moving.  If it does, I can't believe that it would include a provision on
attorneys' fees.  Although some Republicans doubtless would like this, the
folks who really want this legislation (i.e., the NGA) know that a
provision of this kind would doom the effort.  In any event, we understand
how much of a problem this would be for you.

Subject:         State Medicaid/Tobacco Legislation

I am starting to get calls from our liberal friends expressing concerns
about the Congress waiving the fedl claims to the state settlements.  I
have pretty much told them to forget it, but there is carping out there.

One point that I cannot easily waive off:  fears that the federal release
will be "conditioned" on the states agreeing to limit attorneys fees.
This would be a political problem for us.  Let me know if this is looming.
