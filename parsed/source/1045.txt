TEXT:
Podesta says the President has expressed some skepticism about the new
EEOC guidelines on accommodating workers with mental/psychological
disabilities.  Podesta says this is somewhat sensitive because Mrs. Gore
has come out publicly in favor of the guidelines.  Podesta suggested that
we write a memo to him (not directly to the President) laying out the
situation -- what the guidelines do, what the process was for issuing
them, what is likely to happen now, and whatever else you think
appropriate.  Thanks much.  By the way, in case you haven't dealt with the
EEOC before, I've always found ellen vargas, the general counsel there, to
be fairly helpful.
