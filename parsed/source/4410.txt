MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                   Bruce Reed
                        Elena Kagan

SUBJECT:                DPC Weekly Report

        1. Health Care -- Patients' Bill of Rights Update: Congressional Democrats were
thrilled with the two patients' bill of rights events you held last week. The media gave
these events good coverage, but expressed skepticism about whether Democrats really want
to pass legislation this year. Our best response to these doubts -- regardless of whether we
want legislation or a political issue -- is to remain nonpartisan in tone, as you did in your
remarks. As of now, both the House and the Senate may bring patients' bill of rights
legislation to the floor this week. In the House, the Republican Leadership is attempting to
pass a rule for separate up or down votes on the Republican Task Force bill and the
Dingell/Ganske legislation. Under this scenario, the Task Force bill may pass, but with few
or no Democrats and with a few Republican defectors. The DingelIlGanske bill probably
will receive about 200 votes. In the Senate, the Leadership will allow amendments, as well
as complete substitutes, to the Republican bill; for this reason, the Senate is likely to
produce a stronger bill than the House even though the Senate Republican bill is the
weakest proposal on the table. It is still unclear whether Senators Chafee and Graham will
introduce a bill. If they do, it is likely to have a full set of patient protections and an
enforcement mechanism that is stronger than the limited civil monetary penalties in the
House Republican bill but not as strong as the state-court enforcement option in the
Dingell-Ganske bill. Because of the partisan divide on this issue, this kind of compromise
approach may receive little support.

        2. Health Care -- Nursing Home Enforcement: Senators Grassley and Breaux will
release next week a scathing GAO report on inadequacies in nursing home care across the
country. This report will criticize HCFA sharply for failing to monitor or oversee nursing
home quality. As you know, we have worked with HHS to develop a strong initiative,
including both legislative proposals and administrative actions, to make improvements in
this area. The package provides for criminal background checks on nursing home
workers, strengthened penalties for nursing homes that fail to meet standards, and closer
federal oversight of state enforcement mechanisms. (The briefing memo we sent you
described the initiative more fully.) Your announcement of this package today should
blunt the impact of the GAO report, though it still will receive media attention.

       3. Health Care -- Long Term Care: Congressman Mica, the Chairman of the
Government Oversight Committee with jurisdiction over the Federal Employees Health
Benefits Program (FEHBP), is planning to mark up a bill this week that would allow
federal employees to purchase private long~term care. We have serious concerns about
Mica's proposal, primarily because it does not ensure that the packages offered will be
high-quality. We are developing an alternative proposal on this subject to include in a
broader long-term care package that you can announce later this summer. In the
meantime, OPM will write Mica a letter noting your longstanding interest in this issue
while raising concerns about his proposed policy.

         4. Tobacco -- Meetings with Hatch: Bruce Lindsey, Larry Stein, and we met with
Senators Hatch, Feinstein, Torricelli, and Breaux last week to explore options for moving their
tobacco bill in the Senate. As you know, the bill is based on the June 20th settlement, but with a
slightly higher price and somewhat increased lookbacks. We expressed some concerns about the
FDA provisions in his bill, and noted our fear that the absence of any company-specific lookback
penalties and the scope of the liability provisions -- including not only a liability cap, but also a
prohibition on class actions and punitive damages -- would prevent the bill from gaining strong
Democratic support. Because Torricelli and Feinstein said that a significant number of Senate
Democrats look to Senator Conrad for guidance on this issue, we all agreed to have another
meeting, this time with Conrad in attendance. That meeting will take place on Tuesday
afternoon. Following the principals' meeting, we also sat down with Hatch's staff to discuss
further his FDA proposal. Although we contin.ue to have some differences on this issue, the
meeting went well; there is little reason to think that the FDA issue would stand in the way of a
deal if everything else could be satisfactorily resolved.

        5. Tobacco -- Counteradvertising Campaign: We are exploring with ONDCP whether
to incorporate tobacco counteradvertising in our national youth anti-drug media campaign.
Although ONDCP's $195 million budget must go toward anti-drug ads, we could encourage the
television networks to use some of the matching funds they provide to air anti-tobacco messages.
 Ifwe decide to go down this route, we would work with HHS and public health groups such as
the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids to propose programming ideas and produce specific
advertisements.

         6. Crime -- Values-Based Anti-Crime Initiative: You are scheduled to unveil a new
values-based violence prevention initiative at an event on the South Lawn this Wednesday. The
initiative will support the efforts of community organizations, including faith organizations, to
provide values-based instruction and activities for at-risk youth to improve public safety. Some
of the activities undertaken by the grant recipients, in partnership with law enforcement, schools,
courts, and service providers, include gang intervention, gun abatement, truancy prevention,
mentoring, drug and alcohol abuse, conflict re'solution, and job training. The initiative will
provide grants of between $75,000 and $150,000. The grant recipients are located in 16 cities:
Salinas, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Washington, DC; Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; Indianapolis, IN;

                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

Baltimore, MD; Detroit, MI; Kansas City, MO; Hempstead, NY; Portland, OR; Philadelphia, PA;
Charleston, SC; San Antonio, TX; Richmond, VA; and Seattle, WA.

         7. Crime -- Appropriation for Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative: The Senate
now has joined the House in fully funding your Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. The
new funding will allow us to place additional ATF agents in each of the 27 cities in which the
initiative is now operating; it also may enable us to expand the initiative to other cities.

       8. Education -- Charter School Legislation: The Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee is scheduled to mar~-up a charter schools expansion bill this week.
The bill will contain many of the provisions we have recommended, and has solid
bipartisan support. We will work to convince Democrats to use other bills -- perhaps
including the Ed-Flex bill discussed below -- as a vehicle for forcing votes on other
education priorities, so that we have a chance of moving this bill expeditiously through the
Senate and to conference. In addition, we are planning to release an estimate of charter
school enrollment for the upcoming school year and two Education Department reports --
one on what parents should look for in charter schools, the other on what guidelines
chartering agencies should set -- at your speech to Boys Nation this Friday.

        9. Education -- Ed-Flex Legislation: The Labor and Human Resources Committee
also is scheduled to mark-up a FristlWyden Ed-Flex bill this week. As you know, the 12
states now participating in the Ed-Flex demonstration program have authority to waive
most requirements in the major federally funded elementary and secondary education
programs. The Frist-Wyden bill would give this flexibility to any state meeting specified
requirements. We and the Education Department have worked hard with Frist and
Wyden's staff, as well as with the NGA, to ensure that the preconditions for participation
in Ed-Flex are sufficiently stringent -- i.e.. that states get waiver authority only if they have
in place standards and assessments, school report cards, and procedures for intervening in
failing schools. You announced support for this kind of approach at the last NGA Winter
meeting. Democrats and most of the education community are at best lukewarm to this
bill; even if Senate Democrats support it in committee, they are likely to use it as a vehicle
for trying to move higher priority items, such as our class size reduction initiative.
Republicans also may attempt to use the bill as a vehicle for their favorite proposals -- ~,
vouchers and block grants -- so its ultimate fate is quite uncertain.

        10. Food Safety -- Appropriations Victory: The Senate passed last week, by a vote
of 66-33, an amendment offered by Senator Harkin to restore $68 million for funding of
your food safety initiative. Harkin's amendment funded the increase by requiring the
tobacco industry to take over the administrative costs associated with the USDA's tobacco
program. We worked closely with Harkin and consumer groups to promote the
amendment, and several newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, published strong
editorials in support. We will continue this effort to ensure that we get a good result on this
issue in conference.



                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion


         11. Welfare Reform-- Wellstone Amendment on Work Requirements: As part of its
passage of the Higher Education Act, the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator
Wellstone, by a vote of 55-43, to allow states to count up to two years of vocational education or
college toward the welfare work requirements. States currently can count one year of vocational
education toward the work requirements, subject to a 30% cap on the percentage ofthe caseload
that can count this activity as work; the cap would continue to apply under the Wellstone
proposal. Supporters of the amendment argued that it would help welfare recipients increase
their earning potential and improve the chances of their permanently leaving the welfare system.
Opponents argued that it would weaken the work requirements, which are the lynchpin of the
welfare law and the engine for caseload reduction. We understand that House Republicans will
try to eliminate the Wellstone amendment in conference.

        One possible compromise might be to let college attendance count for up to half of a
person's work requirement (i.e., 10-15 hours) for up to two years. Amended in this way, the law
would expect college students receiving welfare to perform some work, but would recognize the
difficulty of juggling work, classes, and parenting responsibilities. Of course, if the Republicans
succeed in simply knocking out the Wellstone amendment, we will continue our efforts to
encourage states to use the existing flexibility in the welfare law (and in work-study programs) to
accommodate college students.

         12. Welfare Reform -- Illegal Immigrants: HHS will issue a list this week of "federal
public benefits," which illegal immigrants are not eligible to receive under the welfare law. The
list includes adoption assistance and foster care, child care, low-income heating assistance,
Medicare, Medicaid, the Social Services Block Grant, the new Child Health Insurance Program,
and TANF, as well as 20 smaller programs. The list excludes community health centers and
maternal and child health programs, which will continue to be available to all comers. House
Republicans (~, Lamar Smith) may argue that HHS should not have excluded these programs,
but there are good policy reasons and a sound legal basis for doing so. At the same time, DOJ
will issue a proposed rule, instructing providers offederal public benefits on how to determine
whether a potential recipient is an illegal alien. The rule requires a provider to look at documents
for everyone, unless the provider has applied for and received a temporary waiver. Providers will
view this 'requirement as a serious administrative burden, but the law left little room for any
alternative approach.

        13. Abortion -- Congressional Update: A series of contraception- and abortion-related
votes occurred last week in the House, and we expect more next week. First, the House passed
by a vote of224-198 the Lowey'proposal to require health plans participating in the FEHBP to
provide coverage of contraceptives. Second, the House passed by a vote of 276-150 legislation
making it illegal to transport a minor across state lines in order to avoid a state's parental consent
law. Third, a House committee passed an amendment offered by Congressman Istook to require
parental consent for Title X family planning services. We can expect the House to tum this week




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                        5

     to the Partial Birth Abortion Act and the "Mexico City" international family planning
     restrictions.

        .     14. Community Empowerment -- Community Reinvestment Act (CRA): According
     to a report by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC), the private sector has
     pledged more than $1 trillion going forward in loans to distressed communities, with more than
     95 percent of these financial commitments made since 1992. The NCRC also reported that there
     have been 23 times more financial commitments to distressed communities from banks in the
     past 5 Y2 years than in the previous 15 years. In addition, lending commitments under the CRA
     have increased 69-fold from the pre-1993 era -- from an average of $2.6 billion per year between
     1977 and 1992 to about $180 billion per year in the past 5 Y2 years. Despite the success of your
     Administration's reform of CRA, some in Congress are working to attach riders to the Credit
     Union Membership Access Act which would gut the program. Over the next weeks, the NEC,
     DPC, and Treasury will monitor this situation closely.




                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
