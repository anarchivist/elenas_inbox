I am writing to express my views on the House-and Senate-passed versions ofH.R. 800,
the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. As you know, "ED-Flex" authority
permits States to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to
Federal education programs in a manner that complements State educational reform
efforts and promotes achievement to high standards by all students. The Administration
has long supported the concept of expanding ED-Flex authority beyond the 12 States
allowed under current law, so long as that expansion does not undermine the purposes of
those Federal programs and maintains a high degree of accountability for results. I am
very pleased, therefore, that both bills would expand eligibility for ED-Flex status to all
the States, as well as the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
and couple that increased flexibility with a serious attention to maintaining accountability.
at the State and local level. The Senate bill, however, contains certain unacceptable
provisions-unrelated to the expansion of ED-Flex authority-that, if enacted, would
force me to recommend to the President that he disapprove the bill. I urge the Conferees
to avoid such a disappointing and unnecessary result.

Turning to the ED-Flex provisions, I am very pleased that both bills have strong
provisions for ensuring: public notice and comment, at the State and local level, on
proposed waivers; State monitoring oflocal ED-Flex activities; and termination of
waivers that have inadequate or harmful results. With respect to State eligibility for ED-
Flex status, I prefer the more rigorous conditions in the House bill, as they apply'to
implementation of standards and assessments under Title I of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA). With respect to the State's application for
ED-Flex status, I prefer the language in the Senate bill, which focuses on how ED-Flex
authority will assist in implementing the State's comprehensive reform plan. I believe
that complete State reporting of ED-Flex results is important and so support the
provisions of the House bill relating to annual State reporting to the Secretary about the
numbers and characteristics of waivers granted. Finally, I strongly support the provision
of the House bill that would "sunset" this Act upon enactment of the upcoming
reauthorization of the ESEA, because it is vitally important that continuation of ED-Flex
authority be made consistent with changes to the underlying Federal programs to which it
applies.

Last fall, Congress enacted and funded, on a bipartisan basis, a down payment on the
President's plan to help the Nation's school districts reduce class sizes in the early
elementary grades. Regrettably, the Senate bill contains amendments to the class size
reduction authority that would undermine its impact by permitting local school districts to
use funds received under that initiative not to reduce class size, but to meet obligations
they are already required to meet under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act. The value of reducing class size in the early elementary grades is
supported by the research, and doing so is one of the most important things we can do to
honor our national commitment to ensuring equal educational opportunity for all our
children. Moreover, reducing class size in the early grades allows teachers to identify,
and work more effectively with, students who have learning disabilities, thereby

later grades. Rather than undermining the bipartisan effort to reduce class size--and
setting parent against parent in school districts across the country--I would have preferred
a bill that extended the President's initiative, so that school districts could plan to hire
additional qualified teachers, provide additional classrooms, and take the other steps
necessary to reduce class size. I certainly cannot support a bill that contains these Senate
amendments and would recommend that the President disapprove it, if it were presented
to him.

The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is no objection to the
submission of this report and that from the standpoint of the Administration's program,
enactment of H.R. 800 containing the Senate's amendments relating to the class size.
reduction initiative would not be in accord with the President's program. [Or do we want
to say that enactment without the Senate amendments would be in accord with the
President's program?]
