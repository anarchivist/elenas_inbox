TEXT:
1. On the length of the equal protection analysis, I still think we should go
with the compromise I proposed.  But I wouldn't be terribly upset if someone
shortened that yet a little further.
2. On the "caste system" point, Steve has a good point.    (You'll remember that
I didn't defend this language; I just explained it -- and warned that DOJ·might
well resist its removal.)  As noted before, I'd be perfectly content -- e~en
pleased -- to see this language go.
