TEXT:
Attached is a new draft of the Kids EO.   It tries to respond to all of
Treasury's concerns, but for the most part does not use its language.    I
think it's very balanced.   There is a blank space where NEC's views will
go.   We would really like to get this to the staff secy ASAP.  Thanks a
lot for your consideration.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:                  Bruce Reed
                       Gene Sperlng
                       Katie McGinty

SUBJECT:               Executive Order to Protect Children
                       From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks

        You are tentatively scheduled to announce on April 16 an Executive Order
directing agencies to enhance their efforts to protect children from environmental health
and safety risks. Announcement of the Executive Order would immediately precede the
White House Conference on Early Childhood Learning and DeveJopment.

       There is broad consensus among agencies on the policy in the proposed
Executive Order, but three agencies -- Treasury, Commerce, and HHS -- have objected
to the explicit requirement in the order that agencies identify risks to children in the
analysis supporting their major regulations. DPC and CEQ strongly support issuing the
Executive Order in its current form. In addition, all White House offices working on the
Conference on Early Childhood Learning and Development would like you to issue the
order, as part of a set of executive actions showing your commitment to protecting
children. OMB's OIRA (Sally Katzen) weakly endorses the Order, noting that it will
support the Administration's efforts to protect children, but that it also will impose
additional burdens on agencies and result in more stringent regulatory standards over
time. NEC O.

BACKGROUND

        There is a growing body of evidence, highlighted by a 1993 study by the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) on the exposure of children to pesticides, demonstrating
that children are at disproportionate risk from environmental health risks and safety
risks. The report also concludes that federal regulatory standards often fail to consider
these risks fully.
        These disproportionate risks stem from several fundamental differences between
children and adults, in terms of physiology and activity. Children are still developing,
and thus are neurologically and immunologically more susceptible to certain risks.
Children eat, drink and breathe more in proportion to their weight, exposing them to
greater amounts of contamination and pollution for their weight. Children are less able
to protect themselves by use of judgment and skill (e.g. navigating traffic, reading and
following warnings). Concurrent with their recognition of these factors, scientists have



                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
linked to environmental health risks and safety risks. These include childhood cancer,
leukemia, and asthma, as well as childhood deaths and injuries from accidents.

       In many areas, your Administration has taken bold action to respond to the
challenge posed by this new science. Your initiatives resulted in explicit protection for
children in the Food Quality Protection Act and Safe Drinking Water Act; development
of new standards for passive restraints in cars that are more protective of children; and
administrative action to protect children from tobacco, lead, and other hazards. Each of
these initiatives has met with strong popular and congressional support.

       Despite these successes, there is no overall, coordinated approach to children's
issues that highlights their priority, coordinates federal research, and ensures that
federal regulations consistently account for disproportionate risks to children. The
proposed Executive Order, which has been the subject of extensive discussion with
                                                                                       1
affected agencies, would fill this gap with provisions to address each of these areas.

      Policy: The proposed Executive Order requires all agencies to make the
      protection of children a high priority in implementing their statutory
      responsibilities and fulfilling their overall missions.

      Research Coordination: The proposed Executive Order would create an
      interagency Task Force to establish a coordinated research agenda, to identify
      research and other initiatives the Administration will take to advance the
      protection of children's environmental health and safety, and to communicate
      with the public regarding these efforts.

      Federal Regulatory Analysis: Most notably, the proposed Executive Order would,
      for the first time, require agencies to analyze and explain the effects of their rules
      on children. The primary goal of this provision is to link policy decisions to the
      emerging science regarding children's environmental health and safety. This
      provision also ensures accountability to the public and helps agencies to identify
      their research needs. Not surprisingly, given that it imposes regulatory
      requirements, this is the part of the Order to which several agencies have
      objected.

ISSUE FOR DECISION

      I This Executive Order would supercede President Reagan's Executive Order
on Families, replacing it with a policy that better reflects the priorities of your
Administration.




                                            2

                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion
       to explicitly consider risks to children when deciding on major regulations.
       Section 5 of the Executive Order would impose three requirements on agencies
promulgating regulations, if the regulation is economically significant and the agency
has reason to believe that it may have a disproportionate impact on children. Agencies
would have to: 1) evaluate the effects of the planned regulation on children; 2) similarly
assess the effects of reasonably feasible alternatives to the planned regulation; and 3)
explain why the planned regulatory action is preferable to these other options.

Arguments For Inclusion of Section 5

·     Section 5 is the key policy component of the proposed Executive Order, and
      would be an enduring part of your legacy in protecting children's health. It
      makes concrete and gives effect to the overall policy of the Order to identify and
      assess risks to children.

·     Both the National Academy of Sciences and the Administration's own report,
      Investing in our Children, have highlighted the need to link regulatory decisions
      to available data and, where there is a lack of data, to a research agenda.
      Section 5 is the provision of the order that best ensures that agencies will make
      this link.

·     Section 5 provides the structure and enforcement mechanism (through OMB
      oversight) necessary to ensure that agencies adhere to the general policy of the
      Executive Order. Without Section 5, the Executive Order's terms are largely
      hortatory.

·     There is substantial bipartisan support for requiring special regulatory analysis
      with respect to risks to children. The provisions in the proposed Executive Order
      closely track, and broaden application of, provisions in the unanimously-enacted
      Food Quality Protection Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring
      heightened analysis to protect children. This provision will build on the public
      support for giving special consideration to children's health in developing
      standards.

·     Health experts and outside groups, aware of the prior reports and legislation,
      may deride the Executive Order as merely symbolic if Section 5 is omitted.

·     Your previous Executive Order on regulatory review already requires similar
      analysis addressing cost, small business impact, and other issues. Failure to
      include Section 5 may generate criticism that we effectively are subordinating
      children's health to these other concerns.

                                                           Automated Records Management System
                                                           Hex-Dump Conversion



    Arguments Against Inclusion of Section 5

    ·    Section 5 imposes a novel requirement on major rulemakings, with unpredictable
         consequences. The task force created by the proposed Executive Order should
         consider over time and with the benefits of experience the appropriatenesss of
         regulatory standards.
    ·    Requiring agencies to acknowledge that a proposed regulation is not the most
         child-protective is likely to have a distorting effect on regulatory decisions. The
         result will be greater pressure on agencies to "ratchet up" their regulatory
         standards, with a corresponding (and potentially unjustified) increase in the costs
         and burden of regulation. This could undermine the Administration's program of
         regulatory reform.

    ·    There is only limited experience with analyzing regulations in terms of risks to
         children, and this approach is not aways well-received. Critics may cite costly
         Superfund cleanups based on the potential exposure of children to toxic waste
         sites, and analytical flaws in the public health data supporting EPA's recent
         Clean Air Act proposals on ozone and particulate matter.

    ·    In cases where the Section 5 analysis does not prompt agencies to strengthen
         the relevant regulatory standards, it will provide a basis on which to criticize the
         agency's decision. (Some agencies characterize this as a "kick-me"
         requirement.) Requiring this analysis also may strengthen legal challenges to
         agency regulations, as requiring any regulatory analysis does.

    ·    The regulatory resources of many agencies are already stretched thin, and
         blanket application of a new regulatory requirement could divert already tight
         resources and delay ongoing programs.

    ·    Regulatory agencies have made important strides in this area and should have
         the opportunity to demonstrate this progress to the interagency task force before
         any regulatory requirements go into effect.

       The only compromise available is to retain Section 5, but include only the
general requirement that agencies analyze the effects of a proposed regulation on
children. This proposal would delete the explicit requirements that agencies undertake
a comparative analysis and provide a justification for their decision This option would
diminish both the advantages and disadvantages of proceeding with Section 5 as
currently drafted.
