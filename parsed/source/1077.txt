TEXT:
At the residence meeting last week, the President talked about a proposal
of some kind to give a deduction to businesses running child care centers
at a loss. He said there's paper about this around somewhere.   Could one
of you find out what he's talking about and try to get all available
information on the idea? Thanks.
