TEXT:
I just read the new language on worker protections for workfare
participants. Two thoughts:
1. Why should the amount of child support collected and retained by the
state be subtracted from the total of cash assistance and food stamps
before the sum is divided by the minimum wage? I understand that the
state is essentially being reimbursed for this portion of the benefit
payment, but I don't see why that should matter for purposes of
calculating the number of hours the recipient has to work.  Doesn't this
provision on child support threaten to undermine the work requirements
(even at 20 hours) in a way we weren't taking account of on Friday?
2.  It strikes me that unions are never going to be able to organize
workfare participants under this language.  Which, of course, is why
they'll never accept it.
