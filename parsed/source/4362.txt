                       PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON
              REMARKS FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS CAMPAIGN RALLY
                             THE WHITE HOUSE
                                MAY 20,1998

        Nearly 35 years ago -- some two decades before most of the kids here were even born--
the Surgeon General of the United States sounded an alann that has only grown louder, clearer
and more difficult to ignore with every passing year. The warning: Smoking kills.

        And for more than a generation, Americans of all ages and all walks of life have
answered that alarm -- fighting tirelessly to conquer this deadly threat and protect the health of
our people. In the face of some very powerful opposition, our nation has won victories both
large and small -- requiring all cigarette packages to carry warning labels ... prohibiting cigarette
advertising on the airwaves ... banning smoking on domestic flights ... making all federally-
funded facilities that serve children smoke-free.

       Today, we stand on the verge of our greatest triumph yet against the scourge of tobacco --
a triumph that could save millions of our children's lives and become the one of the greatest
public health achievements in the history of our nation.

         This week, the Senate is considering historic comprehensive, bipartisan tobacco
legislation, proposed by Senator McCain and passed overwhelmingly by the Senate Commerce
Committee. I believe this bill is America's best chance to protect the health of our children, to
keep them from ever getting hooked on cigarettes in the first place. I have said I wouid support
any comprehensive, bipartisan bill that meets five principles, and this legislation does so: It
raises the price of cigarettes and penalizes companies that sell to kids; it reaffirms the
FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products; it stops tobacco companies from marketing
to children; it furthers our other public health goals; and it protects tobacco farmers and
their communities.

        Over the past few weeks, my administration has worked with Congress to strengthen this
bill even further -- toughening penalties against tobacco companies who fail to reduce teen
smoking, raising the liability cap on legal damages, protecting Americans from dangerous
second-hand smoke in public buildings.

       I congratulate every child here for taking responsibility for your own health, for saying
"no" to tobacco and "yes" to brighter futures. I wish you well as you make your voices heard on
Capitol Hill. Now it is time for America's elected leaders to do our part.

        The McCain bill is tough, fair, and most of all, it protects our children. It would help
ensure that our children never get roped into lighting up by the Marlboro man, that they never get
lured into smoking by Joe Camel. It ends the unscrupulous marketing campaigns that have

session for as long as it takes to pass this bill. Don't go home until you have given our children
bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco law. They have waited long enough.

        Today, here on the South Lawn, stand America's future. For years, the tobacco
companies have looked upon these children and seen the "replacement smokers" of the 21st
Century. But I see 1,400 unique, irreplaceable children with unlimited potential. I see the
scientists and artists; the teachers and Olympic champions; the engineers and leaders of the 21st
Century. Everyone of us has the responsibility to make sure these and all children across
America have the opportunity to live out their dreams and fulfill their greatest, God-given
potential. That is why we must pass this bill.

        Let the children standing here be the final, triumphant generation of anti-tobacco
activists. And let this Congress be the Congress that saved their lives.
