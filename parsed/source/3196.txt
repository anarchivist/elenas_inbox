Believe ic or not, but there is a lot of activity going on on the
Senate side -- several senators (as in Members themselves as well
as staff) are busy as bees drafting away sections and indeed whole

     bills, many many meetings with the business community, and lots of
     conferences attended by all sorts of "stakeholders".    For some,
     its filling a vacuum while more important people think about the
     budget; for others (like Johnston) its his last chance to JUST DO
     IT!  I keep getting phone calls to see if we want to play,
     participate or negotiate.
     Several of the addressees of this e-mail have more
     important/different things to think about than reg reform, but I
     am increasingly concerned that we are not anywhere near the
     ballfield, let alone part of the action.  Stonewalling and/or
     hoping that this will all blow away may not be the best stately
     now that the second session is started and this thing does not
     seem to have died.

     My proposal is to assemble those of you who still care about this
     issue to talk about where we might go from here and how to get
     there, including specifically getting the agencies together and
     working with us on a collective strategy/substantive approach
     unless, of course, we decide· that we just want to stay the course.
     Those who answer this e-mail will be invited to the meeting, which
     I will schedule for next Tuesday unless someone who responds can't
     make it then.
     Forgive the aggressiveness, but I really believe that we should
     make decisions and not fall into them by default.
