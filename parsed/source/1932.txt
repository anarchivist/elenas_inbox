Subject: Tobacco BUdget and Q&A.

Two items:

1. I heard from a Senate staffer who attended a briefing Jack Lew did on
the budget today that Jack described our proposed tobacco budget as a
"floor." I have been saying it is neither a floor or ceiling, it is the
amount experts tell us is necessary to reach the youth targets.

2. At a meeting yesterday you said our budget contains the same $26B over
5 years for states that was in the 6/20 deal ($4 - $4.5 - $4.5 - $6.5 -
$6.5).  Presenting this fact will provide groups a number to subtract from
the "other uses" and highlight that there may not be the $$ they hoped for
for tobacco control or growers.  On the other hand providing the number
may be reassuring to the states. Your. call.  I wanted to make sure you
focused on it.
