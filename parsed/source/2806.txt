TEXT:
That sounds pretty good, but she doesn't sound like a union member.  You
should see if you can come up with a few options for Monday, and then we
can pick the best.  I talked to Ann Lewis and she agrees with me on my
basic point (i.e., that the panelist should demonstrate the compo woth
problem, not the comp worth legislative solution), although she continues
to want a union member.
