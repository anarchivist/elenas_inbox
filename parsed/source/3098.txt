TEXT:
As I understand it, the decision yesterday adds a little but not a lot to our
other recent litigation decisions stemming from the rescissions act, in terms of
pleasing enviros and commercial fishery interests and displeasing the timber
industry. The decision will be viewed as one more step -- but not a terribly
large or important step -- in the direction we've been going.
I've also been told that there's a very big decision to make next week in
litigation taking place in Kentucy involving salvage timber sales.   I take it we
have to figure out how to articulate the standard we're using in making such
sales.   If you want, I'll let you know when I find out more about this.
