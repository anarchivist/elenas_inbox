TEXT:
I think part of the way to talk about the certification date directive is to use
the situation of a person who already has applied for citizenship. Assumehis
certification date is coming up; he will be cut off from benefits even though
he's just waiting for INS to process his application.' The effect of this
directive could be (as we discussed, we cannot say "would be") to provide him
with benefits for the few months he needs to become naturalized.  Of course, the
directive also applies to aliens who have not applied for or are currently
ineligible for naturalization. But those cases are of course less sympathetic.
Moreover, in those cases the directive only postpones the inevitable cut-off,
whereas in the "immigration pipeline" case discussed above, it serves a real
transitional function.
