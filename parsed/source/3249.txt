TEXT:
I just got an LRM regarding a bill sponsored by susan molinari on (among other
things) trans-racial adoption.   OMB says the bill may be considered by the House
on May 8.  I recall Chris Cerf once telling me that he had done some work on
this issue about a year ago.   Did you reassign this issue to someone else when
you split up Chris's portfolio? If not, do you want to reassign the issue now?
Responses to the LRM are due on Friday.
