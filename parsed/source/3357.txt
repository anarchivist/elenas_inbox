TEXT:
        On July 26, DOJ sent the National Forest Resouce Council (NFRC), which
represents the purchasers with murrelet sales, a draft agreement regarding
replacement timber.  The agreement sets up a process for identifying and
providing relacement timber; in doing so, it makes clear that all such timber
must comply with environmental laws and with the Forest plan's standards and
guidelines.
        On August 1, the NFRC responded that the purchasers "are favorably
inclined to toward the settlement framework outlined in your draft agreement."
The NFRC then went on, however, to provide five pages of detailed comments on
the draft agreement.  Among the most important of the complaints is the absence
of a "drop-dead date" in the draft agreement for the provision of replacement
timber.
        There is obviously some way to go before this controversy gets wrapped
up. But DOJ attorneys have a fair degree of confidence that a seetlement will
in fact be reached.
        I'll let you know of any significant developments.   In the meantime,
please tell me if you would like to see the draft agreement and NFRC response.
