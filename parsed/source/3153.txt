               No version of the Garemendi proposal is free from legal
      difficulties.    But there is a perfectly credible, if not
      necessarily winning, argument that the Administration has
      authority either to use Option 9 timber as replacement timber
      under 2001 (k) (3) (Version 1) or to offer Option 9 timber in
      exchange for other timber recently or soon to be released under
      2001(k) (1) (Version 2).   By contrast, the legal support for
      simply reducing the volume of Option 9 timber by the amount of
      timber released under 2001(k) (Version 3) is much more scanty.
       (For further discussion of these issues, see the DOJ memo
      attached.)
               The legality of the various Garemendi schemes rests largely
      on two sections of the Rescissions Act -- 2001(d) and 2001(k) --
      arId (he relationship between them.   Section 2001(d) -- the Option
      9 sction -- provides that the Administration "shall expeditiously
      pt'epare, offer, and award timber sale contracts" covered by the
      Forest Plan, often referred to as Option 9.    Section 2001 (k) (1)
      .- (he Section 318 section -- provides that the Administration
      shall release all contracts previously offered or awarded in the
      area subject to Section 318 of a prior appropriations bill.      (The
      scope of this provision -- specifically, whether it orders the
      release only of the particular sales referenced in Section 318 or
      of all sales ever awarded in the area covered by that section
      is currently before the Ninth Circuit.)    Section 2001(k) (3)
      provides that if any of the sales under 2001 (k) (1) cannot be
      awarded -- most notably, because of the existence of an
      endangered bird species known as the marbled murrolet -- the
      Administration shall provide the purchaser "an equal volume of
      timber, of like kind and value."
               The question whether the Administration (pursuant to Version
      1) can use Option 9 timber as replacement timber under
      2001(k) (3), should the Administration win the marbled murrolet
      case and thus come under an obligation to provide replacement
      timber, is genuinely difficult. No language in 2001(d) or
      2001lkl specifically prevents the Administration from using
      Option 9 timber as the source of replacement timber.    Nor is
      there any legislative history specifically addressing this issue.
      The Administration, it might be argued, thus has the discretion

     to implement the statute in this way.    (Of course, the Option 9
     timber substituted -- like any other timber substituted -- will
     have to be of equal volume and like kind and value, as required
     by 2001 (k) (3) .) Timber industry lawyers will argue, however,
     that such a scheme subverts the broadest goals of the statute.
     Congress, it will be argued, intended for two sets of sales


     -Option 9 sales and 318 sales - - to go forward as expe'di tiously
     and completely as possible: to use one as substitution for the
     other is a form of double

     -counting that undermines this purpose.


              Reasonable people can disagree as to the strength of these
     arguments.   What is clear is that there is at least a credible
     claim that the Administration has authority to adopt Version 1 of
     the Garamendi proposal.
              The legal analysis relating to Version 2 of the Garamendi
     proposal proceeds in a similar manner, but with one prefatory
     caution.   It is important to note that the Administration has no
     authority to force purchasers of timber released or soon to be
     released under 2001(k) to take Option 9 timber in its place. The
     purchasers of these sales have a property right to them; the most
     the Administration can do is to offer the purchasers the
     opportunity to take Option 9 timber instead.   The ability of the
     Administration to make this offer turns on the same arguments
     discussed above. Again, nothing in the statute or legislative
     history specifically prevents this approach; but the approach
     does undermine the apparent intention of Congress to get out two
     separate sets of timber sales.
              The proposal to reduce Option 9 output by the amount of
     timber released under 2001(k) (Version 3 of the Garamendi plan)
     presents a different set of questions; the legality of such an
     approach is far more dubious.   First, this proposal might be
     thought to violate the specific directive of 2001(d) to award
     Option 9 contracts expeditiously.   Second, the proposal appears
     to violate 2001(1), which prevents any, revisions to land
     management plans, including the President's Forest plan (Option
     9), "because of implementation or impacts" of sales required by
     2001. And even if this action were legal, adopting it might
     invite further challenge to the President's Forest Plan, because
     the action seems to concede that significant new circumstances,
     vitally affecting the Plan, have arisen.
