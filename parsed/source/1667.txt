                   SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE

SUBJECT:                      Initiative to Ensure the Safety of Imported and Domestic Fruits
                        and Vegetables


        As you know, American consumers today enjoy the safest food supply in the world, and I
am proud of the Administration's record in this area. During my Administration, we have taken
significant steps to ensure that we maintain the safest food possible. We have put in place
improved safety standards for meat, poultry, and seafood products, and we have begun the
process of developing enhanced safety standards for fruit and vegetable juices. We have also
expanded research, education, and surveillance activities through coordinated efforts of all
agencies involved in food safety issues. Together, these measures will greatly improve the safety
of the nation's food supply. .

         We need to build on these efforts, and today I ask you to do so by focusing on the safety
of fruits and vegetables. Although the produce Americans eat is very safe, we can and must do
even better, especially at a time when Americans are eating more fruits and vegetables from all
over the world. Last year, 38 percent of the fruit and 12 percent of the vegetables consumed by
Americans came from overseas. We must ensure that fruits and vegetables coming from abroad
are as safe as those produced in the United States, especially as we upgrade our own domestic
standards.

        To help accomplish this task, I plan to ask Congress to enact legislation that will require
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to halt imports of fruits, vegetables, or other food from
any foreign country whose food safety systems and standards are not on par with those of the
United States. This legislation, which will be similar to existing law requiring the USDA to halt
the importation of meat and poultry from such countries, will enable the FDA to prevent the
importation of potentially unsafe foreign produce. In addition, I will provide the necessary funds
in my Fiscal Year 1999 budget to enable the FDA to expand dramatically its international food
inspection force. With this greatly increased ability to inspect food safety conditions abroad and
at points of entry, the FDA will be able to determine when to halt the importation of fruits and
vegetables from foreign countries.

       I also hereby direct two administrative actions that will better ensure the safety of fruits
and vegetables coming from abroad, while continuing to improve the safety of domestic produce.

         First, I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in partnership with the
Secretary of Agriculture and in close cooperation with the agricultural community, to issue
within one year guidance on good agricultural practices and good manufacturing practices for
fruits and vegetables. This guidance should address ways to prevent potential sources of
contamination, should take into account differences in both crops and regions, and should
address food safety issues throughout the food production and distribution system. By providing
the first-ever specific safety standards for fruits and vegetables, the guidance will improve the


                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion
To ensure that this guidance has the widest possible effect, I also direct the development of
coordinated outreach and educational activities.

        Second, I direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of
Agriculture, to report back to me within 90 days with a status report and complete schedule for
the good agricultural and manufacturing practices, and a plan on how to improve the monitoring
of agricultural and manufacturing practices abroad, to assist foreign countries to improve those
practices where necessary, and to prevent the importation of unsafe produce, including by
detecting unsafe food at the dock or border. I especially urge you to consider the best ways to
target inspection and testing toward those areas where problems are most likely to occur.

        In addition to taking these actions, you should accelerate whatever food safety research is
necessary to support them. These steps, taken together and in coordination with the legislation I
will send to Congress, will improve the safety of fruits and vegetables for all Americans. I also
will direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Secretary of Labor
and other necessary agencies to provide you with assistance in achieving this goal.
