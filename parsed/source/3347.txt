I am trying to wrap up the DEA and Border Patrol testimony for the
July 31, 1996, Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Drug
Smuggling on the Southwest Border (circulated yesterday under
LRM's #5222 and 5223, with comments due by noon today).   If I do
not hear from you by 2:30pm I will assume that you have no
objections to the testimony.
Also - soon you will be receiving the ONDCP testimony for this
same hearing with comments due by 5pm today.
Thanks
