Yo Bruce -- by not cc'ing me, you're just making your staff do extra
work.  (But they do seem to be getting pretty well trained.)

I don't mind attacks from Bob and Wendell; that will help.  I need to sit

We should look at the blue dog bill and see if we can live with it.
They're giving mayors 20% of the money.
