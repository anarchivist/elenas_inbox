                Crime -- Final 1997 FBI Crime Statistics: The FBI will release on Sunday the final
        1997 Uniform Crime Report (UCR), which will show that crime decreased by two percent
        between 1996 and 1997. Murder, rape, robbery, assault, and even juvenile crime dropped, and
        every region of the country reported an overall decline. The decrease in crime is the sixth in a
        row, with a total decline of seven percent since 1993.

           (1) Violent Crime: Violent crime fell three percent between 1996 and 1997, with all
           categories of violent crime declining in both volume and rate. The number of murders fell
           seven percent during the year (26 percent since 1993), and the murder rate hit its lowest point
           in 30 years. About 77 percent of murder victims and 90 percent of murder offenders were
           male. About 48 percent of murder victims and 45 percent of murder offenders were white;
           about 49 percent of murder viCtims and 53 percent of murder offenders were black. Nearly
           half (48 percent) of murder victims knew their assailants; among female murder victims, 29
           percent were killed by husbands or boyfriends. In addition, rapes declined by one percent,
           robberies by seven percent, and aggravated assaults by one percent.

           (2) Property Crime: Property crime fell two percent between 1996 and 1997, with all
           categories of property crime decreasing in both volume and rate. Burglaries and larceny-theft
           declined by two percent each; motor vehicle theft declined by three percent; and arson
           offenses declined by seven percent.

           (3) Hate Crime: A total of 9,861 hate crimes were reported in 1993, with 5,898 motivated by
           racial bias; 1,483 by religious bias; 1,375 by sexual-orientation bias; 1,083 by ethnic bias;
           and 12 by disability bias. Crimes against persons were 70 percent of the total number of hate
           crimes reported. About 55 percent of these crimes against persons were threats or other kinds
           of intimidation; 26 percent were simple assaults; 18 percent were aggravated assaults; and
           less than one percent were rapes and murders.

           (4) Juveniles. Juvenile arrests for violent crime dropped four percent between 1996 and
           1997 -- the third annual decline in a row. Juvenile arrests for murder dropped a full 16
           percent.
