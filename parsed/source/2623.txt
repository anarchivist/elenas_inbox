1. I don't know.   I assume advocates don't trust state Medicaid agencies
and HCFA to enforce beneficiary rights and want the leverage of the
consitutional cause of action.   But I don't know that there's a big
distinction between Medicare and Medicaid in that regard.

        2. I told Kneedler we'd like to see stripped-down version by
tomorrow morning.   I'll call back and emphasize as early as possible.
He is, as you might expect, unenthusiastic and emphasizes that we must   at
least say 9th Circuit wrong. on state action and a little bit of why.

Why, then, is everyone so insistent about the need for section 1983
actions in medicaid?

And when are we going to see a stripped-down version of the brief?
