As you know, i disagree with the thrust of this memo, though i wouldn't
object to the "nothing in this act" language.  Have we heard anything from
HHS?

Subject:         Crime Bill -- Nursing Home Provision

HD staff have reviewed Section 3039 of the Crime Bill ("Nursing Home
Resident Protection Act") and have the following comments:

Inclusion in Crime Bill. As a matter of perception, we believe there is a
danger in housing a nursing home quality provision in the crime bill.
Nursing home resident advocates have raised concerns that nursing home
enforcement should, in general, be a quality issue, not a crime issue. We
recommend pulling the nursing home provision out of the crime bill and
sending it up as a stand-alone bill.

Criminal Authority for DOJ.  We concur with the provisions in the bill
that would give DOJ criminal authority over both nursing home chains and
individual nursing homes.

Referral. The bill would give DOJ the authority to pursue nursing homes
without referral from HCFA.  We believe this would create significant
overlap between HCFA's and DOJ's enforcement actions and could impede
HCFA's actions to improve quality. We are also concerned that, because
DOJ would exercise its authority through its us Attorney's offices, there
would not be a consistent application of quality standards.  We recommend
that DOJ have the authority to pursue nursing homes only upon referral
from HCFA or with the explicit approval of HCFA.   We believe these
provisions should be included as part of the actual bill, rather than as
an MOU.

Chains vs. Individual Facilities. The bill would give DOJ civil authority
to pursue both nursing home chains and individual facilities.  We believe
HCFA should have primary civil authority in cases involving individual
facilities, and we recommend removing the legislative language that gives
DOJ civil authority over individual facilities.  DOJ would continue to
have civil authority through the False Claims Act, upon referral from
HCFA.  DOJ's proposal would impede HCFA's ability to enforce quality
through CMPs, including the use of HCFA's new CMP per-instance CMP
authority.  For nursing home chains, we believe DOJ should have civil
authority to pursue nursing home chains only upon referral from HCFA or
with the explicit approval of HCFA.

Protecting Enforcement of Quality. The bill provides no assurance that
HCFA will be allowed to continue quality enforcement actions even if DOJ
is conducting its own investigation. We believe HCFA should be able to
continue its enforcement actions even if DOJ is conducting its own investig
ation.  We recommend including language stating that "Nothing in this Act
shall be construed as depriving the Secretary of Health and Human Services
of any authority, including enforcement authorities, under the Social
Security Act, related to nursing homes."

As you know, negotiations among policy officials at HHS, HCFA, DOJ, OMB
and DPC are ongoing. We understand that there is a tentative agreement
between HCFA and DOJ that would give HCFA veto authority over injunctive
relief cases brought by DOJ in exchange for giving DOJ civil authority
over individual nursing homes, with required advance consultation with
HCFA.

We suggest two possible alternatives:

Accept this compromise as is, but insert language stating that "Nothing in
this Act shall be construed as depriving the Secretary of Health and Human
Services of any authority, including enforcement authorities, under the
Social Security Act, related to nursing homes." This would protect HCFA's
efforts to enforce quality even if DOJ is conducting its own investigation.

Give all primary civil authority to HCFA, but establish a referral process
in an MOU for both chains and individual facilities.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
