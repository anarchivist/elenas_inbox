      TEXT:
      Justice has just submitted for "instantaneous" clearance a brief
      statement, the text of which is below, on an amendment to be
      offered by Rep. Deutsch to the Commerce-Justice-State
      appropriations bill, which is now being debated on the House
      floor.   Please give me any comments by 3:15 p.m. Thank you.
      Background
      The Deutsch amendment would reduce by 10 percent certain Federal
      law enforcement grants to State and local entities that fail to
      provide public safety officers who retire or are separated due to
      certain injuries suffered in the line of duty "the same or better
      level of health insurance benefits" as were paid at the time of
      retirement or separation.
      The statement was prepared at the request of Barbara Chow in
      WH/LA.   Justice is checking with Barbara to see if she wants the
      following text formatted into a letter from Justice to the
      appropriators.

        Text of Justice Statement
        "The Administration fully supports the goal of maintaining
        adequate health insurance coverage for law enforcement officers
        injured and disabled in the line of duty.   Indeed, it supports
        ensuring that all Americans have sufficient health insurance.
        "We must work to ensure the goal of providing insurance for
        injured law enforcement personnel while not imposing large
        financial burdens and unfunded mandates on state and local
        governments.  We must also work towards the goal of proper
        coverage while not threatening essential crime fighting funds
        needed by state and local law enforcement such as the Byrne grants
        program, the Violence Against Women funds and the COPS program.
        "We would be happy to work with the sponsor of the amendment and
        all concerned to meet this need· in the most effective way
        possible."
