Subject:         Possible message events during POTUS vacation

Elena -- Ann asked me to try to get a sense of things that could be
announced, released, etc. during the POTUS' s vacat·ion - - reports that
Cabinet could release, things of that sort.

Is someone in your shop able to compile such a list or memo for me or Ann?

Many thanks,

Eli
