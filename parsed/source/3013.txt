TEXT:
As you no doubt know by now, the letter to Davis ended up going to Wilson as
well. Because of that decision,which Barry Toiv informed me of, I took out some
of the stuff early on that referred specifically to Davis. Toiv put in the
phrase "in order to apply with all applicable law."   Emerson added the sentence
saying that the Chief of Staff had instructed you to work with the UC system in
solving any problems.   (James and I discussed paging you on the golf course for
this and decided not to.)   Panetta read it and much to Toiv's surprise, changed
nothing.  I think I do a fairly good Abner J. Mikva signature.
