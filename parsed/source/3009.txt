TEXT:
So, here are some ideas about how to keep me amused (and also make some good use
of me) :
1. Now that Chris Edley is leaving (has left?), is there a need for someone to
keep on top of the affirmative action issue -- for example, by working with
Justice on its review of all affirmative action programs? I know the issue well
(because I teach it) and care· about it a lot; if there's stuff to do here, I'd
love to do it.
2.  I note that in addition to the supposed handshake creating a birpartisan
commission, the Senate recently approved a resolution to consider campaign
finance legislation in this Congress.   Is there stuff going on in the White
House on this issue? Involving whom? Is there a way for me to get involved?
***
Of course, if this memo prompts you to come up with other ideas, I'd love to
hear them. But I know you have better things to do than sit around all day
trying to figure out what I can do with myself.  So I just thought I'd give you
some ideas of my own.
