TEXT:
We should make sure we're fully comfortable with the substance because (1)
not much is likely to change between the guidance and the reg and (2)
we're never going to have better leverage.  I'm still where I was --
wanting to know the answer to the workfare question (though not sure how I
feel about it) and skeptical about the earnings gain measure.  But I don't
at all have strong views.  What's your recommendation?
