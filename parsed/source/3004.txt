TEXT:
Sorry I didn't get back to you; I was at the Waco hearing all day (and night).
I actually think the old. paragraph was better.   Here's why.  (1) Even under Roe,
I do not think courts would have automatically equated fetal deformities with
harm to maternal health.   (2)   The Schroeder bill also does not equate the two.
It seems to apply only when fetal deformity itself endangers women's health;
perhaps there is a presumption that this will always be the case, but this
presumption is not spelled out.    (3) Related to the above but more generally, I
think in this paragraph you equate the two too much.    For some women, all fetal
deformities will pose a threat to maternal health; for other women, some will;
for other women, none will.    I don't think any court, now or before Casey,
automatically would have equated the two.
What have other people said about the memo generally?
