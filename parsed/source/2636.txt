Maria --

For the record, I've tried to meet with Mike Smith to discuss the ESEA
issues. He cancelled once, and his secretary now reports that he's too busy
because of testimony, etc.

I'm not complaining. I'm just registering my good faith efforts.

My recommendation is that you just figure this out when the whole draft is
complete. I'm actually kind of relieved not to have the scheduling
pressure.
