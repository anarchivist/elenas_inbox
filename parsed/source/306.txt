TEXT:
On the flex bill, it will be me and a staff member (perhaps Paul
Weinstein).  I guess one question is whether you want to include OMB; I
defer to you on that.

On the strategy meeting, it will be me and Bruce. You should let us know
what you think makes sensere other participants, agenda items, and so
forth.
