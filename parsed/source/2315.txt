In a recent report, I read that the NY Times is working on a story about
the settlement agreement with the Indianapolis public schools that ended
busing--Eddie, you'll remember we had received several passionate pleas
from advocates complaining that DOJ was abandoning the goal of integration
with this settlement--seems to me someone should find out from OCR what is
being said and if what doj  is saying is in keeping with the President's
statements on PBS last week about the value of diversity and integratio
n--thurgood, can you find out what reporter is working on this--By the
way,I am not advocating that the White House get in the story--I just
think we should know the focus in light of the Race Initiative.
