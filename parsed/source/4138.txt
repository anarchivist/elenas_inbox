TEXT:
We are in a fight for our lives on the testing initiative, with Congress
likely to vote in early September to prohibit the use of federal funds for
the test. We cannot waste Sept 8 on a sweetness-and-light literacy
event. We're all going to have to work together to make this problem
disappear.  Let's talk about how best to do so.  Thanks.
