You're way ahead of me.  That's great.   On the dates: we agree that there
are dangers of seeming a johnny-corne-lately.  But especially if we want to
link up the conference with real policy initiatives, there are also
dangers of going ahead before we're really ready. We've been getting that
message from a bunch of cabinet secretaries, and I think Bruce wants at
least to reopen this question. Talk to you soon.
