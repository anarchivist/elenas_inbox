TEXT:
1. chief state school officers is on for the 17th.
2. the schedulers are dubious about whether they can fit in an event sat.
morning.  don and i agreed that if they can't, we should at least revisit
the "weekend package."
3. Gene thinks doing the medicare fraud package in this way (even with an
event) is a wa·ste. He thinks we can make a much bigger deal out of it by
doing something that will take on the ama. He said this to me alone, but
loud enough so that don heard and opined that "the policy people should
get it together."
4. People are still talking about the VP announcing the welfare/govt
workers directive.   I said we didn't think that made much sense.   Don said
that he thought the VP wanted to do it.   The VP's office had no comment.
5. The Pres will recognize the Teacher of the Year on April 14.     (We
obviously should try figuring out an announcement for this.)
6. The Pres is going to do a tobacco related event on April 15. Don is
keen on the internet idea.
7. The Pres could make a keynote address at the VP's empowerment conf on
April 16. Don said he thought we should only do this if the speech really
said something.   Gene said he'd think about what kind of announcement
would be appropriate for this speech. He mentioned education.     We should
do this jointly, though I didn't say anything.
8. The schedulers proposed April 9 as a date the Pres could participate
in a memorial service for al shanker. They asked for our help in hooking
up with the AFT on this, and I volunteered Mike's services.
