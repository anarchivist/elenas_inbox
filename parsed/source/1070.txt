TEXT:
This is the memo sylvia got back from mike after she forwarded my memo
saying that we should not yet announce his nomination (or our intent to
nominate him).  My memo said that some of his writings might be
controversial, that we hadn't finished reviewing them yet, and that we
weren't prepared to start answering questions.   It seems to me that's
still the right answer.

Subject:         Re: satcher

we have gotten nothing but green lights in suggesting that satcher is our
nominee.  we have confirmed on background to numerous news organizations.
if there is a problem, we need to know right away since we are way out
there.
