 TEXT:
 I guess I have a reaction, which is that we're making the President look
 like a liar. Who's been giving the legal advice? Education? Justice?
 Is our own counsel's office involved?    (If not, it should be.)  It seems
 to me that we have to give people a very strong signal that we need to
.find some way of including people who are doing service activities under
 the auspices of church programs.   (You should show them what the President
 said.) At the very least, we should be able to include participants in p
 rograms that aren't "pervasively sectarian."   But don't suggest this as a
 solution -- it would be nice to find language that stretches the envelope
 still further.
