TEXT:
I tried to call you to say I was sorry -- I certainly hadn't meant to suggest
 (though apparently I did) that you weren't completely up-to-date with OMB as to
the White House plan.   I only thought there might be a question as to whether to
provide that plan to Congress, given the lack of specificity in its request.   I
take it from what you've said that there's not. Again, I'm sorry for the
miscommunication.
