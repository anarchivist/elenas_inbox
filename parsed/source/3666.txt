One suggested change:

        the brady sentence now reads:  "that extends the Brady Bill so
violent teenage criminals will not be able to buy handguns."

        Teenagers are already prohibited from buying handguns.   The Youth
Handgun Safety Act in the 1994 Crime Bill made it illegal for anyone under
18 to have a gun. (w/ certain hunting, parent, etc. exceptions).

        What the provision in the Gang Bill would do is lead to a
background check on juvenile records --   if the potential gun buyer
committed a violent offense as a juvenile, it will now show up on the
Brady check.

                 I think this sentence can be easily fixed by changing "not" to
11   never . "
