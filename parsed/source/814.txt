TEXT:
Do you think a meeting with treasury makes sense? something small, with
us, ken, emily, treasury representation, and perhaps one rep. apiece from
hhs, ag, and labor? Let me know if you think it makes sense to do
tomorrow.  If so, give a list of people to laura, and she can set up the
meeting.
