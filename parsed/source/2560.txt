TEXT:
We took a major hit in the budget on this issue (with a bipartisan
coalition in Congress insisting that we delay our rule for a year). Also,
since Livingston is one of the major opponents of our position, I can't
imagine we're going to do better this year.  So it doesn't strike me that
there's much to say.  Chris, am I wrong?
