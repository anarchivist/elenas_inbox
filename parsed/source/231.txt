TEXT:
Attached is a new version of the 0-3 memo.  Nicole or Pauline: Please
check it with Melanne, if you think she would want to see it.   Note also
the new time for the meeting.  Could whoever arranged for the room before
check if it is available at the new time?  Finally, does one of you have
the latest draft of the e-o, either in hard copy or on your e-mail
someplace? I'm sure I should, but I can't seem to find it.    Thanks.

MEMORANDUM FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS

FROM:          BRUCE REED
               Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

               ELENA KAGAN
               Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy

SUBJECT:       Formation ofInteragency Working Group on Early Childhood Development


        As the President announced in his State of the Union Address, he and the First Lady will
hold a White House Conference on Early Learning and the Brain this Spring. In conjunction
with this Conference, and in light of recent scientific research on neurological development, the
Administration will engage in a broad-based review of policy affecting our youngest children.
As this review goes forward, the Administration will highlight ongoing and new initiatives to
support these children and their families.

        To initiate this effort, the President will issue an executive memorandum asking each
agency to identify policies and proposals to enhance early childhood development. This
memorandum also will call for the formation of a senior level interagency working group to
share, examine, and develop these plans. Attached is a draft ofthis memorandum.

        We will hold the first meeting of this working group on Friday, February 14, from 1:30-
2:30 p.m. in Room 180 of the Old Executive Office Building. We would like you to designate a
Presidential appointee to join this working group and attend this meeting. Because the President
wishes to issue the executive memorandum shortly after this meeting, your designee should
provide any comments you have on the memorandum before or at the meeting. In addition,
designees should bring with them a list of the three to five programs or initiatives relating to
early childhood development that your agency, at this early stage in the process, would most like
to highlight. Given the Administration's commitment to a balanced budget and fiscal discipline,
each agency should indicate the level of new funding, if any, these initiatives would require.

       Please feel free to contact either of us with any questions.
