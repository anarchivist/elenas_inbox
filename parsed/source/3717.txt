 Question:    Isn't it hypocritical to keep calling for campaign finance reform when you
              continue to attend Democratic fundraisers?

 Answer:      We have challenged the Republican party to join with the Democratic party to
              voluntarily restrict soft money contributions. Already the Democratic National
              Committee has agreed to my request to unilaterally stop taking money from non-
              citizens and to limit large soft money contributions. However, I believe it is
              unfair for the Democratic party to go any further to unilaterally disarm in the face
              of the Republican party's absolute refusal to voluntarily restrict their fundraising
              III anyway.


 Question:    Given that you have made campaign finance reform a top priority for your second
              term, why didn't you raise passage of reform legislation during the bipartisan
              leadership meeting two weeks ago?                              .

 Answer:      The fact is that I did raise campaign finance reform as one of my priorities during
              that meeting. We agreed during the meeting that the bipartisan priorities would
              include those issues, such as the balanced budget, juvenile justice reform and
              uthers, that would gamer widespread bipartisan support and could move quickly.
              It is clear to me that there is still a lot of debate on the Hill about the right way to
              reform the campaign finance system.

. Question:   What actions have you taken to ensure that campaign finance reform is enacted
              by your July 4th deadline?

Answer:       We are making every effort to ensure that bipartisan reform passes by July 4.
              I have had meetings at the White House with the lead sponsors of bipartisan
              reform -- Senators McCain and Feingold and Representatives Shays and Meehan
              and I have also met with the House sponsors of the legislation. As I have done
              with other issues that I have designated as a priority, such as the crime bill and
              welfare reform, I have appointed several senior White House officials to lead our
              effort to pass McCain Feingold/Shays Meehan. They have met on several
              occasions with outside reform groups and are working closely with hill staff on
              ways to ensure that the legislation is enacted by July 4. In addition, we will
              shortly announce a significant initiative to build grassroots support across the
              country for passage of real campaign finance reform.

Question:   How are you going to move people from welfare to work when there are no jobs?

Answer:     I believe jobs are available and I expect the welfare rolls to continue to decline.
            Minimum wage jobs have always been open, but the package of welfare benefits
            previously available offered more to recipients than a minimum wage job. Now,
            with increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit, child care subsidies, and other
            provisions that makes work pay, welfare recipients can afford to take those
            available minimum wage jobs. Once working, fonner welfare recipients will gain
            the employment experience necessary to move up the ladder of work.

            But, we will need more jobs -- and jobs that pay more than the minimum wage if
            we are ensure the success of the new welfare law. I believe that a combination of
            private sector commitments, such as those made by the CEOs with whom I
            recently met, economic development, tax credits, additional welfare-to-work
            funds, and a focus on jobs in the growing technology industry will create the new,
            higher paying jobs we need.


Question:   During your State of the Union address) you announced that five prominent
            CEOs had joined the effort ·to help move weltarerecipients to work. However,
            recent press stories indicate that these companies have done litde to date to actually
            hire weltare recipients. Can you comment?

Answer.     During my State of the Union address, I was very pleased to announce that five of
            this country's major corporations had pledged to work with me in the effort to
            move welfare recipients permanently into the workforce. These five companies
            had pledged to take a leadership role in the welfare-to-work effort during a
            meeting I held earlier this year with a larger number of CEOs. These are not
            necessarily companies that have programs up and running; in fact, most of them
            don't. They are companies that have made a serious commitment·· and that I'm
            confident will live up to that commitment -. to develop programs and initiatives to
            get people off the welfare rolls and into real jobs.


Question:   What has the White House done to hire welfare recipients since the new welfare
            law was signed?

Answer:     Just last week, the Director of the U.S. Office for Personnel Management
            submitted a report to the White House outlining several options the Federal
            Government might pursue to hire welfare recipients. He and his staff came up
            with some very good ideas and I am currently reviewing those ideas. I hope to
            have something to announce very soon.

government generally. We will also work hard, based on the steps we take in the federal
government as a whole, to open up opportunities for welfare recipients at the White
House.

Question:     The new welfare law cuts off food stamps after three months for
              unemployed non-disabled adults, and allows the Department of
              Agriculture to exempt areas with high unemployment. Why does the
              Administration want to give food stamp benefits to men and women who
              refuse to work?             .

Answer:       Enacting the welfare law was an historic accomplishment that represents
              a significant step forward in social policy for this country. However, as I
              said when I signed this bill, several provisions of the law have nothing to
              do with the goal of welfare reform -- putting people to work. Instead, they
              cut back on our vital food safety net and are unfair to immigrants who
              have entered this country legally.

              I strongly support work requirements. But the welfare law's harsh and
              unreasonable time limit of 3 months in 36 cuts off people who want to work but
              can't find jobs. In my budget, I proposed an alternative: a real and tough work
              requirement without arbitrary cut-offs.

              Under my proposal, those who refused to work or refused to take advantage of a
              work opportunity would face tough new penalties. We would limit food stamps to
              6 months out of 12. This policy would encourage work while giving those out of
              work the transitory help they need to get back on their feet. We proposed new
              funding and a wage supplementation option to expand the number of work slots
              available to this group by nearly 400,000 over five years. I am looking forward to
              working with Congress to enact this sensible proposal.

Background:
·    As of March 1, states will begin to cut offfood stamp benefits for people who have not
     met the new work requirement in the welfare law.

·      Under the law, able-bodied childless adults between the ages of 18-50 are not permitted
       to get food stamps for more than 3 months in a 3-year period, unless they are working at
       least 20 hours a week.

·      USDA can waive the work requirement in cities or counties with high unemployment. To
       date, USDA has granted waivers to 23 states that exempt specified counties or cities with
       high unemployment.           .

·      Despite these exemptions, 600,000 individuals will lose their food stamp
       eligibility in FY98 due to this provision. Under the Administration's proposal,
       approximately 35,000 individuals would lose eligibility in FY98. Unlike the
       welfare law, the Administration's proposal targets tough sanctions at those
       individuals who are unwilling to work and to play by the rules.

Question:   Immigrants shouldn't be coming to the US, to get on welfare, Why is the
            Administration making restoration of these benefits a priority?

Answer:     I believe that legal immigrants should have the same opportunity, and
            bear the same responsibility, as other members of our society, The
            welfare law denies most legal immigrants access to fundamental safety
            net programs unless they become citizens -- even though they are in the
            U,S. legally, are working and paying taxes and are responsible members
            of our communities. My Administration has always supported making
            individuals who encourage their relatives to emigrate to the United States
            responsible for the immigrant's well being. However, as a nation, we
            should not turn our backs on anyone who has lost their ability to earn a
            living due to injury, disease, or illness.

            Consequently, my budget proposes to make legal immigrants who
            become disabled after entering the United States eligible for SSI and
            Medicaid.

            My budget would also provide poor immigrant children the same Medicaid
            health care coverage low-income citizen children receive.

            The United States admits refugees and asylees into this country on a
            humanitarian basis. My budget proposes to lengthen the five-year
            exemption for refugees from the ban from five to seven years in order to
            give this group adequate time to naturalize.

            Finally, the law denies food stamps to most legal immigrants. My budget
            would delay the cutoffs from April 1, 1997 to August, 1997 in order to give
            immigrants more time to naturalize.

Question:   You 've said you Ire ready to work with Congress to fix the immigrant and food
            stamp parts of the welfare law, but some in the Republican leadership say the bill
            is fine as it is. Doesn't this mean your proposals will be dead on arrival?

Answer:     I think it is very significant that the nation's governors are now on record as
            recognizing that the cuts in benefits to legal immigrants are too harsh and need to
            be addressed -- even though their formal resolution was softened at the last minute
            at the request of the Congressional leadership.

            As the new welfare law is being implemented, the governors are gaining a new
            appreciation of some parts of the bill that I have had a problem with from the
            beginning -- those parts that are not related to putting people to work. This is
            particularly true of governors in states with large numbers of legal immigrants.
            They are now recognizing that many legal immigrants who are disabled, many in
            nursing homes, wiUlose their SSI and Medicaid over the summer. In addition to
            seeing that these provisions are unfair, they can see the potential costs to their own
            state budgets if they make the decision to ameliorate these cuts.

            I think that over time more and more people will come to see the harm that these
            provisions could do to hard-working people who came to this country and through
            no fault of their own, became disabled and could no longeer support their
            families.

            Also, I truly believe we are seeing some real changes in our relationship with the
            Congress. It appears that we have gotten past some of the unproductive ways of
            doing business we have had over the past two years, and that we are learning how
            to work with one another in a far more constructive fashion.



Question:   Last summer when you said you would sign the welfare bill there were
            press reports that you wanted to restore about $14 billion in cuts. Now we
            understand your budget includes $18 billion in legislative restorations.
            Are you proposing to restore more in food stamps and benefits to
            immigrants that you were last year?

Answer:     No, absolutely not. The budget includes $18 billion in legislative
            proposals for Food Stamps and immigrants thatcorrespond directly to the
            commitments I made at the time I signed the bill. Because of a number of

           Education Standards

           Question:   You proposed national tests in reading and math in your State of the Union
                       address. Yet the tests are not required, and you proposed no new funding to help
                       students pass these tests. Why do you think these tests will make a difference?

           Answer:     These tests reflect widely accepted national standards for 4th grade reading and
                       8th grade math. The standards are higher than those in many states, which means
                       they will lead to higher expectations for our students. The tests exist already, but
                       are only given to a small sample of students at anyone time. My plan is to make
                       those tests available for every state so they can be given to every 4th and 8th grade
                       student. Then students, parents and teachers will know how they measure up
                       against tough national standards.

                       My balanced budget plan provides significant increases for federal elementary and
                       secondary school programs that will help prepare students to meet these tougher
                       standards, including significant increases for Goals 2000, Title 1, teacher training,
                       charter schools, and my Technology Literacy Challenge fund. I've also proposed
                       an America Reads Challenge, to mobilize an army of I million volunteer tutors, to
                       help students read by the third grade. All of these programs help improve
                       teaching and learning in the classroom.

                       The point of these tests is to lift our students up, by setting a high standard for
                       them, and then preparing them to meet the standards. Federal funds are important
                       here. So are funds provided by states and local governments, which make up 94%
                       of spending for schools. But these national tests will require a national response,
                       from every school, every teacher, every parent and every student.

                       Finally, I am pleased at the response this testing proposal has already received.
                       Two weeks ago I spoke in Maryland, and the President of the State Board of
                       Education announced that Maryland would participate in these tests. Just this
                       morning, the Washington Post carried an endorsement of this plan from two
                       former Republican assistant secretaries of education [Diane Ravitch and Checker
                       Finn]. So we are beginning to move forward on this plan, and these tests will
                       make a real difference.
