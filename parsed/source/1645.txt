Folks--this issue has been kicking around and getting more momentum. VA
has analyzed over the last few years the claims of these Filipinos for
benefits as veterans having fought for the US in WWII.   I believe the
conclusion is that it would be extremely costly but I don't believe the
White House has ever engaged in a substantive analysis of the mer,its of
the claim other than the financial cost.   I think we need a process to
have thi.s resolved--it has gotten on the President's radar screen.  I
would be happy to coordinate this process, if you'll assign the
appropriate staff members for this work.   Thank you.
