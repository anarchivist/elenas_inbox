TEXT:
could you do items on: the AZT editorial and our response (the last time
we sent something to POTUS on this issue, he asked why a placebo group is
necessary at all; we never ansered, so I think now we should include
something about this in the item); needle exchange; fda reform; children's
coverage implementation; and whatever else you think appropriate.  The
sooner the better as always.
