           Subject:         Scheduling request for disability executive order signing

           Bill White of public liaison says that the scheduling request for the
           President to sign the executive order on people with disabilities has been
           tentatively OK'd for March 13, which is great. However, he was told it
           was to be a very short Oval Office signing with no remarks, no more than
           10 people, and no press.  We are a bit concerned that this will prompt
           complaints from the disability community that we aren't serious about it.
           Being able to do it in the Roosevelt with a few press present for 5
minutes of remarks by him would convey a much better message.       Bill will
push on this, but it would be good if we could too.
