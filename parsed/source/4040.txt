      President Clinton's Petition To The Federal Election Commission To
                                Ban "Soft Money"
                                           June 5, 1997


        Today, the President petitioned the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to revisit its rules
on "soft money" and act to ban the use of "soft money" in federal elections, as proposed in
bipartisan campaign finance refonn legislation now before Congress. The petition proposes to
end the current "soft money" system by requiring that candidates for federal office and national
parties be pennitted to raise and spend only "hard money" -- funds subject to the restrictions,
contribution limits, and reporting requirements of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA). This ban would apply to all political party committees, as anticipated by the bipartisan
campaign finance refonn legislation.        .


"Soft money" and federal elections

        "Soft money" plays an increasingly large role in funding political parties and campaigns.
So-called "hard money" contributions are those that are given to candidates or parties subject to
the limits and disclosure of federal law. "Soft money,"on the other hand, goes to national or state
political parties; and can be raised in large amounts and from sources (such as corporations and
unions).

       The role of "soft money" has grown dramatically in the past several elections. In 1996,
the Democratic Party raised $123 million, and the Republican Party raised $138 million in "soft.
money" -- more than triple the total of four years before.

        "Soft money" is today lawful under a series of Federal Election Commission (FEC)
regulations. The FEC first issued advisory opinions on this in 1978. It did not take further action
during the 1980's, as the role of "soft money"grew. In 1990, ordered to take some action on "soft
money" by a federal court, the FEC promulgated regulations that govern how parties can allocate
funds between federal and non-federal activities. (The court deferred to the agency as to may to
address the issue, but noted that the agency could go as far as to ban the use of soft money for
mixed federal- and state-political activity.)

       In addition, the 1979 statutory amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA) authorized allocation of national and state "hard money" for joint activities.

President Clinton's support for a "soft money" ban

      President Clinton has consistently called for legislation that would ban the use of "soft
money" in federal elections. He called for this legislation during the 1992 campaign, and

                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion
would have banned "soft money." The campaign finance reform plan he proposed in May 1993
included a "soft money" ban; this proposal was passed by both chambers but was killed by a
Senate filibuster in 1994.

        The bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation introduced by Senators McCain and
Feingold and Representatives Shays and Meehan would prohibit the use of "soft money" in
federal elections.

       In January, 1993, the Democratic National Committee voluntarily announced that it
would restrict contributions it can currently accept under the law. It would not accept "soft
money" contributions in excess of$IOO,OOO per year, and it would not accept contributions from
individuals who are not citizens or from domestic subsidiaries of foreign corporations.

Contents of the request to the FEe

        The President continues to call on Congress to enact the bipartisan legislation to reform
campaign financing and ban "soft money." In the meantime, he is formally requesting the FEC
to act now, under existing law, to write new regulations banning the use of "soft money" to
influence federal elections, as envisioned in the legislation. Specifically, the President is
requesting that the Commission consider new rulemaking to accomplish the following:

·      Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or agents)
       from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of
       FECA. (This action would preclude, for example, contributions directly from corporate
       or union treasuries, or contributions from individuals in excess of the amount an
       individual can give to a national party's federal account.)

·      Prohibit any federal officeholder or candidate (and his or her agents) from soliciting or
       receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FECA. (This action
       would preclude the same kind of contributions.)

·      Provide that any expenditure by any national, state, or local political party during a federal
       election year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter
       registration or get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising, or any communication that
       refers to a federal candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA. (This would
       end the allocation system, currently authorized by the FEe, under which "hard" and
       "soft" money are mixed for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)

Members of The Federal Election Commission
c/o Office of the General Council
999 E Street , NW
Washington, DC 20463


To the Members of the Federal Election Commission:

         I am writing to you, pursuant to 11 CFR Part 200, to request that you take action, under
your existing statutory authority, to ban "soft money" and end the system under which both
political parties compete to raise unlimited sums from individuals, labor unions, and corporations.

       The rules governing our system of financing federal election campaigns are sorely out of
date. Enacted more than two decades ago when election campaigns were much less expensive,
they have been overtaken by events, by dramatic changes in the nature and cost of campaigns
and the flood of money that has followed them. Today, money is raised and spent in ways that
simply were not contemplated when Congress last overhauled our campaign finance laws. We
must bring the rules up to date to reflect the changes in elections and campaigning that have
overtaken our political system.

         An important step in this process would be to change the rules governing the use and
solicitation of funds not subject to the contribution limitations and prohibitions of the 1971
Federal Election Campaign Act,. as amended ("soft money"). Currently FEC regulations (11
CFR 106.5) allow political parties to raise and spend "soft money" in elections involving state
and federal candidates by providing an allocation formula between federal and non-federal
expenses incurred by party committees. These regulations, and limited additional guidance
provided through advisory opinions, are the basis upon which party committees make
expenditures and raise funds with respect to federal and state elections today. The use of so-
called "soft money" by party committees today is largely based on the direction provided in these
regulations.

        Whatever the merit of those regulations at the time they were adopted, it has become
abundantly clear today that they are no longer adequate to the task of regulating current
campaigns. The role of "soft money" has grown dramatically in the past several elections so that
by the 1996 elections the two parties raised more than $250 million; $138 million by the


                                                                                     Management System
                                                                Aut011lllted Records
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
years before.

         The current allocation system, in short, is simply outmoded. Accordingly, I propose that
the FEC adopt new rules requiring that candidates for federal office and national parties be
permitted to raise and spend only "hard money" -- funds subject to the restrictions, contribution
limits, and reporting requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971, as
amended.

       The "soft money"ban I seek achieves similar goals as provisions of the "Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act of 1997", introduced by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold, and
Representatives Christopher Shays and Martin Meehan. Specifically, I am requesting that the
Commission consider new rulemaking to accomplish the following:

1.     Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or agents)
       from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of
       FECA. (This action would preclude, for example, contributions directly from corporate
       or union treasuries, or contributions from individuals in excess of the amount an
       individual can give to a national party's federal account.)

2.     Prohibit any federal officeholder or candidate (and his or her agents) from soliciting or
       receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FECA. (This action
       would preclude the same kind of contributions.)

3.     Provide that any expenditure by any national, state, or local political party during a federal
       election year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter
       registration or get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising, or any communication that
       refers to a federal candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA. (This would
       end the allocation system, currently authorized by the FEC, under which "hard" and
       "soft" money are mixed for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)

        These steps, available to you under your existing statutory authority, will enable our
election laws to catch up with the reality of the way elections are financed today, and along with
new camapign finance reform legislation, will take significant strides toward restoring public
confidence in the campaign finance process.

                                              Sincerely,




                                              William Jefferson Clinton



                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
