     Question: If a church or other religious organization hires a new welfare recipient, can the
     religious organization receive whatever subsidy is given to any other private employer?

     Answer: There are obviously tricky constitutional questions whenever a program involves
     governmental expenditures to religious organizations. But the goal of this Administration is to
     involve as many employers as possible in the effort to move people from welfare to work. And
     that means including as many employers as possible -- including religious organizations -- in any
     program to encourage employers to hire welfare recipients.



     Background: The law in this area is uncertain. Much may depend on (1) whether the religious
     organization is "pervasively sectarian" under Supreme Court law (i.e., a church, rather than an
     organization affiliated with a church) and/or (2) whether the employee is being hired for religious
     purposes. We should be supportive of including religious organizations generally in employer
     subsidy programs, without committing ourselves to defending each and every payment that could
     made to each and every religious organization under such a program.
