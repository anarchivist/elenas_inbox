TEXT:
After you left, George asked that a draft of the decision memo be circulated;
after the meeting, he said that meant to Rasco, Rovlin, Griffin, and him.   It
seems to me that the way to go is to recommend that the President reject the
bill because (1) it does not inlcude an exception for the health of the mother,
and (2) (not stressed as much) because it may apply to abortions that are done
prior to the last trimester and prior to viability.  It sounds as if what George
wants is for the President to take an up-front position that if narrowed in
these two ways, he would support it. (We should make clear because George didn't
seem to understand it, that such a bill would prevent abortions in cases of
fetal deformity.)  As we've discussed, I think it would be hard to argue that
such a position is unconstitutional (i.e., I think OLC's third argument is
weak). The question that the participants in the meeting didn't realy focus on
is: what happens if the health exception is included, but the bill continues to
apply to pre-viability as well as post-viability abortions? As a legal matter,
the question here has to do with whether this an undue burden. A certain answer
to this question would require lots of facts we don't know, having to do with
the circumstances in which this procedure could (or could not) be replaced by
other procedures; my hunch, though, is that the undue burden argument would be
a stretch.
