TEXT:
1. Just to clarify: the two provisions relating to new residents are at
402(a) (1) (B) (i) and 404(c).  The former, if taken alone, would suggest that
Wisconisn does not need a waiver to implement its proposed 60-day waiting
period; the latter, if taken alone, would suggest that Wisconsin does need a
waiver to take this action.     It is unclear what the answer should be given that
both these provisions -- 402 seeming to countenance any differential treatment
of new residents, 404 seeming to countenance only one kind (and not Wisconsin's
kind) of differential treatment -- are in the statute. HHS of course takes the
position that 404 is the controlling provision -- hence that Wisconsin needs a
waiver.    I am proceeding on the assumption that you don't want to contest this
interpretation.
2. Anna Durand and I spoke late Friday afternoon.      She told me that Mary Jo
didn't want to agree to the language she (Anna) had proposed on the residency
requirement.     I told her that Jack has always had strong feelings on this issue,
and there is no reason to think he will change them: he wants HHS to approve the
waiver on this issue in exactly the way we proposed months ago.     I also noted
that we should just do the thing rather than write a letter saying we would be
doing it sometime.     She didn't disagree, but she's clearly not calling the shots
here: she was going to go back to Mary Jo and call me on Monday.
