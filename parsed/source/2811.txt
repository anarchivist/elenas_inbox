The roundtable went very well, and the women's groups with whom I spoke
seemed very happy.   In fact, a few said it was the best roundtable they
had seen. The nurse stayed completely on message and emphasized that she
wanted nurses to be paid more because her daughter is going into nursing.
There was no mention of comparable worth at alL    The President seemed to
particularly like the older woman and how it tied into saving social
Security.   Another potential disaster averted.
