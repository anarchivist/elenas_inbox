TEXT:
1.  I'm not convinced. Why don't you talk with Tim Westmoreland? He's at
the Georgetown legislation program -- Devorah Adler will be able to give
you a number.

2.   I'd like to see it by the end of the day.  And I do not think that a
stripped-down brief can include any explicit conclusions on the merits of
the state action issue.   If the SG can't write a brief without those
conclusions, then we're really left with a choice between filing or not
filing.   And by the way, my understanding is that Shalala and Min now want
a true stripped-down brief -- at least, that's what Thurm told Podesta
this morning.
