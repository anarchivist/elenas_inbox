TEXT:

PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
Thank you very much for writing to me about proposition 211, the
California ballot initiative regarding securities lawsuits.
I opposed this Proposition, and I applaud the voters of
California for rejecting it, because it would have increased the
number of frivolous lawsuits and undermined the ability of
investors to receive full and accurate corporate information.   I
believe strongly in the need to protect the rights of defrauded
investors, as my veto of last year's Securities Reform Act
attests. But Proposition 211's creation of a novel cause of
action, broader than any now recognized, would have gone much too
far in the other direction, deterring companies from providing
useful information and thereby harming American investors.
Thank you again for giving me your views.
