TEXT:
I'm sending you back a new version of your AIDS memo.  I tried to combine
the two memos you gave me, and also to condense it all into a few pages.
I put your name on it in addition to Bruce's, because I think the
President would want to know what YOU think.  But that makes it all the
more important that you make sure that in condensing and e~iting, I
haven't distorted your meaning.  Let me know if you want me to make any
changes.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:          Bmce Reed, Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy
               Eric Goosby, Interim Director, ONAP

RE:            Update on Status of Needle Exchange Programs

There have been a number of recent events involving needle exchange programs. On Febmary
13, a National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference Statement recommended lifting the ban
on use of federal funds for needle exchange programs. On February 18, HHS sent a
Congressionally requested report to the Senate Appropriations Committee reviewing the scientific
data on needle exchange programs to date. This memo provides background to put the issue in
context and discusses these recent events.

Current Statute. There are three statutory restrictions on the use of federal funds for needle
exchange programs. (1) The Substance Abuse and Mental Health (SAMHSA) block grant
prohibits use of federal funds for needle exchange unless the Surgeon General determines that
needle exchange is effective in reducing the spread of HIV and the use of illegal drugs. The
statute does permit federal research and evaluation of existing needle exchange programs. (2)
The 1996 Ryan White CARE Act reauthorization places a flat prohibition on the use of Ryan
White funds for needle exchange. (3) The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill prohibits funding of
needle exchange unless the Secretary determines that such programs are effective in preventing
the spread of HIV and do not encourage the use of illegal drugs.

Epidemiology of HIV Infection. Thirty six percent of AIDS cases are directly or indirectly caused
by IV dmg use. Up to fifty percent of new HIV infections may be related to IV drug use. The
effects of IV drug use have become a driving force in the HIV epidemic.

Number ofNeedle Exchange Programs. There are over 100 needle exchange programs in the US,
with most programs operating in two or more sites. As of 1995, twenty one States had local
needle exchange programs.

Federally Sponsored Research. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at NIH has
funded 15 demonstration projects to evaluate the impact of needle exchange programs on rates of
HIV infection and patterns of dmg use (including the effectiveness of these programs as gateways

                                             Automated Records Management System

also been a significant amount of privately funded research on needle exchange programs
through foundations and other nonprofit groups.

State and LocaJ Government. At its most recent meeting, the National Governors Association
passed a resolution stating: "Federal restrictions or requirements on the use of available funding
interfere with the ability of States to develop comprehensive prevention strategies." The
Association of State and Territorial Health Officers (ASTHO) passed the following resolution in
December 1995: "The federal government should repeal the ban on the use of federal funds for
needle exchange services to allow interested States and localities the financial flexibility to support
successful prevention and treatment initiatives within their jurisdictions." The US Conference of
Mayors also supports lifting the ban on use of federal funds for needle exchange.

HHS Report to Senate Appropriations. Report language was included in the September 1996
Senate L/HHS Appropriations bill requesting that HHS provide a report on the status of current
research projects, an itemization of previously funded research, and findings-to-date regarding the
efficacy of needle exchange programs for reducing HIV transmission and not
encouraging illegal drug use. The report prepared by HHS reviewed all published studies of US
needle exchange programs, including one by the Institute of Medicine; it did not attempt to
determine if the Congressional standard has been met for lifting the ban on federal funding. The
summary section of the report contains the following: "Overall these studies' indicate that needle
exchange programs can have an impact on bringing difficult to reach populations into systems of
care that offer drug dependency services, mental health, medical and support services. These
studies also indicate that needle exchange programs can be an effective component ofa
comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV and other blood borne infectious diseases in communities
that choose to include them."

NIH Consensus Conference. A NIH Consensus Development Conference on Interventions to
Prevent HIV Risk' Behaviors was held February 11-13, 1997. This conference was developed and
directed by a non-Federal panel of experts, predating the Congressional request for an HHS
report. The resulting Consensus Conference Statement is an independent report of an expert
panel, not a policy statement of the NIH. This Statement, released on February 13, concluded
that needle exchange programs are effective in reducing both HIV transmission and IV drug use
and recommended lifting the legislative restrictions on needle exchange prog~ams.

AnaJysis of Evidence on Needle Exchange Programs and IV Drug Use. The preponderance of data
collected so far suggests a stable or declining level of drug use among needle exchange
participants. About half of the studies on the effects of needle exchange show a decline in drug
use. Two studies show an increase in drug use, but these studies have been discounted by expert
panels as outliers. In addition, almost all studies indicate that needle exchange program
participants tend to be older (median age 33 to 41 years old) and tend to be long-term users
(duration of use 7 to 20 years). There is no data to suggest needle exchange programs increase

                                                                                                          3

     new initiates into drug use, and the age of participants often increases over time.

     It is important to note, however, that most studies have methodological weaknesses, inherent to
     the population and subject, that are nearly impossible to overcome. These methodological
     problems include: 1) reliance upon individuals' self-reporting of drug use; 2) the difficulties of
     creating a control group that does not receive clean needles yet continues participating in the
     study; and 3) the difficulties of isolating the effects of needle exchange programs from the many
     other factors that may influence drug use in a given population.

     The Administration's Response. HHS, ONDCP, and the White House jointly developed a
     response to questions about the HHS report and NIH Conference Statement. This response
     states that data on the effect of needle exchange 'programs in reducing HIV seroprevalence is
     solid, but that data on the effect of these programs on drug use patterns is less clear. The
     response further states that HHS will continue research efforts to evaluate new data on needle
     exchange programs and will work with the Congress on effective HIV prevention strategies.
     General McCaffrey strongly believes that the Administration should not challenge or raise
     questions about the current legislative restrictions on needle exchange programs.

     Next Steps for HHS in Evaluating Effects on Drug Use. HHS will conduct a scientific review of
     the data presented at the NIH Consensus Conference. That data have not yet been through the
     peer review process required for publication, and need close examination. A second step will be
     an analysis of data already collected through the NIDA demonstration projects, which have not
     yet been specifically studied for effect on drug utilization patterns.

     Congressional Climate and Community Expectations. The HHS report was released during the
     Congressional recess, and Hilj reaction has been muted to date. This week Harold Varmus,
     Director of the NIH, received direct questions on needle exchange from Reps. Dickey (R-AR)
     and Wicker (R-MS) during a NIH Appropriations hearing. Secretary Shalala also received one
     question on lifting the federal funding ban prior to release of the report.

      Both the House and Senate generally have punted the issue of needle exchange programs to
      HHS. The exception is last year's prohibition on use of Ryan White treatment funds for needle
      exchange programs, which passed unanimously. The Congressional response to any attempt to
     left restrictions on funding likely would be hostile. The climate, however, may be softening
     somewhat. Senator Specter, Chair of the L/HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, has come to
     support needle exchange programs (Philadelphia has one of the largest); Rep. Rangel, once
      adamantly opposed to needle exchange, is reported to be shifting in his stance; and the state
     flexibility arguments advanced by NGA and ASTHO may also start to have an effect.

     The AIDS community is united in seeking an end to the ban on federal funding of needle
     exchange programs. With some exceptions, however, the national AIDS organizations

                                                   Hex-Dump Conversion

understand the downside of demanding that the ban be lifted before the necessary educational
and political groundwork is laid. What the community wants from the Administration at this
point is not so much an immediate lifting of the restrictions as a strong indication that the
Administration generally will let science guide policy in combating HIV transmission.
