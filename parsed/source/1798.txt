                                             December 8, 1997

     MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

     FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                              GENE SPERLING
                              CHRIS JENNINGS

     SUBJECT:                 New AIDS Initiative

            We have developed a $115 million initiative for your FY 1999 budget to improve AIDS
     treatment and prevention programs. This increase would go to expand programs that are critical
     to preventing and treating this epidemic, including the AIDS Assistance Drugs Program (ADAP),
     which extends life-saving new treatment therapies to low-income and underserved populations .

    . Background on AIDS Funding

             Since you came into office, AIDS programs that focus on treatment and prevention have
     improved dramatically. Medicaid, which provides coverage for half of all people with AIDS,
     now covers protease inhibitors. Funding for the Ryan White Program has increased by 200
     percent since FYl993, funding for research at NIH has increased by 50 percent since that year, and
     funding for the ADAP program has increased 450 percent since 1996.

              The AIDS community, however, has expressed disappointment with the Administration's
     recent efforts in this area. AIDS groups criticized the Administration for failing to propose major
     increases in discretionary spending in FY1998, which allowed Congress to outspend us in this
     area. And injust the last few weeks, the AIDS community reacted negatively to HCFA's
     conclusion that budget neutrality requirements prohibit establishing a Medicaid demoristration to
     provide early treatment to relatively healthy HIV -infected individuals. There .is no doubt that the
     AIDS community will be examining the Administration's FY 1999 budget submission very
     closely.

     Proposal

            The AIDS office is recommending, and we agree, that you propose an $115 million
     increase in your FY 1999 budget for AIDS treatment and prevention. (OMB is currently
     recommending $100 million). All of this spending would go to existing discretionary programs
     that emphasize prevention and treatment. We would recommend that the majority of this
     increase go to the ADAP program, because new and effective treatments of this disease are
     currently not reaching many who need them. We also would recommend modest increases to
     CDC prevention education programs, as well as a range of programs providing funds to states,


                                                                  Automated Records Management System
                                                                  Hex-Dump Conversion

       Although the $115 million that we are suggesting falls far short of the $400 million the
AIDS advocates are pushing, it is a significant investment that will improve AIDS treatment and
prevention and soften criticism from the community.

        Finally, in the wake of HCFA's decision on the Medicaid demonstration program
discussed above, Nancy-Ann Min DeParle is looking into the possibility of a legislative proposal
(which of course need not be budget neutral) for a model pilot project to expand eligibility to
Medicaid for people with HIV earlier in the progression of their disease. As ofthis writing, we
have significant questions about whether such a proposal is feasible and whether it could be done
in time for the budget process. At the request of the Vice President, however, we are reviewing
all options in this area closely.

                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion
