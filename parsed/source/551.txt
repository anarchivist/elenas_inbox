TEXT:
Both the statement and the one-pager look great to me, though on the
statement (1) I would put back some reference to government-funded
research (2) fix the couple of typos in the fourth paragrah, and (3)
perhaps change the first sentence of the last paragraph slightly (do ALL
parents desperately want to do right by their children? how about the
abusers, etc. amongst them?)
Do we also have q&a?
