        Subject:         Daily Report: Food for Thought

        Nicaragua boasts a· unique cuisine.   Typical meals consist of eggs or meat,
        beans and rice, salad (cabbage and tomatoes), tortillas and fruit in.
        season. Most common of all Nicaraguan foods is gallo pinto, a blend of
        rice and beans, with cooking water from the beans added to color the rice.
        Other traditional dishes include bajo, a mix of beef, green and ripe
        plantains and yucca (cassava), and vigor¢n, yucca served with fried pork
        skins and colesla0 . . Street vendors sell interesting drinks such as tiste,
        made from cacao and corn, and posol con leche, a corn and milk drink.    And
        most important, Nicaragua boasts the best beer and rum in Central America.

        There's a decent chance the President might be enjoying one of these
        regional delicacies when he reads our Daily Report tonight.   Please send
        me your updates by 4 pm this afternoon '(3/8) so we can get the report out
        in time for supper.
