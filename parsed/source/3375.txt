 I've sent the attached to Bruce. Let me know if you have any suggestions.
 USDA is fully on board. According to Greg Frazier, it is entirely up to us
 whether we wish to do a directive; USDA also can go ahead without one.   I think
 a directive would make sense, but we probably should run this by the appropriate
 people.
 DOJ is thinking. As always.    Though in this case, I think they will think their
 way to approval.   I told Chris we needed an answer by the end of the day.

 TEXT:
 In light of the meeting this morning, I took it on myself to fiddle with the
 signing statment so as to include something about the food stamp/legal immigrant
 problem.  I would suggest the following:
 In the second pargapraph on p. 3, after the phrase "no fault of their own," add:
  "Neither should they be deprived of food stamp assistance when they have
 applied for citi·zenship and are only awaiting governmental approval of their
 applications."
 Then, at the end of that paragraph, add: "In addition, I will take all possible
 executive action to ensure that applicants for citizenship do not lose benefits
 pending action on their naturalization applications."
 What do you think?
