Subject:         Sentencing Guidelines

Folks - -.Minyon and I were discussing how we tell interested parties
(especially certain members of the Congressional Black Caucus) about the
sentencing commission's recommendations and realized that we don't know
very much about the commission, its makeup and its processes. Would one
of you please give us a short fact sheet on the commission? Our plan
would be for phone calls to be made this afternoon to give folks a heads
up--we need talking points and agreement to go ahead.     Thanks.
