TEXT:
I misunderstood.   I thought you were talking about HHS talking with Wisconsin
on Monday about its waiver request.   That's what I was asking about.
 (By the way, I think I'll cavil at your phrasing of the other waiver message.
We just can't say that states shouldn't try to evade legal requirements.   There
is no legal requirement of this kind.   What we can say is that states shouldn't
do this -- and if they do, both we and Congress will respond.)
