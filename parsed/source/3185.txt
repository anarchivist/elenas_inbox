TEXT:
I just talked with peter.  He said Mark Gaede had told him we should file.  Then
Jim Lyons said we shouldn't. Now, Peter said, Jim is going to have another
conversation with Katie and call him back.  Peter asked me whether if Jim
approved filing, that would be enough.  I said I didn't think Jim would approve,
based on our conversation this morning, but that if he did, we should have
another conversation.  I'm not sure I understand what's going on here.  But the
more I think about it, the more I think it is crucial to have some time on this
one.
