     MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY

     Subject:       Importation ofUzi and Galil FiremTI1s

     The historic Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned 19 specific assault
     weapons, duplicates of those 19 firearms and certain other semiautomatic weapons possessing
     various military style features. The Administration and Congress worked to ban these deadly
     firearms because -- as the weapon of choice for gangs and drug dealers -- they were being
     recovered at numerous crime scenes ·and resulting in criminals being better armed than some of
     the nation's law enforcement officers. Last year, in part as a result of the ban on assault
     weapons, fewer police officers were slain in the line of duty than in any year since 1960, and
     fewer law enforcement officer was killed by assault weapons.

     In addition to the prohibitions contained in the 1994 ban on assault weapons, the 1968 Gun
     Control Act further restricts the importation of firearms ).lnless they are determined to be
     particularly suitable for or readily adaptable for sporting purposes. To enforce this law, the
     Treasury Department has developed a factoring system to determine whether handguns meet this
     sporting purposes test and are thus importable. The Department also determined that
     semiautomatic assault type rifles do not meet the sporting purposes test and are not importable.

     I am now informed that 2 of the 19 assault weapons that were specifically banned from
     importation in 1989, the Galil and the Uzi, have been redesigned in order to circumvent the ban.
     The Galil and Uzi, which are manufactured by Israeli Military Industries, were banned because --
     in their military configurations -- they were found to have no legitimate sporting purpose. It is
     now appropriate to determine whether the redesigned weapons would have legitimate sporting
     purposes in this country and are suitable for continued importation under the provisions of the
     Gun Control Act of 1968.

     My Administration has aggressively enforced all applicable laws to keep non-sporting firearms
     and other munitions posing a threat to public safety from entering the country. Therefore, I
     direct you to:

            1)      Take the necessary steps to reexamine and determine whether the sporting
                    purposes test should be modified with respect to the importation of the Galil, Uzi
                    and any other firearms that have been similarly adapted or re-engineered since the
                    1989 ban on the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles or the 1994 ban on
                    semiautomatic assault weapons;

            2)      Effective immediately, suspend action on pending and future applications to
                    import these weapons until this review is complete.

     Nothing herein shall be construed to require actions contrary to applicable provisions of law.



                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
