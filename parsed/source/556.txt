Subject:          LRM MDH 32 -- Justice Proposed Draft Bill to Amend the Child
Support Recovery Act

You should have just received a copy of a Department of Justice draft bill
that would amend the Child Support Recovery Act pursuant to the
President's July 21, 1996, directive to establish a felony offense for a
person who willfully fails to pay child support for a child in another'
state. Note that this draft bill is similar'to one that Justice
transmitted to the Congress on September 27, 1996.

Justice has requested that OMB provide it with clearance to transmit its
draft bill by tomorrow (Thursday, March 13th) .  For this reason, please
provide me with comments no later than 10 a.m. tomorrow.  Thank you.
