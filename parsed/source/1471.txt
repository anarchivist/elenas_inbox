Subject:         reo public health groups meeting with VP

Joan Claybrook, the President of Public Citizen (my former employer, as
you know), called me to ask for her or David Vladeck, the Director of
Public Citizen's Litigation Group, to be included in the meeting with the
VP tomorrow of health groups.   (I wasn't aware of such a meeting, but she
said it was in the paper.)   They were involved in the FDA litigation
 (they were intervenors on behalf of the public health groups in the North
Carolina case), and have been involved in a number of other ways.

Unless this is a smaller meeting (i.e., of people who only love the deal,
etc.), it would make sense to include Claybrook or Vladeck. THANKS.
