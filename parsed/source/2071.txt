TEXT:
Karen Popp tells me that the AG is scheduled to make a final decision on
this issue on Friday.  (Popp also says that she got asked by a reporter
from the Oregonian a couple of days whether the White House was preventing
DOJ from ruling.)  Popp says that the AG really wants to know what we
think as a matter of policy before she makes any decision -- legal,
policy, or otherwise.  But the AG is also feeling real pressure to get a
letter up to Congress.  So -- what do we tell her???
