TEXT:
As I told Jack on Friday, DOJ definitely wants to seek cert in this case.
The 8G's Office says that it always seeks cert when lower courts have held
a statute unconstitutional; in essence, the Office uses the same standard
in determining whether to seek cert as it does in deciding whether to
defend the statute initially. The NEA is obviously unhappy with
proceeding any further; it is worried that the decision to seek cert will
deeply offend the arts community, which then will refuse to support the
agency in future congressional battles over funding.  But given the SG's
general policy, combined with the broader politics of this issue, I don't
see any way to support the NEA in its effort to stop DOJ from going
further.  I anyone disagrees, let me know.

There are obviously going to be real battles (both within DOJ and between
DOJ and the NEA) over what arguments to make in this brief and how to make
them.  We should stay close to this case, so we can weigh in on those
questions.
