TEXT:
we feel pretty strongly about some of these suggested changes.  i'd be
grateful if you kept an eye out for whether they're accepted.

Subject:         Edits to Cover Letter for Drug Strategy

David:

Per your voice mail to me, I'd recommend the following changes to ONDCP's
letter:

1. paragraph 5 (2nd bullet on addicts), 2nd sentence: Drop everything
after "treatment gap." We don't need to mention methadone in the
President's letter, and Chris Jennings has to make a judgment on whether
or not parity is mentioned in the strategy at all.

2. paragraph 6 (3rd bullet on crime and drugs):      Replace entire paragraph
with the following:

Numerous studies confirm that the vast majority of prisoners report drug
use and that many prisoners commit their crimes to buy drugs or while
high.  To help break this iron link between crime and drugs, we must
promote Zero Tolerance Drug Supervision that works to keep offenders drug-
and crime-free. We can do this by helping states and localities implement
tough new systems to drug test, treat, and punish prisoners, parolees, and
probationers.

3. paragraph 9, 3rd sentence: I'd add Bob Rubin to the list of cabinet
members mentioned.  Treasury gets miffed when they don't get included in
our crime/drug rhetoric.

Jose'
