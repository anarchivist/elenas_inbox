TEXT:
FYI: This executive order needs a fair bit of work. The biggest problem is that
there isn't right now a legally sufficient basis for the order stated in the
introductory section. That section talks a lot about how the order promotes
health and safety and improves the environment, all of which is very nice but
legally irrelevant (or at least incomplete). There's very little discussion of
what there should be discussion of: how the order relates (whether through
health and safety effects or otherwise) to the procurement process and the
efficiency of governmental contracting.  In addition, the enforcement mechanisms
in the order raise some questions.  But not to worry: we're on the case.
