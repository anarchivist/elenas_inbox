SUBJECT:   Re: Rvw of Connerly Letter

TO: Andrew J. Mayock ( CN=Andrew J. Mayock/OU=WHO/O=EOP @ EOP [ WHO 1 )
READ:UNKNOWN

TEXT:
Way too long, I think -- it tries too hard to convince and sounds
defensive. After the basic thank you/share your letter stuff, there
should be one paragraph on the President's views on affirmative action
(both the mend and the don't end parts), and a short paragraph on
California/Texas. Then sign off.
