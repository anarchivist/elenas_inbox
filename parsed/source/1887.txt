TEXT:
arshad mohammed of reuters just told me that at least person in the White
House has told him that the numbers in the WSJ article are "shockingly
accurate."  He really, really wanted confirmation of the 15 billion total
pricetag. Of course, I told him I couldn't help -- which in fact I
couldn't; does it all add up to that?
