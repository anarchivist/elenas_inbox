         The Republicans in Congress have made clear that they will try to attach a "Beck
provision" to some piece oflegislation that you want to sign. This provision (named after a
Supreme Court case) would prevent a union from using compulsory dues for political purposes
unless a union member specifically authorizes such use. It goes much further than current law,
which allows a union to use dues for political activity except when a union member specifically
objects and demands reimbursement. Unions correctly believe that the Republican Beck
provision (there may be a Democratic version that simply codifies current law) would gravely
interfere with their political activity. They would like the President to threaten a veto of such
legislation.

        Proposal: State strong opposition to Beck legislation, no matter what it is attached to, but
refrain from making a veto threat.

       Pro:    This approach will make clear your vehement opposition to this legislation and
               will fortify Congressional Democrats in trying to defeat it. It will not, however,
               back you into a comer in the event Republicans succeed in attaching the Beck
               provision to some essential bill.

       Con: The unions would prefer that you threaten a veto of any legislation containing a
            Beck provision.

       Recommendation: John Hilley, Bruce Reed, and I all recommend that you state strong
opposition to Beck legislation, no matter what it is attached to.




                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion



    6. Welfare reform and minimum wage

            The AFL will press the Vice President to take a position on whether worker protection
    statutes -- particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) -- apply to welfare recipients
    participating in work activities under the new welfare law. Bruce Reed and Ken Apfel ofOMB
    have been running an interagency process (involving DOL, HHS, USDA, and others) to hammer
    out an answer to this question. The trick is to figure out how to apply the minimum wage law to
    workfare participants without imposing large new costs on states. Bruce and Ken are confident
    that a solution can be worked out that goes a fair way toward satisfying the unions, yet does not
    upset many governors. But they are a few weeks away from presenting this proposed solution to
    you. And everyone seems to agree that if the Vice President announces an Administration
    position favorable to the unions at the Council meeting, both the governors and the Congress
    could react very negatively. There is a danger that such an announcement would make a
    complex and studied welfare implementation decision look like a mere gift to the unions.

             Proposal: The Vice President should not raise the minimum wage issue at the Council
    meeting. Members of the Vice President should give John Sweeney some private assurances
    that the Administration will soon put out its position and that the key questions -- most notably,
    whether workfare participants count as "employees" for purposes of the minimum wage law --
    will come out his way. When asked about the issue, the Vice President should make a strong
    statement of principle that workers shouldn't be paid a subminimum wage, whether or not they
    come off the welfare rolls. But he should also be careful to note that the Administration is still in
    the process of developing its final positions on the complex issues arising from the intersection
    of the labor laws and welfare law.

           Pro:    This approach will minimize the likelihood of a backlash from governors and/or
                   Congress, by giving the Administration time to refine its position so as to make it
                   more palatable to the states and by issuing the position in a non-political setting.

           Con: This approach will not fully satisfy members of the AFL Council, who would
                prefer a clear and public statement of the Administration's position at or prior to
                the Council meeting.

           Recommendation: I recommend that you adopt Bruce and Ken's proposal on how to
    handle this issue.

                                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion
