TEXT:
Kathy said sylvia spoke to her about the office question. Sylvia said she
was getting "bad vibes" about it and made the point that most deputies
don't have WH offices.   (Of course, the other two policy council deputies
do.)  From the cpnversation, Kathy thought you should talk with Sylvia
again before too much time goes by.
