Subject:         DOD 0-3. report

DoD hired a contractor to produce that thing!!  (It was their chance to
brief Sec. Cohen on the stuff as well.)   We have also identified a Rear
Admiral who can come in uniform and who is in charge of child care and
parenting programs for the Navy and is a true believer in this stuff.
