ONDCP has done all the inviting. approx. 150, police groups, drug
organizations, etc. Leg. Affairs thinks 15 members will show up -- I'll
get you that list when we have it.

STAGE: Backdrop is a 4' x 6' Copy of the cover of the Drug Strategy
Report.  It's an         American Flag with the words 1997 Drug Control
Strategy. It's nice looking.

        Right now on stage we will put 6, of the Cabinet members who are
                        showing up. Reno, Shala, Rubin, Slater, and
Shalikashvilli.  In                      addition to those speaking in
the program.

        Also, we have 10 kids, age 11-15, that we are trying to put in the
front row w             lout offending any VIP's.

PROGRAM:


    ,.
VP
McCaffrey
Kid tbd
POTUS

I'll fax you all remarks by end of the day today (except POTUS).        Carolyn
Curiel is doing POTUS remarks and Dennis is working with her.

I left a message for Marcia Hale to see if the President could announce ~
date for the Mayor's Drug Summit, but I haven't heard back .. Maybe you can
also ask her.

Briefing is in the Oval. McCaffrey wants to bring Janet Crist and the
Deputy Director of ONDCP. Would you want Reno there in case he has
questions about Drug Court Grants or will you be fine on your own. Just
let me know, b/cright now we're having all the Cabinet, except McCaffrey,
to come directly to Room 450.
