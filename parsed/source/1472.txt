                   DOMESTIC EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS
                          FOR GREENHOUSE GASES


1. Introduction
        Under emissions trading programs, emissions allowances are first allocated or auctioned.
These allowances may then be traded. Allowances can have substantial value, so distributional
issues are an important component of program design.
        Emission trading programs offer both "static" and "dynamic" efficiency advantages over
more traditional forms of regulation. Trading allows those with higher abatement costs to
purchase allowances from those whose costs are lower. Total costs will therefore be lower than
under traditional regulation, which require all polluters to comply with a specific standard.
Nevertheless, emissions trading may often involve people and firms adjusting to higher prices.
        Under traditional regulation, firms have little incentive to abate pollution by more than the
minimum required. As a result, firms under-invest in pollution control R&D. Emissions trading
offers dynamic efficiency gains by creating incentives to continuously improve pollution
abatement technologies in order to generate "surplus" allowances for sale.

2. US Experience with Emissions Trading

      The US has had more experience with emissions trading than any other country.
Examples include:

Sulfur Dioxide (502) Allowance Trading: The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required a
    50 reduction in S02 emissions from electric utility boilers. To accomplish this goal, a fixed
    number of emission allowances were allocated to electric utilities based on a formula
    reflecting historical emissions. In addition, a small portion of allowances are auctioned every
   year to facilitate price discovery and new entrants. Allowances are specifically excluded from
    being defined as rights to pollute, may be traded to any party anywhere, and may be
   "banked" for use in future years. Participants need to conduct regular monitoring of
   emissions and make an annual accounting of their emissions. Penalties are imposed if
   emissions exceed the number of allowances held by a source.

   A functioning market in S02 allowances now exists, involving both bilateral exchanges


                                                 1


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                                          DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE
    between companies, and brokered exchanges through third parties. This market, along with
    other factors,l has helped to dramatically reduce the cost of the abatement program. Initially,
    forecasters claimed that a 50 reduction (10 million tons) in S02 would correspond to
    allowance prices in the range of $400 to $1000.2 However, prices for allowances that would
    be needed in the next decade to achieve this level of emission reduction currently range
    between $100 to $120. In addition, 1995 emissions were actually 40 below the legally
    required levels for that year.

Water Emuent Trading: The US generally has regulated surface water quality through a system
    of discharge limits for large sources of water pollution. In addition, states have standards for
    ambient water quality which are often not attained even after large dischargers apply "best
    technology." The reason is that small ("nanpoint") sources (such as runoff from farms)
    contribute significantly to water pollution. A number of state and local governments are
    employing trading systems for watersheds that either permit trading among large dischargers,
    or allow large dischargers to fulfill their requirements by controlling nonpoint sources. These
    include the Fox River in Wisconsin, the Dillon Reservoir in Colorado, and the Tar-Pamlico
    River in North Carolina. The latter two programs are designed to manage future economic
    growth. Thus, the quantity of effluent allowances allocated exceeds current discharge levels.
    Once growth consumes this excess, trading is expected to reduce compliance costs.

Inter-refinery Lead Trading: EPA operated a lead trading program from 1983 to 1987 as it
    phased out lead from gasoline. Lead trading allowed refiners and importers to trade lead
    reduction credits in order to meet limits for the lead content of gasoline. The quantity of
    allowances to which a firm was entitled was determined by the amount of leaded fuel
    produced by the firm and the contemporaneous EPA standard. Those who bettered the
    standard could sell their credits to others. Some 10 billion grams of lead were traded during


1 These include the fact that the target that was actually adopted was not as onerous as many in industry had feared,
the low price and widespread availability of low sulfur coal, the awarding of "bonus allowances," the postponement
of capital investments, and lower than expected transportation costs.

                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

   the course of the program at prices ranging from 0.75 to 5 cents per gram. Allowing the
   trading of lead credits reduced the costs of the program by approximately 20 percent.

Criteria Air Pollutant Trading: EPA first began incorporating aspects of emissions trading in its
   air program in 1974, when it allowed a modified source to use "credits" earned by another
   source within the same plant to avoid additional regulatory requirements. Since then,
   emission trading has substantially expanded. Trades have numbered in the thousands and
   have been estimated by Hahn and Hester (1986) to have achieved savings between $525
   million and $12 billion.

Market Mechanisms [or ChloroUuorocarbon (CFC) PhaseOUt" Under the 1987 Montreal
    Protocol to limit stratospheric ozone depletion, the U.S. required the phase out of the
    production of CFCs by 1996. As part of its program, the U.S. adopted a tradeable permit
    regime covering CFC manufacturers and importers. These allowances were allocated based
    on each firm's 1986 market share. As the market for CFCs declined, the system allowed firms
    to allocate production among different facilities according to the least-cost pattern of supply.
    It also gave CFC users the flexibility to switch between different CFC compounds, within the
    overall limit on allowances. This program helped reduce the costs of the phaseout. In 1988,
   .EPA estimated that the cost to halve CFC use would be $3.55 per kilogram. By 1993, it
    became clear that all uses could be eliminatedby 1996 at a cost of $2.45 per kilogram.

3. Emissions Trading of Greenhouse Gases

         A greenhouse gas emissions trading program would likely contain several elements. First,
emissions budgets would be established. Some entity or entities would be given responsibility
for verifying compliance and the integrity of allowances. Noncompliance with allowance
limitations or reporting requirements would result in penalties. The program would establish
permit lifetimes, monitoring and enforcement provisions, and rules for permit banking,
borrowing, and trading.

       Among the important issues to be addressed in designing a domestic emissions trading
program are:

       --Where the constraint is imposed. A "primary fuel" trading program would limit the
       production or import of fossil fuels. A "sectoral" trading program would limit emissions
       from one or more key sectors (e.g. utilities, transport or heavy manufacturing).

       --How permits are distributed. Permits could be given to existing emitters, given to


                                                 3

                                                             Hex-Dwnp Conversion

others (who could then sell them back to existing emitters), auctioned, or some
combination of the foregoing. If permits are auctioned, substantial revenues could be
raised. (Options for using these revenues include tax cuts, deficit reduction and support
for transitional or technology programs). If permits are given away, recipients would
potentially receive a windfall.

These and related issues are discussed below.

       A. Where the constraint is imposed

        Carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion currently accounts for about 85 of U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions. A trading program could be implemented at various points in the
energy market, including fuel import, fuel extraction, processing, refining, distribution, and
secondary conversion (e.g., coal to electricity). These points could vary by sector. For example,
an emissions trading program could focus on the point of final combustion for coal, but on
refining for oil, or distribution for natural gas.

       Possible programs are described below:

       Primary Fuel Emissions Trading

         The primary fuel producing sector - extraction, processing, refining, and distribution -
has many levels where a permit program could be implemented. One option would be to
require permits at the point of first sale (a permit is surrendered with the first inter- or intra-
company transaction). Such a system would include transactions between a coal company and an
electric utility, between a natural gas producer and its marketing arm, between a natural gas
producer and a broker, or between an oil extraction company and its refinery operations. Fuel
importers would also require permits to import fuel. This would capture the carbon from fuel
consumed in the refining process. The number of market actors under this program design
would be under 5000 and virtually all carbon in the energy sector would be included in the
program.

       Sectoral Emission Trading

        An emissions trading program could also be applied at the point of combustion, allowing
trading among affected sources. This system would be most comparable to the current S02
emissions allowance trading system.




                                                5


                                                              Automated Records Management System
                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                                    DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE

        Including the six largest industrial CO 2 -emitting sectors (electric utilities, cement, primary
metals, pulp and paper, petroleum refining and chemicals) in a trading program could encompass
as many as 20,000 market participants and 90 percent of industrial CO 2 emissions. Mobile
source emissions could be indirectly included in the system by allocating transportation
equipment manufacturers permits for emissions associated with their automobile fleets or by
including refiners in the program. Residential and commercial emissions could be similarly
addressed by focusing upstream in the energy system. The electric generating sector could use
existing monitoring and reporting infrastructure.

    In determining where constraints would best be imposed, the following factors may be
relevant:

   Administrative and compliance feasibility: The number of sources involved in the trading
   program should be small enough to be administratively feasible and large enough to ensure
   market competition. In addition, monitoring and verification of permit compliance must be
   possible for those included in the program.

   Public Acceptance: The program must consider the ease or difficulty with which various
   allocation approaches would be accepted by the public.

   Potential to Diffuse Low Greenhouse Gas Technologies: Alternative points of intervention
   should be evaluated for their ability to provide incentives for research, development, adoption
   and diffusion of low greenhouse gas technologies.

   Market Impacts: The permit program will have economic impacts on firms that vary
   depending on program design. For example, exempting certain sizes or categories of sources
   from permit requirements because of administrative or equity concerns (e.g., small boilers or
   home heating oil) has competitive implications within the energy market.

   Consistency with the international trading system: The domestic program should be
   consistent with any international prescriptions concerning the coverage of sources and gases.


       2. Who gets permits
        In an emissions trading system, permits can be given to existing emitters on the basis of
baseline/historical emissions or other formulae, given to others (who can then sell them to
emitters), auctioned (where revenues accrue to the government), or some combination of the
foregoing.
       Permit allocation formulae could take into account the market impacts of the mitigation

                                                   6

                                                              Hex-Dump Conversion
                                    DO NOT QUOTE OR CITE
program. "Set asides" could be made available to those industries, workers or consumers who
experience a disproportionate share of the costs of control. A set aside could also be auctioned,
with the revenues used for the same purpose.


        Allocation Based On Baseline/Historical Emissions
       Under this approach, sources are given a number of permits based on baseline fuel
production or emissions and an allocation formula. Various allocation formulae can be devised,
weighted to greater or lesser degrees in favor of sources with high historical emissions.
Emissions allowances are endowed to facility operators for no cost and would be transferable.
Those receiving permits thus obtain assets of potentially large value from the government at no
cost.
          Such an allocation mechanism could create entry barriers. In a capital intensive sector like
primary fuel production, where entry barriers are already substantial, new entrants would be
further disadvantaged if they had to purchase permits - especially if existing holders hoard
permits. This problem could be mitigated by setting aside a number of permits for purchase by
new entrants or by auctioning a portion on the open market. Such an auction would also
facilitate price discovery in a new market. Although new firms will still be disadvantaged (as they
will pay for all of their permits), they would be able to enter the market. The pool of permits
would need to be withheld from existing sources to ensure compliance with budgeted national
emission levels.
        It may be desirable to design an allocation that would allow credit for early emissions
reductions (those achieved prior to the start of the program, but after the baseline period) -- in
particular for those that reduced greenhouse gas emissions as part of government sponsored
voluntary programs. If credits for past actions are given, the total credits allowed would need to .
be deducted from the overall permit allocation for the first budget period in order not to exceed
the national greenhouse gas emissions target. In addition, mechanisms may be necessary to
ensure veri fica tion of these credits.
       Auction
        Alternatively, an auction could be used to allocate permits. The price permit holders pay
would depend in part on the auction design or method used. Auctions ensure that permits
cannot be hoarded (a concern often expressed regarding allocation approaches), are available for
trade, and would serve to inform potential traders about current price levels. Auctions would put
new entrants on the same footing as existing emitters. As discussed earlier, since an auction
could produce substantial revenues, some decision would have to be made with respect to what
to do with the proceeds.
       Given that an auction could produce substantial revenues, some decision would have to

  be made with respect to what to do with the proceeds. They could be used exclusively to reduce
  taxes or the deficit. Alternatively, as discussed below, a portion of the revenues could be used to
, address inequities in the distribution of control costs and to fund R&D for less carbon intensive
  energy sources and end uses.


         Supporting Technological Progress and Transitions
           The allocation of permits, or the use of auction revenue, could be used to promote more
  rapid diffusion of existing climate-friendly technologies and accelerated R&D for new
'technologies. For example, a reserve of allowances could be set aside to encourage more rapid
  development and diffusion of low greenhouse gas emitting technologies. Manufacturers of
  energy consuming equipment could compete for the set aside based on the degree to which they
  produce, equipment more efficient than the average in use or than required by current mandatory
  efficiency standards. Such a program could yield reductions in energy demand and help buffer
  the consumer from the impact of higher energy costs. Similar results could be achieved with the
  use of auction revenue.
         Permit allocation formulae could take into account the market impacts of the mitigation
 program. Set asides could be made available to those industries, workers, or consumers who
 experience a disproportionate share of the costs of control. Auction revenues could also used for
 this purpose.
        C. Non-carbon greenhouse, gases
         Greenhouse gases include not only carbon dioxide, but also methane, nitrous oxides,
 hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Gases
 differ both in their atmospheric lifetimes and in their ability to trap heat in the atmosphere. In
 addition, carbon is not only emitted through the combustion offossil fuels, but is also absorbed
 by "sinks" such as trees and soils.
         Gases other than carbon dioxide account for the 15 of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.
Most important is methane, which accounts for 11 of national emissions. Since gases differ in
their lifetimes and in their potential to trap heat in the atmosphere, an "exchange rate" or trading
ratio must be established to convert all gases into common units for inclusion in a trading
program. Such ratios have been developed by climate researchers and could be applied here.
These should be consistent with the rules established in the international protocol.
         Several, although not all, of the many sources of non-carbon greenhouse gases could
likely be included in a trading system. For example, methane emitting coal mines, landfills,
livestock manure management facilities and potentially natural gas distribution systems may meet
the criteria described above for inclusion in a greenhouse gas trading program. These sources
account for 7 of national greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, emissions of some sources of

other gases could potentially be included (e.g., magnesium production).
        Forests in the United States currently remove an amount of carbon equal to 8 of national
emissions from the atmosphere. Their inclusion in the trading program would enhance the
system's flexibility, although there could be considerable methodological challenges with such an
approach.
