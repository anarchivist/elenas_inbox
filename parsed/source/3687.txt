TEXT:
We put it in the 9th point, which is called "lifelong learning."   As you
probably know, the school-to-work program provides work-based learning to
high school and college students, integrating academic and vocational
instruction. We thought the program best fit in the "lifelong learning"
section because of its job training aspect.  (The other initiative
discussed in that section is the GI Bill Skill Grant.)
