TEXT:
1.   I will; and
2.   Love to; and
3.   do you want to do a joint NPR/DPC process to look into the immigration
reforms that the commission will propose on Sept 30? Or do you want to do
it all yourself? , Or do you want to have nothing to do with it? We've set
up a meeting for tommorow with your npr folks, omb, and counsel's office,
so let me know what you want to do before then.   Bruce leans toward a
joint process, but he's more than willing to defer to your views on the
matter.
