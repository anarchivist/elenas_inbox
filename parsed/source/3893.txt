MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

FROM:

SUBJECT:                  PRODUCTS LIABILITY LEGISLA nON

        Congress may tum its attention to product liability legislation within the next month, and
we need to know how to respond. As you recall, your veto message last year detailed a number
of specific objections to the products bill. (The veto message is attached to this memo.) We
presume that if Congress were to give you the same bill again, you would veto it for the same
reasons. It is possible, however, that Congress will work to pass a bill that responds in part to .
your objections. This memo reviews those objections, outlines possible congressional responses
to them, and solicits your views on how to proceed. We believe that we should send strong
signals now about the kind of bill you would accept and the kind you would veto. We also think
that knowing early where you stand on the products bill will enable the Administration to
position itself correctly on other emerging law reform issues.

        One-way preemption. Prior to enumerating your objections to specific provisions in the
bill, your veto message noted the "general problem of displacing State authority in an unbalanced
manner." You explained that problem as follows: "As a rule, this bill displaces State law only
when that law is more favorable to consumers; it defers to State law when that law is more
helpful to manufacturers and sellers." Under the bill, for example, the "national" 15-year statute
of repose would have overridden the laws of states with longer or no statutes of repose, but
would have left in place all shorter statutes of repose; similarly, the bill would have limited
punitive damages in states that now allow unlimited punitive dam<;lges, but would not have
imposed punitive damages on states that do not now have them. Your veto statement continued:
"I cannot accept, absent compelling reasons, such a one-way street of federalism."

        If you hold fast to this position, you probably will have to veto another product liability
bill because Congress is unlikely to pass a bill that preempts, in identical fashion, both anti-
consumer and pro-consumer state law. For its strongest supporters, this bill is not so much about
achieving uniformity as about reducing liability burdens on manufacturers. Because a two-way
preemption bill will not clearly achieve this goal, your insistence on a two-way bill will signal
strongly that no compromise is possible.

        The objection to one-way preemption, however, is strong on the merits. If the problem
with the current tort system is a simple lack of uniformity, then two-way preemption is obviously
desirable. If the problem is instead that state law often fails to balance appropriately the interests
of manufacturers and consumers, then federal law should step in to strike that balance, negating


                                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

laws that tilt too much in either direction. One-way preemption is justified only ifthe goal is to
reduce product actions to the greatest extent possible, by enabling states to "pile on" to federal
limits.

       Because this issue is not amenable to compromise, we need to know soon where you
stand on it. We cannot develop a sound strategy before we know whether you could sign a bill
containing one-way preemption. If you could sign such a bill, we will de-emphasize the one-way
preemption concern and focus on the specific provisions ofthe statute discussed in the rest of this
memo.

        Eliminating joint liability for non-economic damages. Your veto message objected
strongly to the provision of the bill that wholly eliminated joint liability for non-economic
damages such as pain and suffering. You stated generally, in support of joint liability, that "when
one wrongdoer cannot pay its portion of the judgment, the other wrongdoers, and not the
innocent victim, should have to shoulder that part of the award." You also expressed doubt
about distinguishing economic from non-economic damages, noting that a provision limiting
only non-economic damages falls most heavily on non-working women, the elderly, the poor,
and children.

        This issue, unlike the last, is amenable to compromise. The most likely compromise
would be a proposal to eliminate joint liability for non-economic damages when, but only when,
the wrongdoer is responsible for less than some specified percentage of the total judgment.
Congress could say, for example, that joint liability for non-economic damages will not apply
when a defendant's actions have caused less than 25% of the total harm suffered. Congress
might try to compensate for this weakening of the joint liability provision by applying it to both
economic and non-economic damages (perhaps using your veto statement's equation of the two
kinds of damages to justify doing so), so that a "minor" wrongdoer would never have to shoulder
any costs not his own.

        A compromise of this kind has the apparent benefit of relieving small-scale wrongdoers
(how small depends on the percentage specified) of the obligation to pay the entirety of
potentially mammoth judgments. But by virtue of doing so, this compromise leaves innocent
victims to bear the damage themselves when primary wrongdoers have gone bankrupt or are
otherwise unable to satisfy judgments. You should consider whether you are comfortable with
this kind of compromise and, if so, approximately where (10 percent?; 25 percent?; 50 percent?)
you would draw the line.

        Capping punitive damages. You also objected in your veto statement to imposing caps on
punitive damage awards, on the ground that caps undermine the ability of punitive awards to
deter and punish egregious misconduct. You noted the provision of the bill allowing judges to
exceed the caps in specified circumstances, but stated that this protection was insufficient "given
the clear intent of Congress, as expressed in the Statement of Managers, that judges should use
this authority only in the most unusual cases."


                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                           3

             A compromise on this issue is also possible; indeed, it may be hard to avoid given the
     Administration's prior statements on the subject. The judicial override provision is essentially
     the brainchild of the Justice Department, which offered it as a way to alleviate our concerns
     about caps on punitives. If Congress deletes the legislative history to which you objected -- and
     especially ifit also softens some of the language in the override provision -- you will have little
     basis for continuing to object to the bill's punitive damage ceilings.

             Limiting liability ofbiomaterials suppliers. You expressed a "concern" in your veto
     statement about a provision in the bill limiting actions against suppliers of materials used in
     devices implanted in the body. You generally recognized this provision to be a "laudable attempt
     to ensure the supply of materials needed to make lifesaving medical devices." But you said that
     this limitation should apply only to non-negligent suppliers -- and not to suppliers who know or
     should know that the materials they make, when implanted in the human body, will cause injury.

              The current version of the biomaterials provision contains an exception for manufacturers
     of the silicone gel used in breast implants, but not an exception (of the kind you requested) for all
     negligent suppliers. Industry engaged in good-faith negotiations with Rep. Howard Berman last
     year to develop such an exception, but could not find a way to exempt negligent suppliers, while
     adequately protecting non-negligent suppliers from the high litigation costs associated with
     disproving negligence. Industry is currently looking into other ways to satisfy our concern -- for
     example, by limiting liability for biomaterials suppliers only when the FDA has reviewed and
     approved the implanted device -- and may well succeed in doing so. Indeed, we may wish to
     send a signal that Congress should remove this provision from the products bill, so that we can
     sign it separately.

              Other provisions. Your veto statement contained a number of objections to more minor
      provisions of the bill relating to the statute of repose, statutes ofiimitations, and negligent
      entrustment actions. With the possible exception of the statute of repose provision, compromise
      on thcse issues should be easy; members of Congress already have indicated a willingness to
      delete the offending language. On the statute of repose, the current bill precludes any suit
      alleging a defect in a product that is more than 15 years old; we could urge an I8-year statute of
      repose, as we accepted in the aviation liability bill you signed; alternatively, we could press for
    . some kind of exception from the statute of repose for products, such as farm equipment, intended
      to have a useful life of longer than 15 years.

              Other legislation. In the event you choose to reiterate your concerns and veto another
     products liability bill, you may have other opportunities to signal support for appropriate reform
     of the legal system. Senator Breaux plans to offer product liability legislation for people who do
     not like product liability legislation. This legislation would (1) strengthen pleading requirements
     for punitive damage claims and impose automatic sanctions for frivolous claims; (2) require
     states to adopt alternative dispute resolution programs and establish certain "offer of judgment"
     rules meant to promote settlements; (3) impose a nationwide standard for punitive damage
     awards (similar to the standard most states use now); (4) provide a uniform two-year statute of


                                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion


                                                                                                          4

         limitations; and (5) commission a Department of Justice study on the product liability system.

                 In another area of law reform, Sens. Lieberman, Moynihan, and McConnell have
         proposed a so-called "auto-choice" bill, which would allow a driver to select a no-frills auto
         policy that would reimburse him for all economic costs, but eliminate his option to sue for non-
         economic losses such as pain and suffering. Trial lawyers are certain to oppose this proposal, but
         unlike the products liability bill, it probably would benefit consumers. Some experts say that the
         savings for low-income drivers could reach 45 percent of their current insurance premiums -- and
         that the nationwide savings over two years could exceed $80 billion.
