TEXT:
Lois Schiffer says:
1. DOJ decided against a press release.    Shelley and Dinah are in the midst of
preparing some talking points for Lois to take with her to Oregon.   I have left
a msg for Dinah to fax these to me.
2.   Lois is not calling Harold today because after reviewing the procedural
posture, she does not think anything could happen tomorrow on the enjoined
sales, and she thinks she will be able to report more fully in a day or so.
 (The thinking here, which seems right to me, is that even if Hogan rules against
us, Dwyer still must lift his injunction -- and that won't happen for a little
while.)   At any rate, she does know that she must talk to Harold before
releasing any sales -- and that she must give him a reasonable amount of time to
make a decision.
