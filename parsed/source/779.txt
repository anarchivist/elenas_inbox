    Subject:         Tuskegee

    Looking at the materials on Tuskegee, it seems that we need to make some
    decisions to move the process forward:

     1. Exactly what is the substance of this event: that is, in addiiton to
    an "apology" from the President, what are the policy corrections or
    announcements' that would be made and who would be resposnible for
    implementing them ? I think I remember something going to the Bioethics
    Commission --what else? Has DPC signed off on a package?

    2. What are the options for the President's time? One hour is going to be
    very hard to find. How important is it that the President be there
    personally, or can we find a way to release his letter + policy? Can we
    offer a range of options that make it easier on scheduling ?

     A related question: where are we on announcing the next surgeon General ?
    Could this event be handled --not as part of his announcement    but as a
    subject he takes up immediately upon assuming office?

     3. I raise these questions not because I think the event ·is less
    important but becaues I do think it imprtant to taek some action and am
    concerned that the constraints on the President's time mean we have to be
    creatiev in thinking how to achieve it.
