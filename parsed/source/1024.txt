I just spoke with folks at Education.  They now expect the IDEA vote to
come in a clump of votes in the House after 5 pm.   In the Senate, it looks
like the final vote may get pushed to tomorrow.   Senators Gorton and
Gordon Smith are each expected to offer amendments, which will then entail
2 hours of debate and a roll call vote. At least one of the amendments is
likely to pertain to discipline. Neither is expected to derail the bill
as a whole.

Bottom line~-at the moment, it looks as if final passage in the Senate
won't come until tomorrow, although the House will vote today.  We will
need to decide whether to hold off on the press release until both have
voted.
