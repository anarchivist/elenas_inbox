TEXT:
The last time we spoke about this issue, we planned for Erskine to host a
meeting with Gil Gallegos.   The problem now is that Gallegos is furious
with us and won't do this meeting.   He just won reelection by a very small
margin after a campaign in which he took a lot of grief for his
relationship with us.  I recommend getting a decision on this issue now,
without a meeting.  We can have a decision memo for Erskine or anyone else
this week. Agreed?
