Subject: Stem cell research

I want to urge that we try to redefine the stem cell/cloning debate.    The
term "embryo" is being used too broadly, to the advantage of our
right-to-life opponents, and to the harm of patients who could benefit
from prohibited research.   The letter Potus sent Shapiro implies embryos
are being created where they are not.    We should seek consensus that
remodeling (turning back on all of the genes) of DNA from a human somatic
cell does not produce an embryo (even when scientists fuse a somatic cell
with what was once an egg -- "once" because with its nucleus removed the
egg is merely a chemical factory that is being used to turn on genes) .
Embryo in this debate should be reserved for "the pre fetal product of
human conception (Webster's II)." For there to be an embryo there must be
conception -- creation of a potential human being. Despite Dolly, it is
only a theory that the DNA in a human somatic cell can be remodeled to
produce a human being. We should state without reservation that we oppose
human cloning, but we should not ban various techniques and processes
because such techniques and processes might make cloning more likely.    We
should stop affixing the term embryo to reactivating an individual's DNA
for the purposes of producing cell lines or tissue for therapeutic uses.
I recognize redefining the debate at this stage will be difficult.
Sensational coverage of cloning has created a powerful lens through which
the public views the stem cell debate. Too many experts have fallen into
the trap of labeling remodeled somatic cells as embryos. But it is
possible to draw a bright line between conception and reactivating somatic
cells even when it involves components from eggs.
