Do you think we give the drug treatment option short shrift (by not even
counting it as a full-fledged option)? HHS hates all the compromise
approaches.  Why should we let its objections transform this approach into
a non-option option?==================== ATTACHMENT   1 ====================

       MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

       FROM:                     Bruce Reed

       SUBJECT:                  Needle Exchange

              This memo presents you with several options on needle exchange, based on our prior
       discussions with you. It also provides further information on the positions of constituency
       groups and policy experts.

               As you know elite opinion runs strongly in favor of needle exchange. Most scientists and
       public health experts who have studied the question also agree with HHS's conclusion that
       needle exchange decreases HIV transmission while not increasing drug use; (It is impossible to
       prove whether needle exchange programs actually reduce drug use, because it would be unethical
       to run a controlled experiment that compares addicts who have access to clean needles with
       addicts who do not.) Dr. Koop has a more complicated view. As Surgeon General, he visited a
       number of programs in Europe and concluded that (1) needle programs are not uniformly
       effective, but there is no evidence that they attract non-addicts to drugs; and (2) needle programs
       will not be very effective here, because most addicts are so far outside the mainstream that they
       will not show up reliably to exchange needles.

               The AIDS community and the anti-drug community are miles apart. We might be able to
       muster half-hearted support from the Human Rights Campaign for the compromise options listed
       below, but most groups will be very disappointed if we do not accept Secretary Shalala's
       recommendation. (Of course, if we do accept this recommendation and Congress reverses the
       action, we will have to veto the bill in order to retain the groups' support.) Conversely, anti-drug
       advocates are likely to oppose needle exchange as strongly as they do drug legalization.

              The options are:

               1. Let Shalala certify and release funds. After certifying that needle exchange decreases
       HIV transmission and does not increase drug use, HHS could release the funds in any of three
       ways: (a) by publishing an interim final regulation, which would allow federal funds to flow to a
       community as soon as that community meets the qualifying criteria specified in the regulation;
       (b) by publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking, which would require a public comment period
       and would not take effect for two or three months; and c) by publishing program guidance, which
       would be accompanied by a similar comment period. The lagtime in options (b) and c) would
       give Congress time to overturn the decision to fund needle exchange programs prior to the
       distribution of any monies.


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Conversion
 ",.




               You had asked whether HHS could require, as a condition of funding, that communities
       confine their needle exchange programs to individuals actually participating in drug treatment.
       As a legal matter, HHS could take this action. HHS argues, however, that doing so would be bad
       public health policy, because it would discourage the most at-risk addicts from taking part in
       needle exchange programs. The AIDS groups are likely to share this view.

               In addition, Elizabeth Birch from HRC has suggested that you could allow HHS to certify
       and then say nothing, one way or the other, about releasing federal funds. This approach,
       however, is difficult to understand. Nothing can be done quietly with respect to this issue.
       Either the Administration will release federal funds, in which case the approach is the same as
       Shalala's recommendation -- or the Administration will not release funds, in which case it begins
       to look much like option (3) below.

                2. Let Shalala certify, but limit federal funds to a few demonstration cities. After
       certifying that needle exchange decreases HIV transmission and does not increase-drug use, HHS
       would pick a number of communities (say,S or 10) for needle exchange "demonstrations." You
       would ask Shalala (perhaps with General McCaffrey) to study and report whether these
       demonstration programs work before releasing funding to any other communities. Members of
       Congress will find it harder to attack this approach than Option (1), because it does not constitute
       an endorsement of needle programs -- just a commitment to testing them. But HHS argues that
       (a) we do not need "demonstrations," because we already know that needle exchange works, and
       (b) all federally funded needle exchange programs are in some sense demonstrations, because all
       communities will have to submit evaluations of their programs to the Secretary. In addition, the
       AIDS community may give us scant credit for this limited release of funds, although Richard
       Socarides believes that the community would prefer this compromise approach to the one
       detailed below.

               3. Let Shalala certify, but withhold federal funds. After HHS certifies that needle
       exchange decreases HIV transmission and does not increase drug use, you would announce the
       withholding of federal funds until Shalala and McCaffrey have had time to build a national
       consensus on the issue or to study the best ways of reconciling public health and drug control
       policies. Of all the options described in this memo, this approach is the least likely to provoke a
       Congressional response, because you have not actually released any funds for needle exchange
       programs. For the exact same reason, however, the AIDS community will like this approach the
       least. And as you heard at your meeting with her, Shalala also strongly opposes this option. .




                                                                     Automated Records Management System
                                                                     Hex-Dump Conversion
