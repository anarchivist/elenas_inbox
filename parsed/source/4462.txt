Subject: SOTU Process

DPC staff have asked for a timeline post this week's project on new
ideas.  For example, when do we want to submit an options memorandum to
POTUS.

Second, Elena, folks have asked if you could make it clear at the NEC-DPC
Deputies meeting that the agencies should be working through NEC and DPC
staff.  Apparently there is some confusion in the agencies about
processes.  When need to make it clear to them that there is one process.

Subject: High-tech ideas

Our list of ideas is light on science and technology ideas, which is
unfortunate, since this will be the last State of the Union of the
Milennium.     In addition to Chris's crusade against Superbug, we might
cons ider :. 1) smart gun technology; 2) gun detectors; 3) more high - tech
wrinkles in our child support crackdown; 4) the next idea in education
technology; 5) an adoption registry; 6) cures for the various diseases
that will plague the globe once the new Milennium hits; etc.    We should
also think about some possible consumer-oriented responses to this
technological advance -- privacy protections, etc.

Anybody who comes up with a good high tech idea wins a free clock radio.

We're going to submit a joint DPC-NEC new ideas memo to the President next
week. Hence the urgency of finishing a draft.

We met with Maria today.  She did not reveal any ulterior process, but
we'll send a clear message anyway.

Subject: Two more thoughts reo WTW bonus

1) A bonus formula which only rewards unsubsidized employment (i.e.
excludes even subsidies paid with TANF funds) may disproportionately
affect those areas and populations the WTW funds were intended to serve,
i.e. concentrated poverty and hardest to serve. While we don't yet have
hard data on how much subsidized employment is occuring with TANF funds,
it may be used more where it's harder for someone to get an unsubsidized
job.   Also, it may take longer for people to move from subsidized to
unsubsized jobs where the economy is worse or the individuals have more
barriers. Given the one-shot, short-term time frame for the WTW bonus,
we'd penalize these places by only counting unsubsidized placements.

2) Just a reminder that it was never our intention to reward fully
subsidized jobs, i.e. workfare. The TANF bonus only rewards jobs that are
less than 100% subsidized, and it's always been our intent to do the same
here.  In other words, the employer is paying someone $6.00 hour, but gets
a subsidy that partially offsets these costs (typically a cash out of the
person's welfare check).   I'm pretty sure OMB knows this at a staff
level, but just wanted to make you had this info if it should come up with


Jack.

Subject:  Re: Poverty Measures

I read the memo.  My position would still be, we should stay out of this,
let Census do what Census is planning to do.  The more we meddle, the
sooner we're going to get drawn into the benchmarking debate, where we
don't want to be.  The 2000 Census is already a time bomb for us.   It was
the one issue that came closest to destroying the budget agreement.   If we
start getting Robert Pear stories about White House Considers Raising
Poverty Rate, the Republicans will go nuts to blow up the Census, the Dems
will go nuts in the other direction, and we'll be stuck counting dead
bodies.  We should stay a million miles away from this, and not meddle in
any distributional issues.

Even if that weren't the case, I still think non-benchmarking is a big
mistake for this President.  He's presided over a big reduction in poverty
over his term.  We shouldn't turn around at the end and leave everyone
with the impression that things have actually gotten worse.  The poverty
rate is an arbitrary, imperfect measure -- and if we change it, it will
still be an arbitrary, imperfect measure, just bigger.

I'll talk to Gene.

Subject: Re: Poverty Measures

I definitely, positively agree with your opinion and reasons for it -- and
would like to add an additional one.

One of the more controversial aspects of these new thresholds is the
subtraction of out -of -pocket medical expenditures f.rom resources.  This
creates a large change in the nature of the "poor"     -- more sick people
would classified as poor due to medical expenses.

This has, among others, two bad effects.  First, it makes Medicaid
participation / coverage rates look worse, since we have encourage
Medicaid to move towards an income-related health insurance program
irrespective of health status.    Second, it would now appear that many
more seniors are poor, since they have the highest out of pocket health
expenditures.  This has large ramifications for Medicare policies   (e.g.
premium assistance programs, polici~s).  While this direct link between
health spending and poverty might put us in a better position to advocate
for additional health policies, we already have enough problems to deal
with.

I will take these issues up with Gene as well through the NEC process
 (which I have not been a part of, until now) .

Jeanne

Subject: conspiracies

According to the February 9, 1998 issue of Newsweek, a
          tobacco lobbyist named WILLIAM HECHT helped place
          LINDA TRIPP in a White House job during the Bush
          Administration. After the 1992 election, Tripp stayed on at
          the white House as a "confidential assistant" to white
          House advisor BERNIE NUSSBAUM, a senior member of
          WACHTEL LIPTON ROSEN & KATZ, which happens
          to be one of the leading law firms representing the tobacco
          industry.    . Later, after Tripp had accumulated a complete
          collection of Lewinsky tapes, she turned the tapes over to
          another partner of Wachtel Lipton named GEORGE
          CONWAY, who gave them to one James MOODY (who,
          to our knowledge, has no tobacco connection), who gave
          them to STARR. Conway was the author of the brief that
          persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the PAULA
          JONES case to proceed . . . Another mysterious
          coincidence occurred when VERNON JORDAN, a
          member of RJR Nabisco's Board of Directors and President
          Clinton's supposed friend, agreed to help MONICA
          LEWINSKY find a job in New York. According to
          Newsweek, Jordan got her an interview at
          BURSON-MARSTELLER, a public relations firm that
          happens to have Philip Morris as a long-standing client and
          is currently managing the grass roots movement in
          California to overturn the smoking ban in bars.
