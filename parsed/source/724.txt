         It looks basically OK to me but needs a bit of work; it will certainly go
         through several iterations with us, Don, before it gets sent to the
         President.

         FYI, you will note that the VP /Elaine is interested in doing something
         the week of April 14th on Texas Comptroller John Sharp's commitment, which
         is to pair volunteers to 1,000 families trying to leave welfare.  Sharp's
         commitment has already been announced. But we might use such an event to
         annouce a federal commitment on welfare -" either something on afterschool
         programs, which a lot of community groups are interested in, or maybe
         something modeled on Sharp.   I am talking to HHS and to Cynthia about 0
         ptions here.
