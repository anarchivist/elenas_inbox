Sorry to be pestering, but Maria is trying to push this process quickly,
so I need any comments that you have on other sections, like civil
rights.

I will need to pull a meeting or meetings together at staff level this
week to see what can be sorted through and what can't be. As I mentioned,
I'm meeting with Terry this afternoon to work through as much as we can on
the first half of the book.  That obviously won't get to the areas of
policy and message where there are serious disagreements.  I wouldn't be
surprised if there were a POTUS meeting as early as next week.   Also, I
need a copy of memo on Education and Crime chapters that is suitable for sh
owing to Maria, who asked to see comments I've received.  I haven't given
her anything from DPC.  tds
