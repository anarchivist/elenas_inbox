Looks like Maria will tell ADAPT we will meet with them next Wednesday.
Hence I am trying to schedule a premeeting.  ADAPT says they want Bruce
and Gene there, but obviously we'll discuss.

Subject: ADAPT Protesting at Depart of Labor

We sent a letter to ADAPT last night inviting them to participate in a
meeting with the President on September 10, 1997.   They said only one page
came through the fax.   Instead of calling to ask to resend, they instead
are at the Department of Labor demanding to meet with Alexis.   I've talked
with Lee Satterfield, sent her Maria's letter to ADAPT, and am working to
get Maria to call them.
