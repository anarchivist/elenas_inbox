    Very interesting--it is always amazing how if you keep asking questions,
    you keep finding out more. Keep me posted--and I'll just let Him know
    that you all are working on it, and pushing hard on it.

   Subject:         NEW Update on Arkansas child support

   In response to our questions, HHS has discovered an embarrasing (to them)
   fact but one that should help us provide the President a response more to
   his liking:  since 1992, HCFA has been interpreting the same regulation
   differently in Medicaid cases than ACF has been for child support. HCFA
   has been allowing federal match for computer systems without prior
   approval in certain limited circumstances (if the transaction would have
   been approved had prior approval been sought and if the state agrees to
   institute controls to ensure prior approval requirements are met in the
   future.)  Rather astounding that they didn't discover this before Kevin
   met with the Governor.  Anyway, HHS is pulling together their key people
   now to work through the implications of having a uniform agency wide
   policy (if ACF uses the HCFA rules for Arkansas, they may be subject to
   lawsuits from states they've turned down in the past). We've suggested
   some other possibilities too (using TANF or SSBG funds, spreading payments
   out over 10 quarters) for which they are examining the implications.  I'll
   push them and keep you posted.  Call me if you'd like to discuss (62846)

   Subject:         Update on Arkansas child support

   Bruce asked me to send you a note on Arkansas child support.  We're
   finishing a memo to the President but are pushing HHS to come up with some
   more responsive options.

   Here's where things stand.

   HHS policy since 1986 has been to deny federal match for contracts for
   which states have not received prior approval.  They have never made an
   exception -- in fact during the last year, they've taken this position
   with California, Hawaii, Kansas, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and
   West Virginia. The contracts under dispute are for child support computer
   systems. The rationale for requiring federal approval is to ensure the
   contracted services meet basic programmatic requirements before the
   federal government commits to pay 66 percent or more of their costs.

   Arkansas does not dispute that they didn't submit the contract for federal
   review early enough. But they've asked that the penalty be reduced or
   waived. HHS agrees that if the contract had been submitted earlier they
   would have approved it.  However, HHS strongly opposes making an
   exception, even in this case.

   As I said, we are working with HHS to develop some better options ASAP
   we'll send you more on that shortly. One issue to consider: there is
   apparently an on-going FBI investigation of child support contracts in
   Arkansas, related to contracts being awarded to members of the state
   legislature. The Lexis/Nexis search I did pulled up dozens of articles
   mentioning the investigation, which apparently began in November 1997 with
   a raid of State Senator Nick Wilson's office. As a result of the
   publicity surrounding this investigation, the legislature passed and
   Huckabee has signed into law new ethics rules. However, according to the
   press, the investigation is on-going, under the direction of US Attorney
   Paula Casey.  I'm not saying that I have any indication that there's a
   connection between the contracts for which the state didn't see federal
   approval and this investigation, but I just wanted to flag for you that
   the issue of child support enforcement contracts in the state is under a
   great deal of scrutiny right now.
