TEXT:
We're not all that crazy about the draft guidance.   It's pretty confusing
-- e.g., it asks lots of questions, but leaves many of them wholly
unanswered.  Counsel's office -- and, I think, DOJ -- are concerned that
its lack of clarity will encourage institutions to continue practices that
are in fact unlawful '(or conversely, steer clear of practices that are
perfectly justifiable).   I think counsel's office also had some concerns
about the extent to which civil rights groups (as opposed to education
groups) were briefed on/involved in this document (i.e., perhaps not
enough).  We're still talking with counsel's office, and it may be that we
can make sufficient improvements in the document today to feel comfortable
about releasing it.  But right now, we're leaning against it -- especially
given that release of the document (unlike, say, announcement of the HUD
policy) won't generate much in the way of positive news.
