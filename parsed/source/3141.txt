TEXT:
1. This proposed EO probably looks more impresive than it is.    Large parts of
it are identical to the current EO on Civil Justice Reform.   Only a handful of
provisions have been amended.   If you want I can send you a redlined version
 (which I thought OMB would circulate) making clear exactly what is different.
2.   The most important change concerns the ability of the government to enter
into binding arbitration.   The current EO does not allow the government to enter
into binding arbitration; this position reflects a longstanding OLC view that
the acceptance of binding arbitration violates the appointments clause.   The new
EO reverses this position, based on a recent OLC analysis concluding that
binding arbitration raises no appointments clause concern.
3. The proposed EO also removes certain provisions on attorneys' fees meant to
discourage plaintiffs from bringing suit to enforce civil rights, environmental,
and similar statutes; and it corrects the restatement of law on the
admissibility of expert testimony to reflect the S. Ct. 's recent opinion in
Daubert v. Merrell Dow.
4. Notwithstanding the cover sheet from OMB, John Schmidt's office really
prepared this EO.   But for some reason, John and Ab agreed that we would do the
processing.
5.   I know that John would like to do a lot to publicize this.  He thinks the EO
fits perfectly with recent ADR efforts that have been receiving a great
reaction.   What do you think?
