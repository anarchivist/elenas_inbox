      Subject:         response to HHS's argument about Medicaid

      From Chris as well:


      HHS argues that a decision about state action in Medicare is not
      applicable to Medicaid because Medicare beneficiaries can always return to
      fee-far-service, while Medicaid beneficiaries cannot not.   (Note: Under
      the BBA, by 2001, beneficiaries will be locked into managed care plans for
      nine months from when they join the plan) .

      Medicaid is not that different from Medicare -- millions of Medicaid
      beneficiaries have a choice of managed care or fee-for-service.

              Only 2 states have 100 percent of beneficiaries in managed care
      (Tennessee and Washington).   States need 1115 waivers to require
      Medicare-Medicaid D&dual eligiblesD8 and children with special needs to
      join Medicaid managed care plans.   In 10 states, less than 25 percent of
      beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care.

              Half (25) of states do not enroll any elderly or disabled Medicaid
      beneficiaries in managed care.  This, plus the choice of fee-for-service
      for some adults and children account for the fact that 50 percent of
      Medicaid beneficiaries are not enrolled in managed care.

       Absurd to make the case based on whether a beneficiary chooses managed
      care.  In Medicaid, some children with special needs can choose but cannot
      be forced to enroll in managed care -- while healthy children may be
      required to enroll.  Under HHSD,s logic, it would be alright to have no
      private right of action for the sick child whose parentsO, chose managed
      care but not alright to take away the right of action from the healthy
      child.

      Some Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibles are enrolled in managed care.  For
      some elderly and people with disabilities, Medicare covers their basic
      health services and Medicaid pays for prescription drugs, Medicare cost
  sharing, etc.  In this situation, the managed care plan could be sued as a
  state actor in Medicaid but not in Medicare.
