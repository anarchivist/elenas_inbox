    TEXT:
    sounds good -- why don't you and Cynthia take a crack at (2) and (3).   I
    don'.t think (1) is quite right, though it's close.  We should make clear
    what the key goal is (reducing kids' smoking); stress the price increase
    the most; and stick with our five principles.   Relatedly, we shouldn't so
    elevate second-hand smoke.

    I think the agenda is good.   I think we need a couple of tangible products
    that can be distributed to officials speaking for the Administration: (1)
    a common theme statement that everyone uses on why we need the bill --
    like Medicare, Medicaid, Education, and the Environment (a crack at it is
    below);   (2) uniform responses to common attacks on the bill that we know
    from polling works; and (3) being prepared for rapid response generally --
    including creating lists of issues and target reporters to get materials
    and responders to.


    1. Identify a common theme.

    The most popular list of reasons for a bill I have is: ads, FDA, second
    hand smoke, and $1. 50 with net lives saved.

     "We need strong comprehensive legislation that stops advertising to kids,
    regulates nicotine under the FDA like the drug it is, and restricts deadly
    second-hand smoke that kills non-smokers.  If we do these things and raise
    the cost of cigarettes by $1.50 a pack with tough penalties on companies
    we can save xx million kids over the next 5 years."

    2.   Need Defenses on Issues such as:

          Drugs

          Lawyers Fees

          Black market

              Immunity

          Medicare, tax cuts, other spending ideas

              skinny bill would work fine


3. Rapid Response-- monitoring, preparation of answers, and response to
targeted reporters


4.            Background to Communications

* people want stern measures
* Saying our bill does everything a skinny bill does and more, beats the
skinny bill (simple but true).

*         Public believes we need more than a $1 a pack increase.

* Tying opposition to the tobacco industry controlling Congress or R's
playing politics works but might cut against bipartisanship so should be
used carefully.
