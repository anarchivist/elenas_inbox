TEXT:
Mark mentioned to me on Friday that the Wall St Journal had promised us space to
(E'spond to ics editorial and suggested that Hazard convert his opinion letter
into a letter.   I talked to Hazard about the idea this morning.  Hazard doesn't
want to write a letter himself.   Instead, he wants Jack (or someone else in the
counsel's office) to write a letter, indicating that we asked an independent
expert (the most eminent independent expert etc. etc.) to give us an opinion and
then quoting as much of that opinion as we want. This seems OK to me, and I do
think it's the only thing Hazard is comfortable with.   Do we go ahead, and if so
who writes the letter, and what would that person (Jack? Jane?) like it to say?
