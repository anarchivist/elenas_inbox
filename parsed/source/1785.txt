TEXT:
Not canceled.   (Did Chris and I misunderstand each other? I told him the
budget meting with the President was canceled.)   You have to deal with
OMB. We're counting on you to make sure their numbers are honest (i.e.,
that the tables show how great the price increase would have to be in
order to fund both nih and a $5 billion discretionary pot). Thanks much,
and sorry if I've cost you any time.
