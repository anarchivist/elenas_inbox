Subject:         Stenholm's guy

Ed Lorenzin (sp?) of Stenholm's office left me a voice mail late Friday to
ask what's going on. Ken, I know you have been talking to him, so I wanted
to check in to make sure we weren't tripping over each other.  Let me know
if there is anything special I should know when I call him back.  He said
he was calling to find out what was going on; that the Governor had called
Stenholm to ask him about the status; and that Stenholm was expecting a
call from Shalala that day.
