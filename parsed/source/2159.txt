Subject:         early childhood study

Saturday's New York Times has an article by Tamar Lewin entitled "Early
Aid is Shown to Benefit At-Risk Children".  The story cites a RAND study
that showed several positive results from nine early intervention programs
studied, including higher long-term school achievement, less need for
special ed, lower delinquency rates, fewer emergency room visits and less
dependency on welfare.

There must be a way we can use this, or refer to this, or do an event
around this. How can we use this to promote POTUS' agenda?
