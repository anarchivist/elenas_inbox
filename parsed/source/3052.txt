TEXT:
Teresa Roseborough from OLC called me to say that the Senate welfare bill (you
know, the one we said on Saturday we would accept) includes a provision denying
benefits to any person who is not a natural-born US citizen (including
naturalized US citizens).  OLC has opined that the provision is unconstitutional
(which seems pretty clear to me).  Is there anything we should be doing about·
this?
