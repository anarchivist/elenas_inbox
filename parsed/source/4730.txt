1.   Victor Schwartz called to tell me he was sending us another memo on

products reform -- this one dealing more with politics, and less with

substance.    During our conversation, he proposed that Jack convene a

meeting

that both he (Schwartz) and the new President of ATLA would attend --

presumably to see if there is any common ground.    I don't see any reason

to do

this right now, but it is something to keep in mind.



2.   Per your note, Jack, I told Mark Gittenstein that you would be happy

to

meet -- after the transition -- with him and a bunch of high-tech types

interested in securities reform.
