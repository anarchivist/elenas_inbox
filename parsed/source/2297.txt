        Elena,
        Yesterday, Maria convened a follow-up meeting with the LCCR folks to
        discuss our civil rights enforcement initiatives.  wade asked for a higher
        profile for our civil rights enforcement package.  Maria and Minyon agreed
        that they would try to incorporate support for the cr package (as a
        package) in upcoming principal events.  Next week the VP is speaking at
        the NAACP and the FLOTUS is speaking at La Raza.  These were identified as
        two opportunities.

        Wade also indicated the LCCR's intention to draft a letter to the
        Congressional leadership + committee members outlining the "package"
        concept and expressing strong support for the increases in the President's
        budget.  Though this sort of sets them up in a way that may make them a
        target ("here is all the stuff that is important to us"), they believe
        that it would be an important rallying tool.  Wade also indicated that
        LCCR plans to work on getting a bi-partisan letter from members of
        Congress and former EEOC commissioners expressing support for the use of
        employment testers.

        Subject: H1B    question

        This afternoon, Sally is holding a meeting to decide whether the
Administration should release a statement of some kind that says that
senior advisors would recommend a veto of a bill that increases the H1B
cap without strong reforms and some kind of training component. As you
remember, when the Abraham bill went to the Senate floor, we sent a
statement that the Secretary of Labor would recommend a veto (b/c no
decent reforms and no fee for training).   On the House side, we have
supported Smith's bill and, when it reached the full Judiciary committee,
sent a letter stating that the Administration would strongly oppose any
amendments to weaken the reforms.   In that letter, we also stated that the
bill would receive our strong support if it included a training provision
and a modest reduction in the increase.

Last night, Gene had a conversation with the head of the National
Association of Manufacturers and got the sense that a strong statement by
the Administration of our prerequisites fpr supporting a bill would be
helpful (i.e., if business knows that we are serious about vetoing a bill
that doesn't have decent reforms or training, they will be more likely to
put pressure on the Republicans to present us with a bill that includes
both -- they continue to want a bill) .

The question for us is would we recommend a veto of a bill that didn't
include training or decent reforms.  If the answer remains "yes", should
we issue such a statement? Of course, we will not know exactly what the
bill will look like, but it would be useful to be able to say that with no
training component or no decent reforms, we would recommend a veto (that
either one, on its own, wouldn't be enough). What do you think?

Subject: Republicans Trying To Kill Gay Order

San Francisco Chronicle, July 8, 1998
(http://www.sfgate.com)

Republicans Trying To Kill Gay Order
Clinton barred discrimination
Louis Freedberg, Chronicle Washington Bureau
     Several Republican lawmakers, including House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,


  are trying to block an executive order issued by President Clinton three
 months ago barring discrimination against gays in the federal government.
The
 move represents the latest in a series of recent political attacks
emanating
  from GOP circles on gays and gay rights, including continuing opposition
to
 the nomination of San Francisco philanthropist James Hormel to be
ambassador
 to Luxembourg. Hormel is openly gay and a leading supporter of gay causes.
 Clinton's executive order, which was hailed by gay advocacy groups, added
 sexual orientation to the federal government's policy barring
discrimination
 on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or
 age. Some federal agencies had already adopted such a policy, but it was
 applied inconsistently across the federal government.
      Conservative organizations, led by the Family Research Council, are
 incensed at the order and are urging Republicans to move against it. They
 argue that Clinton has overreached his executive authority and is trying
to
 create "institutional quotas"    on behalf of gays.
      In response to their lobbying efforts, Representative Joel Hefley, R-
 Colo., will attach an amendment to a funding bill when the House
reconvenes
 next week that would forbid the federal government from spending any
money on
 enforcing Clinton's order. So far, there are no estimates on the cost of
 implementing it.
      "Bill Clinton has added a new category to the nation's civil rights
 laws, " Hefley said. "Apparently, he has decided to rule by executive
order.
 The last time I checked, amending federal law was. Congress' job, not that
of
 the executive branch. ' ,
      He and three colleagues, including DeLay, R-Texas, sent a letter to
other
 lawmakers arguing that "while we do not support discrimination, we also
do
 not believe in giving special protected status because of sexual
orientation,
 or for most other reasons."
      Richard Socarides, a spokesman for Clinton, said the president is
 "disturbed" by what he described as an effort to "pass a law that permits
 discrimination. ' ,
      He linked the attempt to block the anti-discrimination measure with
the
 refusal of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to allow the full Senate to
vote
 on Hormel. The heir to the Hormel Meat Packing Co. fortune was approved
by the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee in November. But Hormel's nomination
has
 languished since then, despite pressures on Lott from scores of Democrats
and
 key Republicans, including Senators Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Orrin
 Hatch of Utah, to let the philanthropist's name go forward.
      'THE BIBLE IS CLEAR'
      Last month, Hormel's chances seemed to diminish considerably when
Lott,
 R-Miss., compared homosexuality with afflictions such as kleptomania and
 alcoholism. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R.-Texas, promptly endorsed
 Lott's comments, saying, "The Bible is very clear on this."
      Gay advocacy groups reacted strongly to the Republicans' move. "It is


not
 coincidental that Hefley's amendment is happening with the fall elections
upon
 us, " said Tracey Conaty, a spokesperson for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task
 Force in Washington, D.C. "It is an effort to score cheap political points
 against a minority community. ' ,
      Conaty accused opponents of the anti-discrimination measure of "lies
and
 deceptions"   by inaccurately saying it calls for quotas on behalf of gays.
      Steve Schwalm of the Family Research Council, the organization that
 drummed up support against Clinton's executive order, conceded that the
 measure does not specifically call for quotas. But he said it calls on
heads
 of all federal agencies to institute "affirmative programs"   promoting
"equal
 employment"   of gays. "We all know that affirmative action programs
result in
 quotas, " he said.
      GAY ACTIVISTS OPTIMISTIC
      Gay advocates said they believe that they can defeat the move to
overturn
 the executive order. Winney Stachelberg, legislative director for the
Human
 Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay advocacy organization, said
surveys
 taken by her organization show that there is considerable support for
policies
 prohibiting employment discrimination against gays. In fact, she said, the
 majority of lawmakers on Capitol Hill have instituted pOlicies in their
own
 offices prohibiting such discrimination.
     As for Hormel, Lott's office staunchly refuses to say whether the
Senate
 will be allowed to vote on his nomination. "It hasn't been scheduled yet,
and
 right now the schedule is very tight, " a spokesperson said.
      Senator Dianne Feinstein, D- Calif., who has been leading the lobbying
 effort on behalf of Hormel, said she refuses to believe that the
nomination is
 dead. ·"The majority leader has never said to me it is dead,"  she said,
 referring to Lott. "And I take him at his word.' ,
