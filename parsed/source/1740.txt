Per your request, sorry I did't see the note earlier.

6th Grade Mentoring Initiative. The NEC has begun consultations with the
higher education community on a proposal that would promote partnerships
between colleges and high-poverty schools, to provide youth with sustained
mentoring and academic enrichment starting no later than seventh grade and
extending through high school graduation. This would be connected to a
broader effort to inform low-income families about financial aid that is
available for college.   [While we would not be able to announce the size
of any intitiative until after the budget process, you could announce the
general idea and ask for colleges to work with us on the design. One
opportunity to do that would be on November 16 and 17, when 2000
officials from all of the public 4-year colleges and universities in the
country will be meeting in D.C.]
