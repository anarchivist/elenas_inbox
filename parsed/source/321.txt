Subject:         Tobacco mtg. W/A.G. Humphrey's staff

At John Hart's request, I'm meeting w/A.G. Humphrey's staff Thursday to
hear their perspective on rumored tobacco legislation deals.   Humphrey is
leading an AG effort to outline legislation acceptable to AGs in case AGs
are asked for a bottom line.  Toby Donenfeld of VP's office will join me
Thursday.

 We used to have strong WH counsel involvement in tobacco;     should I
include someone from Counsel at tomorrow's meeting?
