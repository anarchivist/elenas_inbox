                                     For Legal Immigrants


The following procedures are for legal immigrants who believe that they have a work history that
meets the forty quarters exemption in the law. These procedures need not be followed for those
legal immigrants who qualify for other exemptions in the law (refugees, asylees, deportees, or
applicants with a claim to eligibility based on military service.)

Second para -- In order to determine eligibility based on social security coverage, the state should
ascertain the applicant's understanding as to the following:

        I.How many years has the applicant, the applicant's spouse,. or the applicant's parents
              (before the applicant turned 18) lived in this county.

(If the answer to question I is less than 10 years, the State agency does not need to ask question
                2).

        2.In how many of the years reported in answer to question 1, did the applicant, the
               applicant's spouse, or the applicant's parent earn money through work.

(To determine whether the applicant's earnings were sufficient to establish "quarters of
              coverage" in those years, the State agency may wish to refer to the attached
              chart)

If the answer to the question 2 is 10 years or more, the State agency shall verify, from INS
documents, the date of entry into the country ofthe applicant, spouse and/or parent. If the dates
are consistent with having 10 or more years of work, no further documentation is required at this
time; the State agency shall include the immigrant in the household pending verification from
SSA. The State agency shall inform these recipients that a claim will be established for any
benefits to which they were not entitled. The State agency shall keep a record of each individual
certified pending verification from SSA.

If the dates of entry are inconsistent with having 10 or more years of work, the State agency shall
determine the applicant ineligible. The State agency shall then inform the applicant of his or her
fair hearing rights.

The applicant shall also provide, for purposes of future verification, the full name, Social
Security Number, date of birth, and sex of each individual (self, parent or spouse) whose work
history is relevant to the determination of eligibility. In addition, the applicant shall provide a
release form signed by each such individual (copy attached) giving SSA permission to release
information on that individual to the state agency and/or the applicant. This form shall be
retained in the case file to document the individual's consent.

agreement between SSA and each state agency. In accordance with that revised agreement, and
within three months after the month in which the SSA verification system becomes operational,
the state agency will send the identifying information provided by the applicant to SSA for
overnight processing. In its response, SSA will provide information about qualifying quarters of
work. If the immigrant believes the information from SSA is inaccurate or incomplete, the State
agency shall refer the applicant to SSA for review. SSA will give the individual a document
indicating that the number of quarters is under review. An immigrant who provides the state
agency with this document can continue to receive benefits for six months from the date of SSA's
initial response or until SSA has completed its review, whichever is eariier.
