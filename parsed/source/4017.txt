TEXT:
I disagree with the first.   As to the second, we're not far away from an
almost certainly adverse decision on CDA, so we should definitely make
plans now.  Also, I think it seems kind of defensive, rather than positive
and affirmative to do it in that context, so I think it's fine that the
President said what he said.   But you needn't argue this with Gips.  All
you have to do is figure out where we're going from here.
