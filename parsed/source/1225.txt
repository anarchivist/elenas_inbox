Subject: Cloning

Please let me know what you want emphasized in the cloning remarks . . I am
assuming that we will be thanking the commission for their speedy
response, restating our position that creating a child through these
methods is morally and ethically wrong, announcing legislation.   What
about the embyo issue that the report (and legislation) is silent on?
Should the President express his own personal opposition to such
research?

Thanks.
