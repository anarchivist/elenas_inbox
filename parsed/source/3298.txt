1. Just a reminder that you should give me a quick substantive refresher course
so that I can call the HHS lawyers.
2. vicki Radd mentioned to me that you're looking into the question of
insurance coverage for battered women.· Vicky has asked me to figure out whether
the President can do anything with the ABA on the subject of battered women.
Would it help for me to know what you're up to?
