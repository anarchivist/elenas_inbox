        Policy Development

                One of the principal goals of the initiative is to identify the critical issues affecting race
        relations in this country and to propose governmental actions and policies addressing those
       ,issues. We believe we must articulate this goal forcefully from the outset, so as to prevent the
        media from portraying the initiative as simply a gabfest.

                In discussing policy initiatives, however, we must make two points clear. First, the
       Administration's policy will unfold over the whole course of the initiative. We will not lay down
       a full set of proposals in the San Diego speech or shortly thereafter; to the contrary, we will
       announce initiatives in stages throughout the year, with some of the larger ideas reserved for the
       President's Report to the American People. This approach will emphasize the way in which the
       Administration's policy is responding to the dialogue you have set in motion and the ideas
       arising from it.

               Second and even more important, the policy that the Administration intends to develop
       will not be a reprise of the Great Society. No one should expect massive new programs run by
       the federal government and involving the expenditureoflarge sums of money. Different times
       demand different kinds of solutions, in this area as in most others. We must make this point as
       strongly as possible to prevent commentators from contrasting, to our disadvantage, the size of
       our initiatives to earlier ones.

               The Domestic Policy Council, working in close coordination with the Executive Director
       of the Commission, will have primary responsibility for the development of policy. In general,
       the DPC wants both to develop wholly new policy initiatives and to refocus or better target
       existing Administration initiatives (~, the COPS and EZ programs) to address race-related
       issues. To accomplish these objectives, the DPC intends to establish interagency working
       groups, focused on particular issue areas, that will identify the most critical problems in each area
       and propose both administrative and legislative solutions to them. Although the DPC will not
       make any final decisions until we have named an Executive Director, the DPC currently intends
       to fonn groups on employment opportunity (with the NEC), education, housing, health, and the
       administration of justice (including both criminal justice and civil rights law).

               Some of the policies announced during the year will respond to issues arising (some of
       which we do not now even know about) as the Initiative moves forward. For example, one of the
       priority items for the DPC is to develop an action plan responding to the dramatic decreases in
       minority enrollment in the Texas and California higher education systems -- and the more general
       slowing of recent gains by minorities in college enrollment. Although work in this area has just
       begun, the interagency group is exploring whether and how to pressure or persuade colleges and
       universities to adopt new recruitment tools (including educational partnerships with certain
       schools) and/or facially race-neutral admission rules that effectively will achieve a racially
       diverse student body.

              Other policies announced during the year will attempt to address longstanding problems
       in new and creative ways -- ways that go beyond or reorient current polarized (and increasingly

                                                                                                       ds ~etnent System
                                                                                      Autoroated Rec<>t .
                                                                                      Hex-Dump ConversIon



      sterile) debates. For example, we might profitably reconceive the race issue in criminal justice as
      one that is -- not in whole, but in part -- about law enforcement authorities' failure to protect
      minority communities from criminality; and we might respond to this understanding by using the
      COPS program to increase police resources in underserved communities, expand the number of
      minority police officers serving those communities, and improve diversity training for all police
      officers. Similarly, we must recast the debate over educational opportunity within minority
      communities, as we already have started to do, by emphasizing the importance of creating
      national standards and then of providing students in these communities with the tools to meet
      them -- for example, by ensuring that these students get their fair share of the most experienced
      and qualified teachers through a combination of policies involving scholarships and loan
      forgiveness, enhanced training programs, and reforms in teacher licensing and certification.
