We're happy to help with the VP's remarks.  But he shouldn't undercut what
the President said yesterday. His message should be exactly the same as
the President's: The state settlement is a step forward.   But only the
national government and esp. the Congress can take the full range of steps
necessary to set a national poiicy on reducing youth smoking, such as
confirming the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products.  The last
Congress put partisanship ahead of progress. We'll make tobacco
legislation a top priority in the new Congress.

He can and should go to town attacking Congress. But it would be bad
faith, bad policy, and bad politics to pull the rug out from under Tom
Miller and a host of other AGs (most of them D's) who are signing onto
this deal because it's the best they can do without Congress.
