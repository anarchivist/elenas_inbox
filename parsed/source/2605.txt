    Supporting Working Families and Helping People Move from Welfare to Work

Welfare-to-Work Reauthorization: In 1997, the President insisted that the Balanced Budget
Act provide $1.5 billion a year in FY 1998 and FY 1999 for states and local communities to help
move long-term welfare recipients in high poverty areas into jobs and help them succeed in the
work force. In order to ensure the success of welfare reform for individuals who face the greatest
challenges, the President proposes to reauthorize the Welfare-to-Work program in FY 2000, with
several program modifications including a stronger focus on increasing the employment fathers
so they can better meet their responsibilities to their children. The President's budget will
include $1 billion for the Welfare-to-Work initiative in FY 2000, of which at least $150 million
will be dedicated to fathers who agree to work, pay child support, and become part of their
children's lives again. Remaining funds will go toward assisting long-term welfare recipients
with the greatest challenges to employment move into lasting jobs, including doubling the funds
available for Native American tribes.

Welfare-to-Work Transportation: A significant barrier facing people who move from welfare
to work, in both cities and rural areas, is finding transportation to get to jobs and employment-
related services. The President's leadership on this issue helped secure funding through FY 2003
for Job Access grants to assist states and localities in developing flexible transportation
alternatives, such as van services, for welfare recipients and other low income workers. The
President's budget doubles funding for this initiative, providing $150 million in FY 2000.

Welfare-to-Work Housing Vouchers: Last year's budget contained $283 million for 50,000
new housing vouchers for welfare recipients who need housing assistance to get or keep·a job.
Families will use these housing vouchers to move closer to a new job, to reduce a long commute,
or to secure more stable housing to eliminate emergencies that keep them from getting to work
every day on time. The FY 2000 budget proposes $144 million for an additional 25,000
vouchers, increasing the total number of welfare-to-work vouchers by 50 percent to 75,000 and
bringing total funding to $430 million.

Employer Tax Credits: The President's FY 2000 budget extends for one year the Welfare-to-
Work and Work Opportunity Tax Credits to encourage mo~e employers to hire welfare recipients
and other disadvantage individuals, at a cost of $528 million. Both credits are currently set to
expire on June 30, 1999. The Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit provides a credit equal to 35 percent
of the first $10,000 in wages for the first year of employment and 50 percent of the first $10,000
in wages in the second year to encourage the hiring and retention of long-term welfare recipients.
 The Work Opportunity Tax Credit provides a credit of up to $2,400 for the first year of wages
for eight groups of job seekers.

Child Support Enforcement: Since the President entered office, child support payments have
increased 80 percent to a record $14.4 billion in 1998. Not only are collections up, but the
number offamilies that are receiving child support has also increased. Last June, the President
signed legislation making certain egregious child support violations federal felonies. To ensure
that federal authorities have the resources available to prosecute under these statutes, the
Department of Health and Human Services will establish investigative teams in five regions of
the country to identify and investigate cases for prosecution. These sites will serve 17 states plus
D.C., which together have 63 percent of the nation's child support cases. Moreover, to ensure
U.S. Attorneys have the legal staff necessary to prosecute deadbeat parents, the budget includes
$34 million over five years, to fund an eightfold increase in the legal support staff dedicated to
                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion

Child Care: The President's budget proposes to expand the Child Care and Development Block
Grant to help working families struggling to meet the costs of child care. The President's
proposal: (1) increases funding for child care subsidies by $7.5 billion over five years, and these
new funds, combined with funds provided in welfare reform, will enable the program to serve an
additional 1.15 million children by FY 2004; (2) provides $3 billion over five years to promote
early learning; and (3) provides $173 million to improve child care quality. Additional funds for
subsidies are necessary because millions of families who are eligible for assistance with their
child care costs currently do not receive any help: in FY 1997, states provided child care
assistance to only 1.25 million of the 10 million low-income children eligible.

The President's budget also proposes to increase the Child Care and Dependent Care Tax Credit
which provides tax relief to taxpayers who pay for the care ofa child under 13 or a disabled
dependent or spouse in order to work. The President's proposal increases the credit for families
earning under $60,000, providing an additional average tax cut of $354 for these families and
eliminating income tax liability for almost all families with incomes below 200% of poverty
($35,000 for a family of four) that claim the maximum allowable child care expenses. The
budget includes $5 billion over five years to expand the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit
for nearly three million working families paying for child care. The President's budget also
proposes to enable parents who stay at home with children under one year old to take advantage
of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit by claiming assumed child care expenses of $500.
The President's budget proposal will provide an average tax credit of $178, at a cost of $1.3
billion over five years, which will benefit 1.7 million families. The President's plan also
includes a new tax credit to businesses that offer child care services to their employees.

Social Services Block Grant: The Budget proposes to fund the Social Services Block Grant
(SSBG) at its fully authorized level of$2.38 billion. SSBG provides funding to States to support
a wide range of programs including child protection and child welfare, child care, as well as
services focused on the needs of the elderly and disabled. The flexibility ofthis grant permits
States to target funds to meet the specific needs in their communities.

Individual Development Accounts: Since 1992, the President has supported the creation of
Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) to empower individuals to save for a first home, post-
secondary education, or to start a new business. Last year, the President signed into law
legislation creating a five-year $125 million demonstration program and the FY 1999 budget
included $10 million to launch this initiative. The President's budget provides $20 million for
IDAs in FY 2000.

Substance Abuse Treatment: SAMSHA's Targeted Capacity Expansion Grant program
provides funds to help communities address emerging substance abuse problems and unmet
treatment needs. National estimates show that approximately 20 percent of welfare recipients
have a substance abuse problem, and some states who have recently reviewed their welfare
caseloads have even higher estimates. Last year, one-third of these competitive grants focused
on substance abuse treatment for women with children, including those moving from welfare to
work. The President's FY 2000 budget proposes $110 million for Targeted Capacity Expansion
grants, which is double the FY 1999 level of$55 million and will provide treatment for another
21,000 individuals. The President's budget also funds the SAMSHA Block Grant at $1.615
billion, $30 million or 2 percent above the FY 1999 level.


                                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion
    Transitional Medical Assistance: Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) provides time-
    limited Medicaid coverage to low-income households whose earnings or child support would
    otherwise make them ineligible for Medicaid under state Medicaid income eligibility standards.
    The budget would eliminate some reporting requirements that are burdensome to states and to
    families, allowing States to check on TMA eligibility through regularly scheduled recertification
    procedures in the same manner that they otherwise assure ongoing eligibility in the Medicaid
    program. The budget would also encourage states to use existing options to expand Medicaid
    coverage to all low-income working families by relieving states ofTMA rules if they are
    otherwise providing coverage to low-income working families.

    TANF Contingency Fund: The 1996 welfare reform legislation established a Contingency Fund
    to assist States in meeting the need for welfare assistance during periods of economic downturn.
    The President's budget proposes replacing the current capped Contingency Fund with a new
    uncapped fund that could more effectively respond to state needs in the event of an unforeseen
    economic downturn.

    Restoring Benefits for Legal Immigrants: The Administration's budget continues to build on
    the progress of the last few years to restore important disability, health and nutrition benefits to
    legal immigrants, at a cost of $1.3 billion oveI: five years.

    ·      The budget restores eligibility for SSI and Medicaid to legal immigrants who enter the
           country after August 22, 1996 if they have been in the U.S. for five years and become
           disabled after entering the United States. This proposal costs approximately $930 million
           and assists an estimated 54,000 by 2004, about half of whom would be elderly.

    ·      The budget also allows elderly legal immigrants who were in the United States by August
           22, 1996 to be eligible for Food Stamps at a cost of$60 million. This provision makes an
           additional 15,000 legal immigrants eligible in 2004.

    ·      Finally, the President's budget allows states to provide health care benefits to legal
           immigrant children and pregnant women, who entered the United States after August 22,
           1996. Under this provision approximately 55,000 children could be served by FY 2004 at
           a cost of approximately $220 million and 23,000 pregnant women could be served at a
           cost of $1 05 million by FY 2004.

    English Literacy / Civics Initiative: The President's Budget contains an adult literacy initiative
    to help states and communities provide expanded access to high quality English language
    proficiency instruction, linked to practical instruction in civics and life skills including how to
    navigate the workplace, public education system, and other key institutions in American life.
    This initiative is designed both to help meet the extraordinary demand for English and civics
    instruction in immigrant communities and to demonstrate our shared commitment to fully
    integrate new Americans into our social and civic life. States, community-based organizations,
    local education agencies, and other non-profits will compete for grants to support English
    proficiency and civics instruction. With $70 million, the initiative will be able to provide
    English language and civics instruction to approximately 150,000 people in FY 2000. Overall,
    the President's FY 2000 budget contains a $190 million increase for adult education and family
    literacy.
                                                                                                     2/2/99

                                    Welfare-to-Work Reauthorization

                                             January 28,1999

Background

As part of the Administration's overall welfare reform efforts, the President insisted that the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 provide $1.5 billion a year in FY 1998 and FY 1999 for states and local communities to
help move long-term welfare recipients in high poverty areas into jobs and help them succeed in the work
force. This program is particularly important because even though welfare caseloads are at their lowest level
in 30 years, the individuals remaining on the welfare rolls face particular challenges. The Welfare-to-Work
program funds job creation, job placement and job retention efforts such as wage subsidies and other critical
post-employment support services. The program targets welfare recipients with the greatest challenges to
employment -- long term recipients with poor work histories, low basic skills, or substance abuse problems.
The program also serves noncustodial parents with barriers to employment whose children are long term
welfare recipients.

To ensure the success of welfare reform for individuals who face the greatest challenges, President Clinton
proposes to reauthorize the Welfare-to-Work program in FY 2000, with several program modifications
including a stronger focus on increasing the employment of low income fathers so they can better meet their
responsibilities to their children. The President's budget will include $1 billion for the Welfare-to-Work
initiative in FY 2000.

Progress to Date

Currently, about 75 percent of the Welfare-to-Work funds an; allocated to states on a formula basis, which in
tum must pass 85 percent of these funds to local Private Industry Councils or Workforce Boards. The
remaining 25 percent ofthe funds are awarded on a competitive basis by the Department of Labor to support
innovative welfare to work projects at a variety of private and public organizations.

In FY 1998, 44 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands received
Department of Labor Welfare-to-Work Formula Grants totaling more than $1 billion. Each applying State
was willing to meet the requirement to match each $2 offederal investment with $1 of non-federal funds.
The match provided by the States reflects approximately $500 million in leveraged dollars. States have three
years to spend these resources serving the most-difficult to employ TANF recipients.

In addition, one percent of the WTW funds are reserved for Indian tribes. Eighty-six tribes received grants
totaling $12.3 million.

In 1998, the Department of Labor held two competitions for innovative local grants. The demand far
outstripped resources available. Approximately 1,400 applications were received requesting approximately
$5 billion. Approximately $368 million has been awarded to 126 grantees in local communities throughout
the country. In January 1999, the Department released a Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA) for the
third round of competitive grants that will be awarded later in the calendar year, with high priority for
applications which focus on non-custodial parents or long-term welfare recipients with limited English
proficiency, disabilities, substance abuse problems, or a history of domestic violence.

                                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion

After a year of program implementation and consultations with program operators and service providers at
the state and local levels, we have come to the conclusion that we must modify key aspects of the program to
serve those most in need.

       Continue to Concentrate on the Hardest to Serve. The Department of Labor is proposing to retain
       the program's strong focus on those most in need while simplifying the criteria to ensure that those
       long-term recipients most in need can be served. Pursuant to the reauthorization proposal, the hardest
       to employ will be defined as long-term welfare recipients who have one of the following
       characteristics: lacks a high school diploma or GED; or is deficient in basic skills including limited
       English proficiency; or requires substance abuse treatment; or is homeless; or has a poor work
       history; or has a disability.

      Focus on Fathers. We know that in order for welfare reform to be a success, it is important to focus
      on the whole family. It is critically important that both parents contribute to the support of their
      children. While every father has a moral obligation to support their children, some need help getting a
      job and succeeding in the workforce to do so. Already, many states are using some oftheir Welfare-
      to-Work funds to help fathers of children on welfare get jobs. Now, we propose to ensure every state
      help committed fathers fulfill their obligations to their children. Under this proposal, states and
      communities will provide job placement and job retention assistance to low income fathers who sign
      personal responsibility contracts committing them to work and pay child support. States shall commit
      at least 20 percent of their formula funds (about $150 million a year) to helping low income fathers
      get and keep jobs and ensuring they support their families.

      Increase Resources to Indians and Native Americans. The original formula used to allocate funds
      to Native American tribes did not provide adequate resources to meet the challenges that Native
      Americans on welfare face. The Department of Labor plans to double the funding available to Native
      American tribes. Additionally, tribes will be able to apply for Welfare to Work competitive funds
      independent of other entities.

      Integrate the Welfare to Work Program with Workforce Legis/ation. Over the past year, we learned
      that the WtW program presents an unprecedented opportunity for coordination and cooperation
      between the workforce system and the welfare system at the state and local levels. To further those
      efforts, a State's Welfare-to-Work plan would become a part of a Governors' larger scale 5-year State
      Workforce Development plan called for by the newly enacted Workforce Investment Act (WIA).
      WIA designates every locally run Welfare-to-Work grantee as a mandatory partner in every One-Stop
      Career Center throughout the nation, allowing for an even wider range of possible services,
      economies of scale, and a variety of shareable resources. Congress has given local, business-led
      workforce investment boards responsibility for strategic planning, policy and oversight of the
      workforce investment system and for similar functions to help hard to employ T ANF recipients get
      jobs and progress toward self-sufficiency under the WtW program.

      Extend the Work Opportunity and Welfare to Work Tax Credits. The President is proposing to
      extend for one year the Welfare to Work and Work Opportunity Tax Credits to encourage more
      employers to hire welfare recipients and other disadvantage individuals.
