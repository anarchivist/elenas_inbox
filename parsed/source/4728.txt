TEXT:
The SSI issue didn't come up at 7:30. Mary Ellen Glynn asked me about it
at 8:15.  She agrees that we shouldn't do it next week, and would prefer
that we not do it this week either.  She said she would talk to Mike about
it.

Otherwise:
1. Don Baer said the policy shops have to give him paper soon on the SOTU
   both overall "vision" and specific suggestions.

2. OMB is continuing public release of the DC plan.           There's a package of
materials I'll try to get for both of this morning.

3. The campaign finance meeting Hilley wanted (with the reform groups and
President) won't happen this week.  There's going to be a formal,
Presidential-level announcement of the DNC leaders this week. Rahm wants
to release info on DNC reforms at the same time.  Some people doubted
whether the reform plan would be ready in time.  Leon pressed for an
expedition.

4. Gene's education event is set to roll for Thursday.           (Why exactly is
this GENE's education event?)

5. Rahm asked that we (I say "we," but it was unclear to whom he was
talking) figure out whether or how to plug into state efforts to pass HMO
Patients' Bills of Rights.  (See the Washington Post this morning.).

6. All agreed that Mike should comment as little as possible on the Pear
story and the details of the Administration's Medicaid proposals. To the
extent he needs to say something, he should state the two overarching
principles: (1) retaining the individual guarantee and (2) placing
constraints on overall spending.
