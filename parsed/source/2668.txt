Subject:         states and tobacco

Was speaking to Ken Salazar, AG for Colorado, who asked about President's
comments to governors as to what states could spend money.  his point is
that the new republican governor is saying that clinton said solong as
money is spent on kids, he's okay and so governor wants to spend on
capital improvments for schools, education, etc. Will one of you please
fax him whatever the President said on tobacco at NGA and/or our most
recent iteration of our position on how states should spend their
money- -number isI   P6/(b)(6)  I
