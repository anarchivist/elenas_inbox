Subject:         NBAC Letter

I have a copy of NBAC' s letter to the Presid·ent. I think he should
probably see it and have it explained.

Therefore, might I suggest that you do a joint DPC/OSTP'short cover note
to go on top of the letter.  Could I get maybe get it by the end of the
day? Thanks.

If you think this is not the way to go, let me know.
