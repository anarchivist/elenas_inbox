I am doing talking points for PIR, which include this paragraph. Is there
a $ figure for this program now? Can we use it? Or are you saving for
re-announcement?

Thanks.

Creating "Education Opportunity Zones." On December 3, 1997, at President
ClintonD,s first Race Town Meeting, President Clinton announced a
competitive challenge grants program aimed at demonstrating comprehensive,
coordinated and effective approaches to expanding opportunities for
students in high-poverty urban and rural school districts.  These grants
are coupled with a balanced approach to· increased responsibility for
results for schools, educators and students themselves.  High-poverty
school districts will be eligible for additional Federal funding if (1)
they adopt tough reform measures -- like those adopted in Chicago -- that
make administrators, principals, teachers and students truly accountable
for success or failure, and (2) in time, show real improvements in student
achievement.
