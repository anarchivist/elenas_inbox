Comments on US Conference of Mayors resolution on welfare reform:

Overall: The resolution agrees with our goal of reforming welfare with an
emphasis on work, and supports many of our specific policies, such as
creating a $3 billion welfare to work program, enacting a targeted
welfare-to-work tax credit, and restoring benefit's to legal immigrants.
It also voices concerns about the end of the entitlement to assistance,
the level of budget cuts in the welfare law, and whether there will be
enough jobs for welfare recipients in many cities.   It goes beyond the
policy in the PresidentD,s budget by supporting restoration of food stamp
benefits for legal immigrants (we restored SSI and Medicaid, but not food
stamps) and including SSI for non-disabled elderly legal immigrants, as
well as the disabled.

possible suggestions for improvements:

1. Drop Item 2, which is an unnecessarily negative description of the
welfare law. They will probably resist.

2. We could ask them to drop references to improvements we were not able
to secure in the budget agreement -- but it is not critical, and they will
rightfully protest, so I would not recommend asking. These items are:
restore food stamps to legal immigrants; restore SSI to elderly
non-disabled legal immigrants; restore food stamps to childless adults who
canD,t find work; repeal other food stamp cuts (i.e., shelter deduction,
standard deduction, vehicle asset limit) .
