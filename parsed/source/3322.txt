TEXT:
I just talked with Kathy Russell . . She and Debra Cohn will speak to some people
from the criminal Division this afternoon and get back to me around 4:00 or 5:00
as to what they feel comfortable doing.    I think it will be OK, but as of now I
make no guarantees.
One thing Kathy said makes sense to me -- and I suspect it will to you too.    She
noted (as you did) that the number of federal prosecutions brought is very low.
Because of this, she wants to make sure that we not overstate our case as to
past accomplishments -- and indeed that we couch our discussion in terms of how
much is yet to be done.
