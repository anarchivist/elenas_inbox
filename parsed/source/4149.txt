Subject:         Immigration Questions

I received a call from a newspaper in Los Angeles who is looking for our
position on Food Stamps and Welfare. As you know, a large number of
immigrants will losse food stamp eligibility come Sept. 1 Are we
supporting any congressional bills that would restore funds? Do you have
any guidance I can use to answer questions?  (Someone mentioned possible
guidance to be faxed to Barry Toiv earlier this week)

In the next week, I expect many more calls will come in asking about the
topic. What is our line? Are we still evaluating spending bills?    .. who
can I talk to?

.... I'm the new Specialty Press contact.
