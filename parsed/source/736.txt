Subject:         Stenholm's guy

Stenholm's guy Ed Lorenzen left me a message telling me where Lt Gov.
Bullock is on privatization. He said Bullock is still very much in favor
of letting the state go the next step of issuing the RFO, but that that
shouldn't obligate anyone to finally let a contract.  I was surprised how
much he stressed the notion that it remain an active option for the state
to do no contract at all, after it examines bids.

Emily, he also said that we should make sure that Bullock is notified by
us rather than the Governor.  I will reinforce with Monahan.

Monahan also left me a message saying he needs our comments because HHS
needs to get back to state tomorrow -- but I thought it was Monday or
Tuesday .... I will ask him why he said tomorrow.

 Message Creation Date was at 18-MAR-1997 10:22:00

   Here is the letter.   Elena, Jon Kaplan can work with you and the Vice
   President's office on the release.   Here is what has changed since the
   last
   time it. was circulated.  I leave it to your discretion and Jon's as to
   whether
 . anyone needs. to have a final poke at the letter in view of the changes and
   the
   passage of time.

 1. I eliminated a sentence saying that if the FCC finds a link between
 the ads
 and children's attitudes about liquor that the FCC should consider time
 restrictions on the advertising.  Dan Tate thought that was too strong.
 We
 don't really need to say it, so I struck it.  I alerted Rahm to this
 change,
 but don't know if he focused on it at the time.  I don't know whether this
 would be viewed by others as subtracting from the oomph of what we're
 doing,
 but I think the change Dan suggested is an improvement.

 2. Kahlua is supposedly on the brink of a big advertising campaign.   I
 don't
 know whether what they are planning, which may have ~ strong subliminal
 appeal
 to children that is obvious to adults, may tip the balance at the FCC and
 cause
 them to act regardless of whatever we say or don't say.

 3. Interest in this issue seems to have quieted on the Hill.         I can't
 tell
 whether this is an enduring or temporary phenomenon.

 The previous version was circulated to Podesta, Echaveste, Hilley, Klain,
 Sperling, Reed, Ruff, Simon and Kalil.

Chairman, Federal Communications Commission
1919 M Street, NW., Suite 814
Washington, D.C. 20554

Dear Chairman Hundt:

        I write to ask your assistance in addressing a new and emerging challenge to parents
struggling to raise safe, healthy children: the decision by manufacturers of hard liquor to advertise
on television.

         For half a century, these companies voluntarily refrained from such advertising. They
understood that advertising over the uniquely powerful and pervasive medium of broadcasting
could reach children inappropriately, encouraging them to drink before it is even legal for them
to do so. Until now, these companies have shown appropriate restraint. For as long as there has
been television, they have known that a voluntary ban was right and they lived by it.
         Now, some companies have broken ranks and started placing hard liquor ads on TV. I
was greatly disappointed by their decision. I have previously expressed my dismay at this action
and called on the industry to urge all its members to return to their long-standing policy and
stand by the ban. I am gratified to learn that, according to one survey, the vast majority of
television stations are declining to air these advertisements. I applaud that stand.

       I firmly believe that we have a national obligation to act strongly to protect our children
from threats to their health and safety. That's why I have fought so strongly to impose
appropriate regulations on the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and
tobacco advertising that appeals to adolescents, to ensure that our schools and children are safe
and drug-free, and to combat gangs and violence afflicting our youth.

        I applaud your public remarks calling on the industry and broadcasters to reactivate the
voluntary ban. I also commend your comments that the Federal Communications Commission
has an obligation to consider any and all actions that would protect the public interest in the use
of the public airwaves.

         I urge the Commission to take all appropriate actions to explore what effects might ensue
in light of the decision by manufacturers of hard liquor to abandon their long-standing voluntary
ban on television advertising, specifically the impact on underage drinking.

       We have made tremendous progress in recent years reducing the incidence of deaths due
to drunk driving among our youth. We have taken important steps including the increase in the
1980s in the drinking age to 21 and the passage of zero tolerance legislation for underage



                                                                Automated Records Management System
                                                                Hex-Dump Conversion
in car crashes, and too many young people are starting to drink at an early age, leading to
alcohol and other substance abuse problems.

        I would appreciate your help and the help of the Commission in exploring the possible
actions you could take to support our parents and children in response to the manufacturers'
decision to break with the long and honorable tradition of not advertising on the broadcast
medium.

       Sincerely,




                                                        Automated Records Management System
                                                        Hex-Dump Conversion
