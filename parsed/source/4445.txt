TEXT:
In a meeting yesterday, the President specifically brought up Chicago and
said that the best thing that could happen to k-12 education was for every
school district to do what chicago had done.   I suspect that the President
will· say something like this regardless whether we put it into the speech
(so taking it out would be a false savings). But even if that's not
right, I'd argue for keeping it in because the President really does
believe that this is the approach most likely to lead to racial equality.
