Subject:         Food Stamp Waiver

Tom Barrett, D, wisc wrote to John about a pending food stamp waiver by
the state of wisconsin to privatize the system -- I think this has been
pending for a while.  Barrett is very concerned about the impact of
priviatization.  I tried to follow-up w/ the USDA but was unable to locate
the right person -- would you either tell me who I should call -~ or if
easier let me know the status --- thanks.    appreciate your help
