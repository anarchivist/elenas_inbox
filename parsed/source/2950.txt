Subject:         responses to letters on racial profiling

Spoke to wade henderson today on a number of topics. He raised with me
that we have not yet responded to lccr's or price's letter on racial
profiling and that they're getting a little perturbed--what's our
plan--there should be a written response. remember we wrote an interim
respnse. Also--he hoped the president would show leadership tomorrow,
talked about an executive order and he urged strong language and if we
couldn't do an outright ban because of ins/customs, he definitely thought
we needed executive action tomorrow--president can't just go and
talk--I'll make sure the president knows this if he's unwilling to make a
decision.
