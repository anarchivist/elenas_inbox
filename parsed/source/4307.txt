 What do you think our next step should be?   (You have to love these
 groups--they always seem to find a way to lay fault at the White House and
 focus solely on the dc game and not in building public support out there
 in the country.)  Audrey--who all did you meet with?

 Subject:         Child Care


 Yesterday we had our internal meeting with the key "thinkers and movers"
 on the child care initiative.  Following is the summary:

 1. Clearly Children's Defense Fund is the lead organization and they don't
 believe any other coalition/campaign is needed ..... they are the
 coalition/campaign.

 2. When asked how we could assist with outreach, the only group they
 don't feel is connected is business.

 3.   They want the White House to use events/opportunities to continue and
 keep child care on the front of the agenda.

 4.   The bottom line for them is "what is our legislative strategy?" They
 had some thoughts, but really said the most confusion on this issue from
 WH is within the absence of a legislative strategy, with or without a bill
 although they much prefer a bill.

 suggestion: We need to convene an internal meeting with DPC and leg
 affairs and whoever else to discuss legislative strategy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

 As an FYI, Maureen and Doris were at the meeting as well .... if either of
 you have something to add, feel free! ,
