TEXT:
That's fine.  The only point I intended to make is that when we communicate this
message (and I take it we're doing it orally (??), so I wouldn't get obsessed on
exact language), we shouldn't say that the states are in any way ,legally
prevented from operating under these waivers, because they're not.
