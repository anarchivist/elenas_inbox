After your meeting Friday before last, Mary Beth Donahue (Deputy COS)
decided
this had to be run out of the Secretary's office, ordered Jerrry NOT to
talk to
rest of HHS about it, and assigned the issue to a staff person at HHS
"exec
sec." Mary Beth promised a memo by tomorrow (thought that Corr had let
you
know last week they couldn't meet original deadline).

I am doing what I can w/out HHS.  Jerry is following up with a police
organization Dennis Burke put us in touch with, and I am trading phone
calls
with NHTSA.  I'll have time to move the ball forward this week.
