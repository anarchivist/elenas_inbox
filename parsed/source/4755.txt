Would you let them know that DPC doesn't have any substantive comments,

but

that the question of when the report will be released (i.e., whether it

should

be released at the brain conf on the 17th) is still an open one?     thanks.

         OSTP is planning to release the kids research report April 17 at an

         II   event , "

         per a voice mail they left for me so is urgently trying to get DPC

         clearance.

         Note that the report gives DPC a specific role in research planning --

         other

         than noting that, I haven't reviewed it either.
