Subject: IL Senate backs anti-gay partner measure

        SPRINGFIELD, Ill., March 18 (UPI) -- The Illinois Sen~te supported
a measure requiring municipalities that try to extend government employee
health benefits to the domestic partners of homosexual city employees to
provide them to the unmarried partners of heterosexual employees as well.

        By a 40-10 vote, the Senate Tuesday gave final approval to a
measure by state Sen. Walter Dudycz, R-Chicago, requiring all unmarried
partners to get full benefits.

        Dudycz' measure was inspired because Chicago city government is
considering a measure extending the benefits to the gay partners of city
employees. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley backs the measure.

        But Dudycz does not. On Tuesday, he told his Senate colleagues he
thinks it is illegal to provide medical benefits to only some unmarried
partners of city employees.

        privately, Dudycz admits his measure is a reaction to Chicago city
government, claiming he thinks their action -- which has yet to be voted
on by the full City Council -- "undermines the sanctity of marriage."

        Daley has said he opposes the state's action, saying that it would
cost the city too much money to provide full benefits to all unmarried


          partners, although city officials cannot offer a specific dollar amount.

                 The measure, which now goes to the Illinois House where it faces
          an uncertain future, also is opposed by the American civil Liberties
          Union.
