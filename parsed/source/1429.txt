TEXT:
1.  I just looked over Eli's most recent memo to you.  It looks great.
I'd try to convince him, though, to combine the St. Louis event with the
announcements on (a) 1,000 companies and (b) partnerships in other
cities. There are only so many times in August that the Welfare-to-Work
Partnership can expect to make the news.

2. Cynthia and Diana have modified their original views on whether the
new minimum .wage provision weakens work requirements between 20 and 30
hours.   You recall that they initially told us that the new provision
allows low-wage states like Mississippi to count below 20 hours the same
activities that any state can count under the current law between 20 and
30 hours. But it seems as if that's not really right.    While the welfare
law allows states to count education and training directly related to
employment in the gap between 20 and 30 hours, the law does NOT make it
easier for states to count job search and voc ed in this gap. So the new
minimum wage provision, which allows states to count ALL of these
activities once the employee has worked off her benefit package, WILL give
almost every state (low-wage or high-wage) new flexibility to resort to
job search, etc. and still meet the work requirements.

3. I'm sending you materials from DOL on alternatives to the current FLSA
provision in the budget bill.  We had a meeting with them on Thursday
which was quite useful.  Give the materials a quick once-over when you
have a chance and/or ask me to brief you.
