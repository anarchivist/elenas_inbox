TEXT:
1. How many people are now on the rolls?

2.   What percentage is that of the population?

3. When we say that Wisconsin has put 23m and wisconsin 160m in new funds
into child care, is that this year?

4.   What are examples of states that have seamless child care systems?

5. What was the rate of child support collection in 1992? now (or in
1996)? Can we get state-by-state breakdowns on child support?

6. Have any states actually diverted funds?       If I want to name a "bad"
state -- and say why -- which should it be?

7. Are there any interesting graphics -- a map, a chart, etc.       -- we can,
should offer?

8.   What's the year (1994??) that TANF funds are pegged to?

Many, many thanks.
