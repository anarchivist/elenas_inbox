        The Administration has always supported federal legislation that explicitly affinns the
FDA's authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Under
this legislation, the FDA's jurisdiction over tobacco products must be as great as its authority
over other drugs and devices. The FDA must be able to regulate these products -- including by
mandating companies to reduce or eliminate nicotine or other constituents -- based on a thorough
and reasoned assessment, of the kind required for regulation generally, that doing so will reduce
the risk of the product to the pUblic. The legislation should not impose any obligation on the
FDA to make specific findings about such speculative matters as the creation of contraband
markets. Neither should the legislation impose any special procedural hurdles or requirements,
such as enhanced standards of proof or unusual evidentiary formalities, on the FDA's regulation
of tobacco products.


Changing the Way The Industry Does Business

        Federal tobacco legislation must include measures to expose the industry's past
misconduct, especially efforts to market products to children, and to change the way the industry
does business. Voluntary commitments on the part of the industry -- such Cis agreements to limit
advertising to children -- can indicate increased corporate responsibility. But legislation is
needed to ensure that patterns of corporate malfeasance are disclosed and effectively checked in
the future.

        To this end, legislation must provide for broad disclosure of industry documents,
especially those containing scientific or other health infonnation or relating to the industry's
attempts to market tobacco to children. This legislation should comport with essential principles
of attorney-client privilege. But the legislation should establish effective mechanisms to tum
over to the public all non-privileged documents (including documents the industry has falsely
claimed to be privileged), as well as to disclose all scientific and health-related information in
even privileged documents.

        Legislation also must require tobacco companies to set up comprehensive corporate
compliance programs that will reinforce the real economic incentives provided by the youth
smoking penalties (see above) to discourage companies from marketing to children. Further, the
legislation should establish oversight mechanisms to investigate and monitor corporate
compliance and to make recommendations to Congress on appropriate future legislation.


Meeting Other Public Health Goals

        Federal tobacco legislation provides an opportunity not only to reduce youth smoking, but
to meet other public health goals: the reduction of environmental (i.e., second-hand) tobacco
smoke, the expansion of smoking cessation programs, the strengthening of international efforts to
control tobacco, and the provision of funds for medical research and other health objectives ..



                                                               Automated Records Management System
                                                               Hex-Dump Conversion




                 Federal tobacco legislation should include provisions to restrict smoking in workplaces
         and other public facilities of the kind found in H.R. 3434, as well as in the President's recent
         Executive Order on tobacco smoke in federal facilities. The best scientific studies show that this
         measure would reduce the risk of death and injury to non-smokers, including hundreds of
         thousands of children with asthma and other respiratory illness, and would lead many smokers to
         quit the habit.

                Legislation also should provide sufficient funds to enable smoking cessation programs
         and services to reach and assist the millions of smokers who want to break their addiction to
         tobacco products. Data suggests that some 70% of smokers want to quit, but less than 25% now
         successfully do so.

                  Legislation should strengthen the Administration's leadership role in' global and bilateral
         efforts to reduce smoking by providing assistance to international organizations such as the
         World Health Organization. According to the WHO, tobacco use now causes 3 million deaths a
         year worldwide; unless checked, that number will rise to 10 million by 2025, with 75% of annual
         deaths occurring in developing countries.

                Finally, legislation should generate enough additional resources to establish a medical.
         research fund and further other important health objectives. The Administration believes that
         tobacco legislation should be viewed primarily not as a means of raising money, but of
         improving the public -- and especially our children's -- health. Nonetheless, tobacco legislation
         should take into account the costs that the industry has wreaked on society. In particular, the
         amount of money payable to the public cannot be decreased by the amount of the excise tax
         imposed in the balanced budget.


         Next Steps

                 The Administration wishes to pursue legislation along these lines in a cooperative and
         bipartisan manner, and to work with dispatch toward a comprehensive industry-wide solution.
         The President will soon invite leaders and other key members of both parties to the White House
         to communicate his approach to tobacco legislation and to launch this bipartisan process.




                                                                    Automated Records Management System
                                                                    Hex-Dump Conversion
