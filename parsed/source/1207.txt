      President Clinton's Petition To The Federal Election Commission To
                                Ban "Soft Money"
                                           June 5, 1997


        Today, the President petitioned the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to revisit its rules
on "soft money" and act to ban the use of "soft money" in federal elections, as proposed in
bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation now before Congress. The petition proposes to
end the current "soft money" system by requiring that candidates for federal office and national
parties be permitted to raise and spend only "hard money" -- funds subject to the restrictions,
contribution limits, and reporting requirements of the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA). This ban would apply to all political party committees, as anticipated by the bipartisan
campaign finance reform legislation.


"Soft money" and federal elections

        "Soft money" plays an increasingly large role in funding political parties and campaigns.
So-called "hard money" contributions are those that are given to candidates or parties subject to
the limits and disclosure of federal law. "Soft moneY,"on the other hand, goes to national or state
political parties, and can be raised in large amounts and from sources (such as corporations and
unions).

       The role of "soft money" has grown dramatically in the past several elections. In 1996,
the Democratic Party raised $123 million, and the Republican Party raised $138 million in "soft
money" -- more than triple the total of four years before.

        "Soft money" is today lawful under a series of Federal Election Commission (FEC)
regulations. The FEe first issued advisory opinions on this in 1978. It did not take further action
during the 1980's, as the role of "soft money"grew. In 1990, ordered to take some action on "soft
money" by a federal court, the FEC promulgated regulations that govern how parties can allocate
funds between federal and non-federal activities. (The court deferred to the agency as to may to
address the issue, but noted that the agency could go as far as to ban the use of soft money for
mixed federal- and state-political activity.)

      In addition, the 1979 statutory amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act
(FECA) authorized allocation of national and state "hard money" for joint activities.

President Clinton's support for a "soft money" ban

      President Clinton has consistently called for legislation that would ban the use of "soft
money" in federal elections. He called for this legislation during the 1992 campaign, and


                                                          Automated Records Management System
                                                          Hex-Dump Conversion
would have banned "soft money." The campaign finance reform plan he proposed in May 1993
included a "soft money" ban; this proposal was passed by both chambers but was killed by a
Senate filibuster in 1994.

        The bipartisan campaign finance refonn legislation introduced by Senators McCain and
Feingold and Representatives Shays and Meehan would prohibit the use of "soft money" in
federal elections.

       In January, 1993, the Democratic National Committee voluntarily announced that it
would restrict contributions it can currently accept under the law. It would not accept "soft
money" contributions in excess of $1 00,000 per year, and it would not accept contributions from
individuals who are not citizens or from domestic subsidiaries of foreign corporations.

Contents of the request to the FEC

        The President continues to call on Congress to enact the bipartisan legislation to reform
campaign financing and ban "soft money." In the meantime, he is fonnally requesting the FEC
to act now, under existing law, to write new regulations banning the use of "soft money" to
influence federal elections, as .envisioned in the legislation. Specifically, the President is
requesting that the Commission consider new rulemaking to accomplish the following:

·      Prohibit national political parties (and their congressional campaign committees or agents)
       from soliciting or receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of
       FECA. (This action would preclude, for example, contributions directly from corporate
       or union treasuries, or contributions from individuals in excess of the amount an
       individual can give to a national party's federal account.)

·      Prohibit any federal officeholder or candidate (and his or her agents) from soliciting or
       receiving any funds not subject to the limitations or prohibitions of FECA. (This action
       would preclude the same kind of contributions.)

·      Provide that any expenditure by any national, state, or local political party during a federal
       election year for any activity that influences a federal election (including any voter
       registration or get-out-the-vote drive, generic advertising, or any communication that
       refers to a federal candidate) must be paid for from funds subject to FECA. (This would
       end the allocation system, currently authorized by the FEC, under which "hard" and
       "soft" money are mixed for campaign activities that affect both state and federal elections.)
