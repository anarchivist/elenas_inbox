TEXT:
The bottom line is that both OLC and I would feel perfectly comfortable
defending the constitutionality of your franking proposal. There are a couple
of litigation risks, and there may be ways to frame the proposal so as to
minimize those risks.  Give me a call when you have time, and we'll discuss.
