Elena, I think you know all of this anyway, but here's what I know.  The
agreement is to spend $2.5 billion on benefit restorations to legal
immigrants.    The initial list was:
(1) food stamps for legal immigrant families with children, regardless of
date of entry;
(2) food stamps for refugees and asylees for 7 years instead.of 5;
(3) Medicaid/CHIP for children who entered the country after the law was
signed; and
(4) food stamps for the Hmong (a compelling group who fought in the
Vietnam War) .

Most of the cost ($2 billion)      is the first item.

However, immigration advocates that OMB consulted objected strenuously
particularly Greenstein.  They were delighted with the size of the
package, but felt we were making a big tactical mistake by leaving out the
disabled and elderly (who cost $400 million). Our rationale for doing so
was that they already benefitted from the major SSI/Medicaid restorations
enacted this summer, so it's time to help a new group.  Greenstein's
response is that (1) the disabled/elderly are the Ag Committee's top
priority and, if we don't propose this restoration, Congress will have an
excuse to ignore this issue altogether; (2) we are spending a lot of money
on prospective restorations for families with children that are unlikely
to be enacted; and (3) the disabled/elderly are compelling enough that
leaving them out entirely leaves us vulnerable as debate on this proceeds.

OMB's solution is a partial restoration for the disabled/elderly -- the
non-disabled elderly over 75, and the disabled.  This is paid for by
deeming sponsor income for those with affidavits of support, plus some
other money OMB dug up.
