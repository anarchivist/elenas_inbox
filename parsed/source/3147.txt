I just gave Jennifer O'Connor a rundown on the continuing Forest Service/DOJ
confusion on pre-1990 sales.   (By the by, she pointed out to me that the Forest
Service previously has said there are 153 mbf of unreported 1990 sales.   Is this
the same 153 mbf as was reported to us as 1986-89 sales?)   She told me that she
had asked Shelley for an update (for Leon and Harold) on all the numbers --
basically, an expanded and updated version of TJ's document.   Would you make
sure whoever's doing that memo is aware of the continuing uncertainty as to this
category of sales? Thanks.
