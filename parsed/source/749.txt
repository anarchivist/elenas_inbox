                                                  March 31,1997

         MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF

         FROM:                    BRUCE REED
                                  ELENA KAGAN

         SUBJECT:                 IDEAS

         Health and Safety

         1. Children's Health EO: The DPC and other White House offices are working on an executive
         order designed to ensure that the federal government considers the special needs of children
         when taking regulatory action. The executive order requires every agency to determine whether a
         regulation may impose disproportionate risks on children and, if so, to evaluate the specific
         effects of the regulation on children. Several agencies have raised last-minute objections, but we
         are hoping that we can work these out in the next few weeks, in time for the Conference on Early
         Childhood Development.                               .

         2. Medical Privacy: We are working with HHS on a bill relating to the disclosure and use of
         genetic screening information. This idea is both good and timely, and we may be ready to make
         an announcement within the month. We also are working with HHS to develop a broader piece
         of legislation ensuring appropriate privacy protections for all medical records. This proposal is
         proving extremely complex, and it will probably take several months to work out all the issues.

         3. Rural Health Regulations: HHS will issue much-needed regulations focusing on rural health
         care within the next few months. We can use these regulations as the core of an event focusing
         on the special health needs of rural communities.

         4. Business Endorsement of Kids' Coverage: We can put together an event, for as early as this
         month, at which important rep'resentatives of the business community endorse our proposal to
         extend health care coverage for children.

         5. Executive Order on Unemployed Workers: We are exploring whether we have legal
         authority to issue an executive order granting six months of health care coverage to unemployed
         federal workers (thus mirroring our budget proposal). We should know within a week or so
         whether this action is doable.

         6. Tobacco Advertising: We are reviewing ideas for the President to take action responding to
         tobacco companies' use of the internet and other fora to get around our tobacco regulation. We
         might want to focus on this issue on "Kick Butts" day. We are also working on a response in


                                                                 Automated Records Management System
                                                                 Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                        2

      case the federal judge in North Carolina rules against our tobacco regulation. That ruling is
      expected within the next week or so. One possibility is to bring suit against the tobacco
      companies for Medicare costs, but HHS earlier decided not to take this route and is probably still
      against it.

      7. Seat Belt Use: The Department of Transportation is ready to give the President a report on
      ways to increase seat belt use. DOT's report will set new national goals for seat belt use and will
      include ideas for presidential challenges to states and business groups to advance those goals. At
      the same time, the President can announce that we are submitting legislation requiring states to
      implement primary seatbelt laws or divert 1% of their highway funds to safety uses. He also can
      update an out-of-date Executive Order relating to seatbelt use on federal lands and by federal
      employees. We can announce these actions just after the President meets with Big 3 automobile
      executives, at an event that also includes safety advocates.

      8. Aggressive drivers/driver emergency number: DOT is working on a package of proposals
      to deal with aggressive drivers; we expect to get the package within 10 days. But DOT thinks the
      package will seem skimpy and that it may provoke safety advocates to say that the real problem
      is the speed limit. DOT has suggested as an alternative action creating a uniform emergency
      number for cellular phones. DOT thinks such an action can be ready by May. Weare continuing
      to work on these ideas.

      9. Conquering Disease: We are working with our scientists on steps the President could take to
      advance the search for an AIDS vaccine. We are also working with them on the possibility of an
      initiative to combat emerging infections like ebola and malaria around the world, or an initiative
      to combat diabetes. No one knows it, but our budget includes $20 million for the World Health
      Organization and other groups like Rotary International to wipe out smallpox worldwide.

      Education

      1. "California in the White House" Educatio.n Event. We are preparing for a major
      endorsement of the President's national testing initiative on Wednesday, April 2. At a roundtable
      discussion, Delaine Eastin, California Superintendent of Schools, will announce that California
      will participate in the initiative. This commitment, when added to those from Maryland,
      Michigan, and North Carolina, means that about 20 percent ofthe nation's 4th and 8th grade
      students will take our tests. In addition, John Doerr, managing partner of the venture capital firm
      Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, will announce that more than 100 high-tech CEOs are
      endorsing the testing initiative and will urge every governor and state education official to sign
      on to the tests.

      2. Advisory Panel for Education Tests: The Education Department is thinking about the
      appropriate structure and composition of a panel of teachers and other trusted educators to advise
      on the development of our 4th and 8th grade tests. (The Department may decide to use an
      existing, non-governmental group to perform this advisory function -- or, alternatively, to assume



                                                             Automated Records Management System
                                                             Hex-Dump Conversion

complete responsibility for developing the test.) Congressional consultations on this issue may
begin next week. We expect a decision in a few weeks.

3. Teacher of the Year: The President will meet with the Teacher of the Year and other
outstanding teachers at the White House on April 18. The overall message will be about
excellence in teaching. The President should highlight his proposal to enable more teachers to
seek certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. (The person
chosen as National Teacher ofthe Year is Board-certified.) In addition, we are working on a
proposal to support the development of standards and assessments for people just starting a
teaching career.

4. Roundtable/Town Hall on Standards: The President could participate in a session with
teachers, students, parents, and others to explain the standards associated with his 4th and 8th
grade tests. The roundtable would demonstrate with concrete examples the kind of student work
-- and the kind of teaching -- that reflects high standards.

5. Agency sponsorship of charter schools: We can set a process in motion for federal agencies
-- for example, NASA or the NSF -- to sponsor charter schools in partnership with teams of
teachers. We should keep this project small at the start and focus it on DC. It will probably take
us three or four months to be ready to announce the first sponsorship.

6. Incentives for engineering: We are currently exploring whether we can take executive
action (or should propose legislation) providing monetary incentives for students to take
engmeenng courses. We will know more within a week.

Welfare

1. Child Support: We can announce new child support enforcement numbers, along with the
submission of a new HHS report on child support enforcement and our submission of legislation
(previously announced) to make it a felony to cross state lines to evade child support obligations.
 The President has indicated that he would like to do a radio address on this subject.

2. Welfare Cabinet Meeting: The President will convene a Cabinet meeting on April 10 to
discuss agency plans to hire welfare recipients. We specifically announced in last month's
directive on governmental hiring of welfare recipients that this meeting would take place.

3. Statutory Rape/Teen Pregnancy Prevention: DO] should be ready sometime in April to
release a report on statutory rape and its relation to teen pregnancy rates. We could do a radio
address timed to coincide with the release of this report, discussing strategies to enforce statutory
rape laws and decrease teen pregnancies.

4. Internet in welfare offices: We are currently exploring ways to increase the access of
welfare offices around the country to the internet, with its wide range of job databanks and other


                                                         Automated Records Management System
                                                         Hex-Dump Conversion




                                                                                                     4

    informational services. Eli Segal's organization will probably play some role in this effort.
    Speaker Gingrich is also interested. We will have a proposal within a week or two, after we do
    some spadework on ensuring adequate private sector commitments and checking with certain
    agencies about their role in the project.

    5. Welfare business group announcement: Eli Segal is planning a formal announcement of
    his organization in late April, perhaps in Milwaukee -- where he would line up the support of a
    few hundred businesses, Mayor Norquist, Governor Thompson, and Mitch Fromstein, head of
    Manpower. This announcement has been postponed several times, so it is hard to know whether
    Eli will meet his new timetable. Sometime after the rollout of his organization, Eli would like to
    put together a welfare-to-work conference involving CEOs, the NGA, the DLC, and the White
    House.

    6. Welfare-to-Work Transportation Plan: We recently announced our Access to Jobs
    proposal, which would allocate $600 millionofNEXTEA funding to improve transportation
    systems so that welfare recipients and other low-income workers can get to work more easily.
    We are currently exploring whether we can take an executive action that would call further
    attention to these efforts. We should know in a week or two.

    7. Training for Child Care: The President has expressed interest in programs that train welfare
    recipients to become child care providers. Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Minnesota are all
    experimenting with such programs. We are just beginning to look into what the federal
    government can do to support programs of this kind.

    Crime, Drugs, Alcohol

    1. Hard Liquor Advertising: For years, the hard liquor industry voluntarily agreed not to show
    liquor ads on TV. Some companies have now broken that agreement. Working with other White
    House offices, we have prepared a letter for the President to sign requesting the FCC to
    investigate the effects of liquor advertising and take appropriate action. The President is
    currently scheduled to sign the letter on Tuesday.

    2. Sex Offender Registry: The President can announce at any time that the interim National
    Sex Offender Registration system -- which he directed the Attorney General to develop in a radio
    address last summer -- is now up and running. He also can announce right now that he is
    signing an Executive Order instructing the Attorney General and Secretary of Defense to ensure
    that sex offenders released from federal and military prisons are listed in the national registry.
    Finally, he can announce that the Justice Department is issuing guidelines to states on Megan's
    law, which requires community notification of sex offenders.

    3. National Anti-Drug Media Campaign: The President's FY 98 Budget Submission includes
    $175 million for a national anti-drug media campaign directed at youth. We will not be able to
    expend any funds on this initiative until we enact the appropriation bill, but ONDCP can expend


                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

discretionary funds in its FY 97 budget to begin producing anti-drug ads. At a Rose Garden
event, the President can kick off the campaign with one of the celebrities who has agreed to
appear in an ad. The President also can release a letter he is sending to every network
challenging them to match our contribution by dedicating more air time to anti-drug ads.
ONDCP is currently reaching out to celebrities and sports figures such as Michael Jordan, Grant
Hill, and Tiger Woods to tape anti-drug ads. This event should be ready sometime in April.

4. Anti-Gang Prosecutor Event: The cornerstone of the President's Anti-Gang and Youth
Violence Strategy is a $200 million anti-gang prosecution grant program. The President can
meet with prosecutors from across the country in the Oval Office where they will thank him for
his strong support in fighting gangs. The prosecutors -- Republican and Democrat -- would urge
Congress to move quickly to pass the President's bill. We recommend May for this event.

5. After-school Initiative Event: To highlight his new after-schools initiatives in the Anti-
Gang Bill, the President could visit a successful after-school program and meet with the kids
helped by the program. That day, he also would announce that HHS is providing several million
dollars in grants from its FY 97 appropriation for new after-school programs across the country.
This event should occur after the anti-gang event described above.

6. Victims Constitutional Amendment: In June 1996, the President announced his support for
a constitutional amendment for victims rights. At a White House event, the President could: (1)
urge Congress to pass the Amendment quickly; (2) receive a report from the Attorney General --
in response to his June Directive -- outlining measures taken by the Justice Department to
increase and improve Federal services and protections for victims of crime; (3) announce the
creation of a Federal victim notification system; and (4) announce additional funding from the
Victims Crime Fund -- which is larger than ever before -- to go to victims services and shelters
across the country. We could take these actions during the week of April 14-18, which is
National Crime Victims Week, or at some later date.

7. Smart Guns. The National Institute of Justice is about three weeks away from announcing
that it has chosen a prototype "smart gun" for testing in the field. The gun will have an "Action
Radio Frequency Tag" that permits the gun to be fired only when it is within three feet of a
wristband that the police officer will wear. The gun will also have a "laser-aiming element" that
makes a red dot appear on the person at whom the gun is pointing. This feature apparently serves
as an effective warning to the CUlprit that he should surrender. NIJ will provide a $500,000 grant
to a consortium of companies to demonstrate the gun and train police officers in its use. We can
prepare an event to highlight this announcement, which we can also tie in to our juvenile justice
bill.

8. Report on Bomb-Making: The Justice Department has prepared a report, as required by
Congress, on the public availability of information on how to construct bombs. The report
concludes that such information is widely available, especially on the internet, and that some
legislation would be appropriate. The DOJ legislative proposal is narrower than one previously


                                                            Automated Records Management System
                                                            Hex-Dump Conversion

offered by Sen. Feinstein, and we are looking into whether Sens. Feinstein and Biden would
embrace it or criticize it for not going far enough. We should know more within the week.

9. Ban on Importation of Ammunition Clips: We are looking into the possibility of endorsing
Sen. Feinstein's bill to close a loophole in the assault weapons ban by prohibiting the importation
of large-capacity ammunition feeding devices that now can come into the country. Our decision
about whether to proceed with this endorsement is complicated by prior agreements with Rep.
Dingell. We will have a recommendation soon.

10. Nanny Checks: We could introduce legislation prepared by the Justice Department that
would facilitate criminal checks for non-criJ;11inal purposes -- for example, a check on a potential
nanny or schoolbus driver. But we oversold the Oprah bill a couple of years ago as a solution to
this problem; if we do another big event, we will have to admit that our purported solution didn't
do much of anything.

11. Brady Law Reaction: The Supreme Court should rule soon on the constitutionality ofthe
Brady law, and most experts think the Court will invalidate the law. We are developing a multi-
pronged strategy to respond to the decision. The Attorney General and Secretary Rubin will send
a letter to every police chief and sheriff urging them to continue to enforce the Brady Law
voluntarily; the AG and Secretary also will announce pledges from numerous sheriffs and police
chiefs to do so. Finally, the Administration will send to Congress new legislation, less subject to
constitutional challenge, ensuring continued background checks.

12. Internet Porn Case: The Supreme Court probably will strike down the Communications
Decency Act this spring. We must begin to consider our response to this decision, including the
desirability of new legislation.

13. Crack Cocaine Sentencing: The Sentencing Commission will propose amendments to the
sentencing guidelines on May 1 to reduce the disparity between crack and powder cocaine
sentences. We must begin to consider what position to take on these new recommendations.

Family

1. Family leave executive order: We have legal authority to issue an executive order granting
federal employees the additional family leave provided in our legislative proposal. We can be
ready to go on this proposal in a matter of days. We recommend announcing it in a radio address
just preceding the Early Childhood Development Conference.

Service Summit

1. Scholars' Program: We announced last year a $1,000 scholarship for high school students
who have performed outstanding service, with the federal government putting up $500 and a
community or service organization (e.g., Lions, Elks, Kiwanis, Moose) putting up the rest. We


                                                                       Automated Records Management System
                                                                       Hex-Dump Convemon




                                                                                                     7

     are working with CNS to put together an event or radio address highlighting this program, which
     might include an announcement of matching funds obtained so far, a call for applications, and
     perhaps an award of the very first scholarships.

     2. Commitments/Adopt-a-School: We will soon be ready to announce "commitments" from
     the federal government to the service summit. One commitment would expand agencies'
     existing adopt-a-school programs: a realistic goal is 2,000 schools by the year 2000. Other
     commitments would lead agencies to forge partnerships with service organizations (possibly
     including state and local youth conservation corps) to achieve some of the President's core
     priorities -- in education, health care, the environment, and so forth. We need to have a package
     ready by the time of the summit, but we may be ready with this package in as little as two weeks.

     3. EO on Federal Employees' Service: We are reviewing whether to expand an Executive
     Order issued by President Bush to make service and volunteer work easier for federal employees.
      We will know in a couple of weeks whether to proceed with this idea.

     4. Week of Service. Some or all of the above ideas can be combined with the Week of Service,
     starting on April 14. We are exploring ways to involve a wide range of federal officials, as well
     as AmeriCorps members, ArneriCorps alumni, and returned Peace Corps volunteers, in the
     numerous activities celebrating service that will occur during this week around the country.

     5. College Loan Relief for Service. We are exploring the idea of giving young people engaged
     in service some kind of relief from payments due on college loans. We will know in a couple of
     weeks what kind of proposal would make sense.

     Environment

     1. Brownfields: The EPA wants to roll out an expansion of the existing Brownfields pilot
     program in about two months. A number of other agencies can announce actions at this time to
     encourage Brownfields cleanup and redevelopment. The Administration will also resubmit
     legislation creating a new tax incentive and grant program to encourage the redevelopment of
     Brownfields.

     2. Right-to-know law: EPA should be ready in one to two months to issue a rule extending
     disclosure obligations under the right-to-know law to a number of additional industries --
     probably including mining, hazardous waste handlers, and utilities.

     3. Safe water regulations: EPA will propose regulations to require water utilities to provide
     information to consumers about what is in tap water. The proposal will not be ready until
     September or so.
