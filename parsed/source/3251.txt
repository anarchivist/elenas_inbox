TEXT:
1. As I've told both of you, Jack has asked me to do an edit on the curent DOJ
brief.  I'd be grateful for your input. No point is too big or too small.    If
you want to mark up a draft and give it to me, that's great.  If you want to
make just a few general comments, that's great too.  I'd like your comments
sometime tomorrow, so I can get this under way as quickly as possible.
2. And as I've told Dinah, we need to decide one of these days whether we wish
to seek cert on the areas vs. sales issue.  Jack is very much of the mind to
defer to you guys: if you want to seek cert (even recognizing we won't get it),
he'll argue the case to the SG. Let me know.
