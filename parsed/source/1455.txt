TEXT:
One more thing:  It could be argued that this is different from the
"eyeglasses for children" situation because it applies only when the
insurance company covers all other pharmaceuticals.   (There's a kind of
sexism implicit in the exclusion of contraceptives from this category.)
Just a thought; I have no particular view on this question.
