Subject:         Q&A on Second Hand Smoke and Heart Disease Finding

NYT and WP report today on a Harvard research finding that regular
exposure to second hand smoke almost doubles one's risk of heart
disease.    OSHA proposed regulating second hand smoke in workplaces in
1994, closed the comment period in February, 1996, and is currently
reviewing comments. Below are Qs&As on the study and OSHA's rule drafted
in consultation w/OSHA and HHS.

Q.         What will the Administration do to respond to these findings?

A.      Second hand smoke is an important area of concern, and we're
disturbed by this particular finding.   The Department of Health and Human
Services is reviewing the finding.

Q.      When will OSHA issue its rule on workplace smoking and what is
taking so long?

A.      OSHA is currently reviewing the 115, 000 comments it received on
the proposed rule and will move the rule forward as expeditiously as
possible.   OSHA typically receives only several dozen to several hundred
comments on its rules -- and is taking the time necessary to carefully
review the very large volume of comments on the second hand smoke
regulation.
