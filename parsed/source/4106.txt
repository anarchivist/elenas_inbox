Subject: Invitation to have lunch with the President's Advisory Board on
Race

When the President's Advisory Board on Race meets on Monday, July 14, they
will take an hour break, between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., for lunch.   At
that time, members 'of the Race Working Group are invited to join the board
for an informal, buffet lunch in the Eisenhower Room of the White House
Conference Center.

Please let me know by close of business Thursday, July 10, if you plan to
attend, so that we can give an accurate count to the caterer. We will
assume that anyone who has not responded by that time will NOT come to
lunch.

Those who plan to attend should meet the advisory board in the Eisenhower
Room at 1:00 p.m.  See you there!
