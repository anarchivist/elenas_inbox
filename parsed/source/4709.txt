TEXT:
Yes, but only if the understanding is that we will seek a legislative fix
(if needed), consistent with our position since 1994, that workfare
benefits are not subject to FICA and do not qualify for EITC.  This is
what we are going to tell the governors starting this week, in an attempt
to dissuade them from attacking our decision on FLSA.  The function of a
working group i~ only to work out the details. Does everyone agree?

Subject:         proper taxation of workfare benefits

Folks,
I brought up the idea of a joint DPC/NEC decision process with Gene
Sperling at the NEC staff meeting on Friday and he said we should go ahead
and get this started so we can come to an agreement in relatively short
order.

My thinking on this is that we should let the current process involving
IRS, Labor, and HHS and focussing on administrative solutions chug along
to determine the appropriate interpretation of current law.  But we should
set up a parallel process with these agencies (and any other interested
ones) to develop a legislative solution to this issue. There is a chance
that such a legislative fix can be added to whatever tax bill will be
constructed this summer.  I suggest that we try to convene a group from
Labor, HHS, Treasury, DPC, NEC, OMB, and CEA this coming week to get this
process started.  What do you think?
                                        Mark
