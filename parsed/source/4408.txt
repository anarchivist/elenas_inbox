Subject: dinner tuesday



I hope you got the message on Sataaurday from Leslie or Marjorie in Maria's
office. Since it turns out that Maria won't get back from Philadelphia with
FLOTUS until 8:45 or so, seems to me we should try to get together on
Tuesday instead. We COULD go ahead without Maria, but at this start up
phase it would be great to be together if reasonably possible.
