I spoke to Gene last night; he feels strongly that a $150 million' increase
for Head Start (above the OMB-recommended level of $4.489 billion) is
inadequate. He is willing to accept $400 million for the Early Learning
fund only if there is also a $200 million increase in Head Start (above
the OMB recommendation, for a total increase of $334 million over FY 98
enacted). As you know, DPC is recommending, as part of the child care
initiative, about $500 million over four years to expand Early Head
Start. I have not seen this item in any OMB materials. A $200 million
overall increase for FY 99 would allow for an expansion of Early Head
Start in that year , should we decide to go that way in the context of
Head Start reauthorization.

Barbara, I know that you reached agreement with Bob Shireman and others on
$150 million for Head Start.  I apologize for the late notice on this.
Thank you.


Emil
