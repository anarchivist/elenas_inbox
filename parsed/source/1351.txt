subject: DOL FLSA document that's on hold

As you know, DOL's technical assistance document on the new House FLSA
plan is still on hold and doesn't appear to be going anywhere.  If it
should suddenly spring free again, we have to decide whether to include a
new section that DOL just added on the prevailing wage.  It's purely
descriptive.

My inclination is to drop it, since this prevailing wage thing is going to
get dropped in all likelihood, just so that we aren't highlighting it
ourselves.  Not sure this is completely justifiable; but wondered if you
had an opinion on this.
