PRINTER FONT 12 - POINT- COURIER
         The President is today issuing two directives to mitigate
the unwarranted effects of the welfare bill on legal aliens and
their children.
         The first directs the Secretary of Agriculture to grant a
blanket waiver allowing any state, subject to certain legal
restrictions, to extend the certification periods -- that is, the
time elapsing between certifications of eligibility for food
stamps -- that currently apply to legal aliens receiving food
stamp assistance.    The effect of this directive will be to allow
states to continue providing food stamp benefits to legal aliens
and their children; this is because, under the terms of the
statute, benefits to such individuals are cut off only at the
time of recertification of their eligibility for food stamps.
When a state extends the certification period, it effectively
pushes back the date on which a legal alien will be deprived of
food stamp benefits.
         Extension of the certification period will allow those who
have applied for citi'zenship to continue to receive food stamp
assistance while the INS reviews their applications.    More
generally, extension of the certification periods of legal aliens
will give states the time to develop the procedures necessary to
make accurate determinations as to the many factual matters
such as immigration classification, veteran status,' or work
history -- that the new law makes relevant to eligibility.    In
this way, the directive will decrease inaccurate or inequitable
decisions to cut off food stamp benefits.
        This waiver, however, will have certain limits. Under
current law, the Department of Agriculture cannot allow states to
extend certification periods beyond one year for most aliens or
two years for certain elderly or disabled aliens. Neither can
the Department allow states to extend certification periods
beyond August 22, 1997, even when a two
o
-year period would extend
beyond that date.
        The second directive instructs the Attorney General and
other'heads of agencies to make continued efforts to remove
bureaucratic obstacles to naturalization.  The Immigration and
Naturalization Service already has made giant steps in this area,
devoting more resources to processing naturalization applications


and reducing long waiting lists. This directive instructs the
Attorney General to continue to increase staff and facilities
used to review citizenship applications and to develop novel and
effective means, including joint efforts with community groups,
of assisting potential and current applicants for naturalization.
        In addition, the directive instructs the heads of all

relevant agencies, working with White House staff, to develop
public/private partnerships devoted to providing English
o
-language
training to applicants for citizenship; make outreach efforts to
those wishing to become citizens; and provide special assistance
to refugees and asylees.
        These directives mitigate the harshest effects of the
welfare bill on legal aliens and their children.  The President
will continue to look, and has instructed relevant agencies to
look, for any possible additional ways of accomplishing this
object.
