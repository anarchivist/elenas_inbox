     TEXT:
     somehow the importance of all this is eluding me. and i know that if we
     have to educate the public on what a totipotent cell is, we're in big
     trouble.
     I'm assuming that you're talking to neil and rachel about what we can
     expect from nbac tomorow (and when).  let me or bruce know this afternoon.

     I agree.  My point wasn't that the use of embryo was incorrect in the
     Shapiro letter, but that strategically we should seek to draw a bright
     line between an embryo that is the product of conception, and a totipotent
     cell that is derived from and is genetically identical to a somatic cell.
     The Shapiro letter was an opportunity to do that.  Educating the public
     about the difference is critical to winning public support for federally
     funding totipotent cell research, which should be one of our goals.

    Jerry: I don't believe the use of the term embryo in the Shapiro letter is
    incorrect.  Cultured stem cells were derived from embryos and fetuses,
    which clearly triggers the Congressional ban on embryo research.   The cow
    egg/human somatic cell fusion product was reported to generate embryonic
    stem cell-like cells.   Perhaps the letter could have put more distance
    between the cow egg/human fusion and the creation of embryos (i.e., the
~RMS Email System                                                                          Page 2 of2
    ethical issues are the same as those associated with xenotransplantation) ,
    but we know so little about their results. I suspect this will be an issue
    NBAC will address.   I agree that we should not equate a totipotent cell
    with an embryo.    Cliff
