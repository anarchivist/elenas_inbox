TEXT:
We should be ready to publish within a couple of weeks guidance on the
issue of when someone counts as a "public charge" for immigration
purposes. The guidance is designed to ensure as far as possible that
legal immigrants will not suffer adverse consequences if they apply for
benefits (e.g., Medicaid) to which they are entitled.  The immigrant
community will be very pleased with this guidance, and the Vice President
really should announce it.
