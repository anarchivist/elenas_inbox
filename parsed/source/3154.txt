TEXT:
Right.  If we decide we want to do this kind of tree-swapping, it would be best
to get legislation making clear that we have the authority.   But even in the
absence of such legislation (or pending such legislation), we might want to go
ahead anyway, arguing that we already have the requisite authority. As noted in
the legal section of the memo' on the Garemendi proposal, that argument (at least
as to two of the three versions of the proposal) is a close but credible one.
