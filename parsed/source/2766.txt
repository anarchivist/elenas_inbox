oo.you guys want to do this? I asked Mary Smith of our staff to check in
with David Beier before we put in any formal scheduling request.  It seems
like a good event for the VP.

Subject:         FAA scheduling request

Attached is the scheduling request for the President to announce the award
of contracts to manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
detection devices for installation at airports throughout the United
States. Bruce had told me to bounce this idea off Sosnik who was
interested in the event (although it might be a better VP event.) 00 you
all want to submit this as a possible event?   Transportation keeps
calling to inquire whether we are going to do this or not, because, if
not, they would like to announce the award of these contracts soon.   Let
me know, Mary

Here is the scheduling request for the President to announce the award of
contracts to manufacture more than 150 new FAA-certified explosive
detection devices for installation at airports throughout the United
States. While this is part of an ogoing effort to strengthen airport
security since the Gore Commission report came out in 1996, neither the WH
nor OOT has ever done an event on it.   Are you OK with submitting this?
Let me know, Mary

                                   purchase innovative security equipment to help insure the
                                   safety of the flying public. This announcement would be
                                   the purchase of 21 FAA-certified explosives detection
                                   systems and 135 trace explosives detection devices, which
                                   add to the multi-year deployment of innovative security
                                   equipment recommended by the Commission, In FY99,
                                   FAA has $100 million to continue this deployment, and the
