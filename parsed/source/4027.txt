TEXT:
I talked with Dan Turullo and he affirmed that we need do nothing more
than take out the quotation remarks in the way I indicated on the copy I
marked up.   I gave Dan every opportunity to demand more, but he declined.
He said he understood that limitation of the ban to a particular
technology, etc. was part of our policy; I said it was; he said then
that's what we should say to President -- we just shouldn't constrain him
 (Dan) by offering the President particular language.  Thanks.
