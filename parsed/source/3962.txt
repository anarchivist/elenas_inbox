I am comfortable with these minimal changes; Elena, do you want to share
with Sylvia or John?

House is just coming into session now; my understanding is that it will be
voted on early this afternoon, with Senate action to follow.  Don't have a
strong sense of what time Senate should wrap up, but we do expect the
Senate to have a final vote today.

I'll let you know if I get more updated information.

DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT (IDEA) REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION


       I am pleased that the House and Senate today took a major step toward ensuring
high quality educational opportunities for all students with disabilities by voting to
reauthorize the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

        Over the last 20 years, the IDEA has made it possible for young people with disabilities
to reach their full potential. This legislation strengthens and reaffirms our commitment to these
children and their parents, and I look forward to signing it into law.

        This legislation is the result of a bipartisan process that involved hard work not only by
both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress but also by the Department of Education and
representatives of the education-and disability communities. I hope that we can continue in this
bipartisan spirit and move forward on the rest of our agenda to improve education and prepare
America for the 21st Century.
