TEXT:
I think B is by far the best in terms of message.  Rather than requiring
us to make a case about tobacco company profits generally, we would be
saying only that tobacco companies shouldn't use the recent settlement as
an opportunity to gouge consumers.  It seems as if this option also best
responds to Rubin's point about the sensitivity of the business community
to excess profits taxes, since it's the most limited (i.e.,
tobacco-company-specific) in terms of rationale.
