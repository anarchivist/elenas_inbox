TEXT:
Attached is the latest draft of the veto statement.                   As I said on the phone,
Bruce and I think that to the extent possible, the language should come from
that.        I am faxing you a hard copy of the statement indicating the most
important parts.                   I have also edited the paragraph of the memo describing the
bill to highlight the most important provisions.                   (By the by, and as my edits
reflect, do not say that the statute of repose applies only to certain products;
that is the position of the people who support the bill; we think the Conference
Report manages to apply applies to lots and lots of products.)
