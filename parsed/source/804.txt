Subject:         Definition of' federal public benefits

As we get closer to issuing this interim verification guidance from DOJ,
there are still 2 outstanding definitions of the welfare law we need to
finish up.  One, means tested benefits, is about to get issued.   The other
is "federal public benefits."  Federal public benefits are denied to
illegals, so this is an illegals issue.

In a nutshell, HHS has proposed a definition that draws the line at
programs that require some establishment of eligibility.  All the lawyers
(HHS, DOJ, OMB) seem to think this is fine legally.  From a practical
standpoint, the major program that this definition would affect is
community health centers, and maybe some similar discretionary health
programs.  Illegals WOULD be eligible for these programs.

There don't seem to be any other major impacts (although HHS hasn't shared
their paper with us yet).  Education is specifically OK because the law
exempts them. Housing would appear to be off-limits to illegals because
there is an eligibility determination.

This comes down to a policy call.  I hear Ken is probably fine with this
proposal.  It would be good to decide this before the interim verification
guidance goes out in the next 2 weeks or so, because if this is missing
from it HHS will get a lot of questions. Reactions?
