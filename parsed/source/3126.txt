TEXT:
I haven't gotten the complete story on this yet, but it appears that:
1. The four BLM sales on today's list (of 5 1/2) may not be pre-1990 Hogan
sales after all; they may be real 318 sales.  If so, of course, we should have
reported them to the court before now.
2. The Forest Service may not have completed searching its records for pre-1990
Hogan sales.  If so, we'll have to tell the court that the search is not done
and file a supplemental pleading when it is.
Hard to believe ...
I'll let you both know when I learn more.
