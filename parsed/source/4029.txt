Subject:         Re: draft Brady statement

That looks pretty good. But i think the opening paragraph should be a
little more upbeat about our determination to keep handguns out of the
hands of criminals. Maybe "I am disappointed in the Supreme Court's
decision to rule part of the Brady Law unconstitutional. The Brady Law
has kept 186,000 etc from purchasing handguns. And I will do everything
in my power to make sure that we continue to keep handguns out of the
hands of criminals."

The sooner we get to what we're going to do about it and the less we .
lament the decision, the less it will look like a total defeat.
