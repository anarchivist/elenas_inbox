TEXT:
Here's another.   Out it right before the liability question (i.e., second
to last) :

Q:  Does your budget assume that the revenues from tobacco legislation
will come from increased excise taxes, or from industry payments pursuant
to a settlement?

A:  The budget does not say how the funds will be raised: it is compatible
either with increased excise taxes or with a schedule of industry payments
established in a settlement.
