TEXT:
I agree with Bruce as to the HHS view on religion and the SSA view on penalties
for fraud.   Apart from anything else, these are very weak constitutional claims.
I also agree with Bruce as to insert A.   We took this out because it seemed so
weak as to discredit other arguments.   I see no reason to put it back in.
Insert B seems quite repetitive of the two paragraphs on p. 5.   Is that insert
supposed to replace those paragraphs? If not, it's not necessary.    If so, it
seems too brief to me (see my discussion with Steve and Bruce last week.)   How
about a compromise: delete the first paragraph on p.5; replace it with the first
sentence of Insert B; then (in the same, rather than a new, pargaraph) replace
the first sentence of the second paragraph with the statement "We doubt,
howe'Jer, that such an argument would succeed." And then, continue on with the
rest of that paragraph (starting with "First ... ") .
