TEXT:
If I were the Republicans (and I wanted a bill, rather than an issue), I would
respond to the President's letter by providing an exception for serious health
consequences and then defining serious to exclude all psychological, mental,
e~otional etc. health issues.  This will lead to a very serious Walter problem
-- mucn more serious than the mere use of the word "serious" -- because there is
at least one SCt case (and probably more) that explicitly says that mental
health is a facet of health just like any other.  I just thought I'd warn you.
