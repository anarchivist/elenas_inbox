TEXT:
I got your memo; many thanks. There's absoutely no reason why my name should be
at the top of the memo, so you should take it off. Which doesn't mean I don't
think this a good memo; I do. But you did the work, so you should get the
credit. Otherwise, I do think the recommendation section should be enhanced,
with some discussion of both politics and policy. Thanks again, and send me the
next (or final) draft.
