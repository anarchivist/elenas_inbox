Elena--I guess this answers our questions.  Now we just have to figure out
the right people to talk to about welfare.  Thanks,

Maria,

 I ran your questions by Dawn and Kathy and we agreed that what you are
.proposing is no problem as long as the individuals with whom you are
 working are not directed by the White House and as long as they do not
 represent themselves as having an official .relationship with the White
 House.  If all we are doing is serving as an information conduit, it is ok
 as long as we provide similar information to other interested persons.

                                I hope.this helps.
