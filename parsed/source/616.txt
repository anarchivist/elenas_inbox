   Subject:         Conference Announcement

   THE WHITE HOUSE

   Office of the Press Secretary


   For Immediate
   Release                                                     March 13,
   1997

           Today, Hillary and I are pleased to announce that on April 17,
   1997, we will host the White House Conference on Early Childhood
   Development and Learning: What New Research on the Brain Tells Us About
   Our Youngest Children. The Conference, which will take place at the White
   House, will spotlight exciting new findings about how our children'
   develop, and explore how we can make the most of this information to give
   our children what they need to thrive,

           We hope that this one-day Conference will make the latest
   scientific research, nearly all supported by the federal government, more
   accessible and understandable to AmericaD,s families. The research clearly
   indicates the importance of childrenD,s first few years to their later
   success in school and in life. This Conference is a continuation of my
   AdministrationD,s commitment to children and, in particular, it follows
   HillaryD,s work over the years on issues relating to early childhood
   development.

           The Conference will examine how we can use this new research in
   practical ways -- to be better parents, more informed care-givers and more
   responsive members of our communities.  It will also explore how this
   information can be used by all members of our society -- from corporate
   executives to pediatricians, from ministers to elected officials -- to
   help strengthen AmericaD,s families.

           Parents desperately want to do right by their children, and we all have a
   role to play in making sure they have the tools they need to do the best
   job they can.  We believe this Conference can make ,a valuable contribution.
